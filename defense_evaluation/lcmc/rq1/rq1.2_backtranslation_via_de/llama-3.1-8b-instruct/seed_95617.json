            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views on various issues seem outdated. Many people think the Catholic Church is losing influence because it's not very open to many things. They have strong views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can be a turn-off for some people. If they were to adapt to a newer way of thinking, they might not lose their following. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of how it views certain issues. The Catholic Church is against abortion, which can make it difficult for people who are pro-choice to be part of the community. The same goes for gay marriage and other similar issues. The Church's stance on these topics can be a major reason for people to leave. I don't see why priests can't be married or have female priests. The Church says that priests are \"married\" to God, but I don't think that's a valid reason for not allowing them to have a family life. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family life, so why can't priests?",
            "Personally, I'm not opposed to same-sex marriage. I think it's not a decision that people make consciously. So I think that gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really put much thought into the topic, but I think it's wrong to say that it's not okay.\n\nIt doesn't seem like they have a choice in how they are. I mean, I was born straight, and another person might be born gay. It doesn't seem like they make a conscious decision that they should be held responsible for.\n\nI think it's wrong for the federal government to get involved, as it's not a legal issue or a moral issue. I don't think these gay people should be put on a stage like they made a wrong decision or choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government really has any say in this matter. It's hard [laughs].\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, nor is it a moral concern. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interfere in people's lives, and they're just who they are. Gay people are who they were born to be, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn't a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's just different and there are so many different aspects that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin, heads will never be tails but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. A lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just, it's a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up on is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. If you're allowing someone a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. His take on gay marriage actually goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, a lot of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "First of all, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a medication is illegal, it doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. First of all, if we make it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a medication is illegal, it doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. It's not harmful. You know what I mean.\n\nYeah, first of all, I mean there are a lot of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, vicodin, percocet, that kind of thing, and those are controlled substances.

            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. \nI'm not as strict as I used to be. \nI know, even as I've grown older, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. \nAnd I would get cute little dresses. \nAnd matching shoes. \nAnd a matching purse. \nThat was what I always did. I went to a private school. \nAnd I would see my friends there on the weekends. \nAnd we would just go. \nBut now, as I've grown older, they've created like a youth mass. \nAnd they cut it down to 30 minutes. \nAnd people dress a lot more casually. \nEspecially in the summer people come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. \nYou have the families there who are just running late. \nSo I think it's become a lot more casual. \nEven at the morning masses, where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. \nThose are okay too. \nBut it's just a lot more casual than it used to be. \nAs for other things, \nThat's the biggest thing that I've noticed. \nThat's the church I know. \nI don't know the politics within the church and whatnot. \nBut yes, that's it. \n[OK, in regards to all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] \nI don't think these things could have been avoided. \nBecause \nThere are men who are married. \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles. \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction to young kids. \nSo \nI think even if you allowed them to get married, it's just the person, not because they're allowed to get married or not. \nI also think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. \nThere are religions that allow them to get married, where they could do so \nLike Seventh Heaven. \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something. \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey allow them to get married. \nSo \nI know it's a bit different. \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe think about a different faith. \n[OK, can you elaborate on your answer a bit more?] \nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nThe changes \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] \nOh, on pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nI think, \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality is before \nUm \nGenetics, I think it's based on genetics. \nI think people are born that way. \nI don't think it has anything to do with upbringing. \nIt might have a bit to do with this case \nBut \nI think it's their genetics. \nAnd \nYou can't hide that through a marriage. \nYou can try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out. \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. \nUm \nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them. \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew. \n[OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] \nUm no.",
            "(laughs) Initially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext; there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that the Bush administration early on connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq war just boils my blood. \n\nUm... It just seems to me that the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that, to me, is a form of malfeasance in office, I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution, and has been trying to marginalize it since September 11th at least, I mean. I think that they... Um... They came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nUm... That last part... I forget the name of the... Um... Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office... Um... But it seems to me that the younger Bush had a blood vendetta kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration, and I think that in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it’s gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war, and even more people would die as a result. Um... I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, coming in to try to restore order. But I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either, because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because... Um... Iraq’s sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue, there, because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Um... Oh, I can’t remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening in the country, and even Muktada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we’re still dealing with lots of radical elements that are vying for control of the government, and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm... (laughs) Not that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I was just going to talk into it? \nOkay, cool\nAch yeah\nAch\nOkay, I'm sorry\nOkay\nHow I feel about the war in Iraq\nLet me think\nUm\nAt this point I feel it's kind of pointless because it wasn't even declared a war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big revenge thing because we thought it was the Iraq who carried out the 9/11 attacks\nSo I don't feel like I'm a big fan of the war in Iraq\nSo I don't really follow it\nI don't know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we're just there to try and build democracy so it can become like another US thing\nAnd also so we can get oil and other resources from them\nBut it's no reason to stay there because it's just making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd if we stay there then what's going to happen is we have to try and build democracy which is going to take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day\nAnd then if we leave they're going to be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me think\nOh, this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don't know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh, this is hard\nAch\nHmm, I don't know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOkay\nThank you\nUm\nWell, um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair\nI don't think we should call it a war anymore\nBecause I don't think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we're big and American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore\nBecause we didn't even call it\nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it wasn't declared by congress\nI think that's how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it's\nI just don't think it's a big point to stay there and try\nActually no\nI do think it's a point to stay there and try to help them\nBut it's also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like\nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the US right now\nBecause of what it's doing and what it's doing to like\nRemember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nThe Vietnam War was an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war\nAnd he's like saying\nHe'll be called like that president forever\nBecause he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don't you?\nUh\nOkay yeah\nUm\nHm\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt's like\nIt's hard to say\nI want them to be there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it's going to be even worse for them\nAnd it's going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the US will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them\nAnd they've been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it's going to\nThat it's kind of hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat's about it\nOkay",
            "I don't know, I don't feel comfortable with it. It's not right that it's legalized or that a state even declares it legal. I think it's really up to the churches because in the constitution it says church and state are separated. It's clear, it's clear, I don't know. It's clearly stated and I think you should do anything to try to enforce any kind of power over it. Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution. So, in regards to the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think they are really picking one church over another. Because as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think it's really up to the state to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make legal. And legal.\n\nI don't know, well, the separation of church and state is almost a key aspect of the constitution, and what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States. And although they had planned on amending, I think even amending it would be completely wrong and in direct contradiction to what's already been said and written there. And I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that actually restricts the people rather than the government. So, I don't think it's right in that aspect.\n\nI don't know, no, I don't believe that the federal government or any government should get involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So, I really think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it I think by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\nMmm, not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay \nThe war in Iraq \nNow \nTo start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nAh \nI \nI myself am against the war and \nEspecially against a preemptive strike I was against that \nAh \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they made \n\nI mean \nA \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible and \nWhat they \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the country's government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nAh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nAh \nBecause there because there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to the end but again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is too much to continue risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue \nAnd this is where we get our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions was before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nAh \nI just hope that it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "I think we should see, I'm for gay marriage, I've always been. I really think it's a personal preference and it's something that's been proven more and more to be biological rather than sociological, instead of giving people fewer rights because of something they have no control over. I think it's quite inhumane and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think that politics and government in general should have anything to do with it, it's a personal matter, it's a household matter. I mean, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. I mean, they function just like any other family, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would and I think that Bush is trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, I think it's quite ridiculous.\n\nYeah, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from various different publications and TV reports or newspapers, it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be homosexual, as opposed to growing up with four sisters and being the only brother, and you know, not having a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side, as opposed to sociological.\n\nWell, other than the obvious, I think marriage is something that if a man and a woman want to do it, they can do it without telling a single person, run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's quite the type of thing that should be a personal, private, interpersonal matter, rather than in the public domain, in the national or federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "As an RA, I've already had to deal with this, when you put something on the internet, it becomes a public forum, it's completely public. You can't just post something that's going to color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there in the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get the bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin; someone went to the school and they had to act on it. They can't just let it sit there, then God forbid something happens and they could have prevented it. [Right] On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just mess around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. I apologize, I couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were certain things there that he may have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you post things into the public internet forum, there really is no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be befriending their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to their attention, then it's a completely different thing. Um, yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a fake Facebook or Myspace account and befriend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't befriend my residents because honestly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see it and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Um, not really.",
            "I think the war has been going on for too long. I think the purpose was good at first. To restore democracy in another country. But I think we've lost sight of that purpose and we're now maybe just doing it to prove we're some kind of superpower in the world. I think the original motivation, considering George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein, was questionable. So I think if the original purpose was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal matters involved, I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. I think we got our message across in the first couple of months after starting the war, I think that was a statement in itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year or several years, I just think it's gone on too long. \n\nYes, I think, I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. But I don't think our justification has been deteriorated and misleading over time. It seems like we're still at war just to be at war. And we don't want to come out of this thing without a clear end, without a victory or whatever. \n\nYes, I think it's been long enough and it should stop. I mean, there's a point in time when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We've been draining our own economy for too long, spending billions of dollars on wars on our own turf, such as poverty and whatnot, which we should be spending on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's been going on for too long. \n\nYes, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be a long-term goal in our budget. There are things like poverty or internal improvements, public roads or anything related to schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, which I think that money could be used better. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nI think that's it.",
            "I'd like to clarify a point that\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like that\n\nOkay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy, on platforms like Myspace if you post information on the internet it's almost like it's available to everyone. And I understand on Myspace, you know, in order to see someone's profile, you have to have someone else be a member, you have to add them as a friend or something like that, so if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it, you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you post information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think it was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's different profiles to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's just look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on the situation they came across that profile, or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just happened to see that, or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something, so I don't really know.\n\nYes, um, well, I mean, I personally don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook, I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just wanted to prove how easy it is to get information, and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away, and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I post, but at the same time, I think the whole point of having one is so you can communicate with some of your friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue, because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never really know who can see what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how the high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace, and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people what they could and couldn't do. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm, yeah, we only have this and then one more time to talk about the Iraq War. Yeah, I mean, I feel guilty talking about it, I mean, I hate to say, you know, that I was against it from the beginning, joining the bandwagon of people who are like, oh, I was against it from the start. I was, but it's not really important anymore, because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls, they've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and, I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops who are there, like the US troops who are there right now, think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in, it was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster, there's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states, I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration, or previous administrations, to understand, they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone is arguing that he isn't, but, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, just like quicksand when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them, I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that, but, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now, and like these, these are the people that we're trying to save, the people we're trying to help, telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that, and at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens, if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision to leave, and then you know at least we'll, I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we are now, where we stand.",
            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. And it's not just for women. I think it has to do with the specific field of work that one is in. I mean, in general, I feel that women have it harder because there's the \"glass ceiling\" where, even though it's supposed to be about equality, most people have a hard time finding someone to work under a woman if they're a man because the society has been raised for so long. And often, women in the workplace see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position because, historically, it's been shown that women are not usually in the upper levels of the business world. And I think the same thing goes for men. And in other fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really rare for a man to be at home. And often, people look down on that because society thinks, \"Oh, you're a man, you should be working. You should be the breadwinner of your family. Why are you staying at home?\" And it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has a better job, and it's working out fine for them. But society looks down on that. And in the fashion industry, often people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense. But I think it's because men who are typically into fashion... I think they have different lifestyles. And if a man has the typical lifestyle and is in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women? Like, you don't really know what our case is like? Like these other guys.\" And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of difficult because society has a fixed mindset and, obviously, we've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow. So, I think that if we continue to work at the pace we are now because women are advancing to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, but it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And similarly, as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, maybe the woman has a better job or she wants to be the one who works.\" And then for people in fashion, it'll be like, \"Oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and so they know where I'm coming from.\" So, I guess you have to kind of promote it by showing the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but showing the qualities of them. Because if you force it, people will resist. And I think we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So, I don't really know if there's anything we can do now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time. Yes. And I think they're also discriminated against each other, depending on the type of job you have or where you come from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't so good, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men will look down on you and be like, \"How do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, sometimes it's where you come from that discriminates against you, and from gender to gender. And I don't know, I think that would be another example. Not really.",
            "I mean they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it. But that made it from an offense to a traffic fine. You know what I mean, you get cited and you don’t have to get arrested and brought to jail and all that. But I think if someone gets caught and gets cited, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that. But there are arguments that it is expensive to arrest people and bring them in and to book them and then to let them go, and it costs a lot to bring them to court, maybe twice, maybe three times, and to appoint a public defender, and to pay the judge and the state attorney’s office has to take up the case and basically press the charges. I mean all these things cost a lot. And I mean if you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean many of them are philosophically not willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money. Like many communities are rightfully against marijuana and they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, to a certain extent, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for homeless people. But I think it’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want to have everywhere, all over the streets and stuff, but there’s a whole financial element to it as well, other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be that way. Well no, I mean I don’t know how I would feel about it, well if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, and I mean maybe a lot of people would say they’re smoking and driving, and it’s still a taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I find it awkward for a lot of people. But I think in general, alcohol has a much greater impact on your motor skills. But I think in general, marijuana has a more significant impact on people’s lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making skills. I mean but they both have their drawbacks. And I mean I think when it comes to substances in general, there are no two people who react the same way, I mean, and then there are people who have normal personalities and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then there are people who know how to exercise moderation, and then there are people who don’t, so it makes it really hard to make general statements about substances when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own drawbacks. But no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes, because a lot of things they do are very traditional, like they've done the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics, and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian, my dad was an Episcopalian, but my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them like that. So, I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine says you should do things, but the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. \n\nI don't think that would necessarily influence it; I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. It's just a different realm; it might be an issue, but I probably don't think that would be the case. Well, I guess people who molest children would probably do that regardless of whether they were married or not, because it's a child, which is different from a spouse. So, if you're going to do something like that, you'd probably do it whether you're married or not. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening; I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",
            "I'm not quite sure about this matter, I haven't made a decision,\nSo I can't say which side is right or wrong,\nBut I think that's the trickiest topic we're dealing with today,\nBecause the separation of church and state \nThe topic of marriage is something very difficult to define without offending anyone.\nSo I don't know, I think,\nI think that all civil unions \nShouldn't marriage be looked at \nAnd \nDefined by the government in the sense \nSince it is considered a sacrament \nOne wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr \nBe looked at in a certain way by the government if one was baptized,\nAnd \nSo \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause \nThat's what it is \nTwo people \nThey shouldn't have a separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't go into the question of what kind of marriage it was \nTwo people who got united in a partnership,\nSo \nAnd \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat would just be \nTwo people who entered into a civil union \n\nSo \nIf all the states come to a logical conclusion, then they should try to make it federal law.\nBut \nA constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is just absurd.\nIt is \nSomething that shouldn't be changed in the constitution,\nI mean, it's a very big issue for certain people,\nBut \nIt's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment.\n\nIt's not important enough to change the constitution,\nTo define \nTo ban same-sex marriage \nSimply put.\n\nNo",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a gray area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends. So I think that I don’t necessarily agree with this lifestyle. But I think it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue. However, I believe it should be something that each state decides for itself, instead of the President deciding for the whole country. \n\nLike many states are democratic, and some states are Republican. Obviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think you should disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. Because you kind of chose to live there, you know. So I think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. So I think it should be up to the decision of each state. \n\nWell, I kind of already answered that.\n\nI just don’t think that President Bush should decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just think that I don’t think that President Bush doesn’t live in every single state. So he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to govern itself. I don’t know what to do. So I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. And also, he will be out of office in about two years. And if a Democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should just be up to the decision of each individual state. Because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the President. No, I don’t.",
            "I think that \nNo, I don't know if \nI think, that's how I figure it \nMySpace is a public thing \nAnd \nA message \nYou know, if you look at that definition \nI think, then \nYou know, that's basically meaning to post something for the public to see or others to see \nOr whatever you're trying to get at \nAnd \nNow if you post that on the internet \nI think, you have to realize that others will see it \nWhether it be school officials or not \nI think, that school officials seeing that \nThey had every right to see it \nBecause \nEven if they weren't posting it under the school's name \nThey could have still accessed that \nThrough their homes \nI think it's good to do something that saves lives \nBecause \nAs long as the lives of students are in danger \nI think that's the responsibility of the school system \nI think that's okay \nI think if they go on the internet to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing things they're not supposed to be doing \nThey go there specifically to catch students \nAnd \nTo get them in trouble \nAnd \nI think that's an invasion of privacy \nBut \nI think, if they save lives \nOr make the school a better and safer place \nI don't think that's an invasion at all \nI think it's okay if they do that \n\nYeah, I think I should elaborate more on that \n\nYeah, I think it's easier to \nExpress yourself \nWhen you're writing \nBut \n\nYeah, that's okay \nI think it's a public thing \nAnd if a student posts something on MySpace \nAnd \nIsn't expecting to get in trouble \nThat's ridiculous \nI think that's everything \nI'm worried about posting stuff, even through emails \nI think I wouldn't say anything negative about someone \nBecause \nI'm afraid someone will find it \nAnd \nYou know, everything \nEverything comes back \nAnd \nYou know, it bites you, I guess you could say \n\nI think if you do something as a college student, then you'll grow up to be an important person \nAnd they'll find an email you sent \nAnd \nIf it's on the internet, it's still on the internet \nAnd \nI think if you do that, there's no way to avoid it \nYou'll get in trouble \nAnd \nI don't think that's an invasion of privacy \nBecause \nI said before that \nAnd \nThat's basically what I've been saying \nIt's a public thing \nAnd \nI think that's okay \nI don't know what else to say \n\nI said before, I don't think they should go on the internet to catch students \nBut \nIf they have something that leads them to make the school a safer place \nI think that's okay \nOr \nOther officials like the police to go on \nI think when parents drop off their kids at school, they feel safe \nI've actually discussed that with a \nMy teacher \nI went to a public high school \nAnd \nThey say, \nWe have to ensure that \nLike we would do a lockdown \nAnd \nThings \nAnd \nThat's in reference to the terrorist attacks \nWe had lockdown drills \nAnd \nWe got used to it \nAnd \nI think that has nothing to do with the \nI mean it has something to do with the school shooting \nBecause \nI think that's in case someone breaks into the building \nI think we \nWe practiced that \nTo make the school a safer place \nAnd \nThat's what the school officials did \nThey made it a safer place \nThey prevented something bad from happening \nLike Columbine or something like that \nI think that's all I can say \n\nThat's it, I think",
            "Okay, initially I was for it because I was personally affected by 9/11. \nAlso, I was for going back and basically creating as much chaos as they did here. \nHowever, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences because it was such an emotional event. \nAnd we just went there without being prepared and without a plan. \nAnd I think that backfired on us. \nI don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. \nI don't think it achieved anything. \nI think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. \nI don't think our presence there is going to make a difference if they can't even get along with themselves. \nIt's unfortunate, but due to 9/11, I'm almost indifferent to what happens over there. \nI just don't care about those people. \nI just think they're not human sometimes. \nI don't know, they fight with each other and can't do anything themselves. \nSo, I really don't care. \nI don't know, we definitely went there unprepared. \nWe didn't know what to expect over there. \nIt's also bad because war is viewed very differently over there than it is here. \nThey're just savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're interested in improving their country. \nI just think they want us out of there. \nAnd I think that would be okay for us. \nI think we should just leave and that's it. \nI think we were just hyped up when we went there. \nI don't think we thought rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. \nI think we pretty much just went there seeking revenge and I think President Bush went there because the people wanted to go there because of 9/11. \nAlso, I think he took it upon himself to declare war on Iraq. \nBut at the time, I understand where he was coming from. \nWe really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, \"Let's rebuild and that's it.\" \nSo, I don't think we could have just left it. \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do in terms of creating order. \nI don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do. \nAnd I don't know, I just think they didn't have unity. \nThey didn't know what they were going in there for. \nSo, I think that would have helped us a lot more. \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. \nSo, that's what we created there. \nHonestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. \nHonestly, I think they're always going to be like that. \nAnd I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. \nIt's gone on for long enough. \nI don't think we're making enough progress. \nWe've made progress, but not enough to stay there. \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. \nAnd we can't stay there forever. \nSo, I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying there. \nNo, okay."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views on various issues seem outdated. Many people think the Catholic Church is losing influence because it's not very open to many things. They have strong views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can be a turn-off for some people. If they were to adapt to a newer way of thinking, they might not lose their following. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of how it views certain issues. The Catholic Church is against abortion, which can make it difficult for people who are pro-choice to be part of the community. The same goes for gay marriage and other similar issues. The Church's stance on these topics can be a major reason for people to leave. I don't see why priests can't be married or have female priests. The Church says that priests are \"married\" to God, but I don't think that's a valid reason for not allowing them to have a family life. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family life, so why can't priests?",
            "Personally, I'm not opposed to same-sex marriage. I think it's not a decision that people make consciously. So I think that gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really put much thought into the topic, but I think it's wrong to say that it's not okay.\n\nIt doesn't seem like they have a choice in how they are. I mean, I was born straight, and another person might be born gay. It doesn't seem like they make a conscious decision that they should be held responsible for.\n\nI think it's wrong for the federal government to get involved, as it's not a legal issue or a moral issue. I don't think these gay people should be put on a stage like they made a wrong decision or choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government really has any say in this matter. It's hard [laughs].\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, nor is it a moral concern. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interfere in people's lives, and they're just who they are. Gay people are who they were born to be, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn't a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's just different and there are so many different aspects that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin, heads will never be tails but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. A lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just, it's a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up on is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. If you're allowing someone a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. His take on gay marriage actually goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, a lot of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "First of all, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a medication is illegal, it doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. First of all, if we make it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a medication is illegal, it doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. It's not harmful. You know what I mean.\n\nYeah, first of all, I mean there are a lot of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, vicodin, percocet, that kind of thing, and those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial, and if you deny their benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should accept its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nFirst of all, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol, because marijuana, if you abuse it, it's... although if you abuse alcohol, it can lead to bad things too. First of all, I'd say no, you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once, because then it would be abused, but if you just... You have to remove the taboo surrounding marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly.\n\nUh, yeah, first of all, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But I mean, it's not that bad for you, it's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. First of all, I mean, if we get rid of the image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNo.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. \nI'm not as strict as I used to be. \nI know, even as I've grown older, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. \nAnd I would get cute little dresses. \nAnd matching shoes. \nAnd a matching purse. \nThat was what I always did. I went to a private school. \nAnd I would see my friends there on the weekends. \nAnd we would just go. \nBut now, as I've grown older, they've created like a youth mass. \nAnd they cut it down to 30 minutes. \nAnd people dress a lot more casually. \nEspecially in the summer people come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. \nYou have the families there who are just running late. \nSo I think it's become a lot more casual. \nEven at the morning masses, where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. \nThose are okay too. \nBut it's just a lot more casual than it used to be. \nAs for other things, \nThat's the biggest thing that I've noticed. \nThat's the church I know. \nI don't know the politics within the church and whatnot. \nBut yes, that's it. \n[OK, in regards to all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] \nI don't think these things could have been avoided. \nBecause \nThere are men who are married. \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles. \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction to young kids. \nSo \nI think even if you allowed them to get married, it's just the person, not because they're allowed to get married or not. \nI also think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. \nThere are religions that allow them to get married, where they could do so \nLike Seventh Heaven. \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something. \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey allow them to get married. \nSo \nI know it's a bit different. \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe think about a different faith. \n[OK, can you elaborate on your answer a bit more?] \nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nThe changes \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] \nOh, on pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nI think, \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality is before \nUm \nGenetics, I think it's based on genetics. \nI think people are born that way. \nI don't think it has anything to do with upbringing. \nIt might have a bit to do with this case \nBut \nI think it's their genetics. \nAnd \nYou can't hide that through a marriage. \nYou can try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out. \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. \nUm \nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them. \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew. \n[OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] \nUm no.",
            "(laughs) Initially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext; there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that the Bush administration early on connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq war just boils my blood. \n\nUm... It just seems to me that the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that, to me, is a form of malfeasance in office, I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution, and has been trying to marginalize it since September 11th at least, I mean. I think that they... Um... They came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nUm... That last part... I forget the name of the... Um... Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office... Um... But it seems to me that the younger Bush had a blood vendetta kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration, and I think that in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it’s gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war, and even more people would die as a result. Um... I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, coming in to try to restore order. But I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either, because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because... Um... Iraq’s sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue, there, because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Um... Oh, I can’t remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening in the country, and even Muktada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we’re still dealing with lots of radical elements that are vying for control of the government, and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm...

            "I don't know, I don't feel comfortable with it. It's not right that it's legalized or that a state even declares it legal. I think it's really up to the churches because in the constitution it says church and state are separated. It's clear, it's clear, I don't know. It's clearly stated and I think you should do anything to try to enforce any kind of power over it. Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution. So, in regards to the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think they are really picking one church over another. Because as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think it's really up to the state to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make legal. And legal.\n\nI don't know, well, the separation of church and state is almost a key aspect of the constitution, and what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States. And although they had planned on amending, I think even amending it would be completely wrong and in direct contradiction to what's already been said and written there. And I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that actually restricts the people rather than the government. So, I don't think it's right in that aspect.\n\nI don't know, no, I don't believe that the federal government or any government should get involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So, I really think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it I think by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\nMmm, not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay \nThe war in Iraq \nNow \nTo start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other

2003 \nAh \nI \nI myself am against the war and \nEspecially against a preemptive strike I was against that \nAh \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they made \n\nI mean \nA \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible and \nWhat they \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the country's government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nAh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nAh \nBecause there because there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to the end but again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is too much to continue risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue \nAnd this is where we get our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions was before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nAh \nI just hope that it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "I think we should see, I'm for gay marriage, I've always been. I really think it's a personal preference and it's something that's been proven more and more to be biological rather than sociological, instead of giving people fewer rights because of something they have no control over. I think it's quite inhumane and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think that politics and government in general should have anything to do with it, it's a personal matter, it's a household matter. I mean, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. I mean, they function just like any other family, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would and I think that Bush is trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, I think it's quite ridiculous.\n\nYeah, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from various different publications and TV reports or newspapers, it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be homosexual, as opposed to growing up with four sisters and being the only brother, and you know, not having a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side, as opposed to sociological.\n\nWell, other than the obvious, I think marriage is something that if a man and a woman want to do it, they can do it without telling a single person, run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's quite the type of thing that should be a personal, private, interpersonal matter, rather than in the public domain, in the national or federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "As an RA, I've already had to deal with this, when you put something on the internet, it becomes a public forum, it's completely public. You can't just post something that's going to color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there in the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get the bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin; someone went to the school and they had to act on it. They can't just let it sit there, then God forbid something happens and they could have prevented it. [Right] On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just mess around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. I apologize, I couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were certain things there that he may have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you post things into the public internet forum, there really is no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be befriending their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to their attention, then it's a completely different thing. Um, yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a fake Facebook or Myspace account and befriend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't befriend my residents because honestly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see it and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Um, not really.",
            "I think the war has been going on for too long. I think the purpose was good at first. To restore democracy in another country. But I think we've lost sight of that purpose and we're now maybe just doing it to prove we're some kind of superpower in the world. I think the original motivation, considering George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein, was questionable. So I think if the original purpose was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal matters involved, I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. I think we got our message across in the first couple of months after starting the war, I think that was a statement in itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year or several years, I just think it's gone on too long. \n\nYes, I think, I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. But I don't think our justification has been deteriorated and misleading over time. It seems like we're still at war just to be at war. And we don't want to come out of this thing without a clear end, without a victory or whatever. \n\nYes, I think it's been long enough and it should stop. I mean, there's a point in time when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We've been draining our own economy for too long, spending billions of dollars on wars on our own turf, such as poverty and whatnot, which we should be spending on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's been going on for too long. \n\nYes, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be a long-term goal in our budget. There are things like poverty or internal improvements, public roads or anything related to schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, which I think that money could be used better. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nI think that's it.",
            "I'd like to clarify a point that\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like that\n\nOkay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy, on platforms like Myspace if you post information on the internet it's almost like it's available to everyone. And I understand on Myspace, you know, in order to see someone's profile, you have to have someone else be a member, you have to add them as a friend or something like that, so if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it, you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you post information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think it was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's different profiles to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's just look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on the situation they came across that profile, or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just happened to see that, or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something, so I don't really know.\n\nYes, um, well, I mean, I personally don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook, I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just wanted to prove how easy it is to get information, and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away, and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I post, but at the same time, I think the whole point of having one is so you can communicate with some of your friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue, because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never really know who can see what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how the high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace, and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people what they could and couldn't do. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm, yeah, we only have this and then one more time to talk about the Iraq War. Yeah, I mean, I feel guilty talking about it, I mean, I hate to say, you know, that I was against it from the beginning, joining the bandwagon of people who are like, oh, I was against it from the start. I was, but it's not really important anymore, because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls, they've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and, I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops who are there, like the US troops who are there right now, think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in, it was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster, there's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states, I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration, or previous administrations, to understand, they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone is arguing that he isn't, but, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, just like quicksand when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them, I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that, but, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now, and like these, these are the people that we're trying to save, the people we're trying to help, telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that, and at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens, if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision to leave, and then you know at least we'll, I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we are now, where we stand.",
            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. And it's not just for women. I think it has to do with the specific field of work that one is in. I mean, in general, I feel that women have it harder because there's the \"glass ceiling\" where, even though it's supposed to be about equality, most people have a hard time finding someone to work under a woman if they're a man because the society has been raised for so long. And often, women in the workplace see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position because, historically, it's been shown that women are not usually in the upper levels of the business world. And I think the same thing goes for men. And in other fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really rare for a man to be at home. And often, people look down on that because society thinks, \"Oh, you're a man, you should be working. You should be the breadwinner of your family. Why are you staying at home?\" And it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has a better job, and it's working out fine for them. But society looks down on that. And in the fashion industry, often people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense. But I think it's because men who are typically into fashion... I think they have different lifestyles. And if a man has the typical lifestyle and is in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women? Like, you don't really know what our case is like? Like these other guys.\" And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of difficult because society has a fixed mindset and, obviously, we've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow. So, I think that if we continue to work at the pace we are now because women are advancing to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, but it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And similarly, as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, maybe the woman has a better job or she wants to be the one who works.\" And then for people in fashion, it'll be like, \"Oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and so they know where I'm coming from.\" So, I guess you have to kind of promote it by showing the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but showing the qualities of them. Because if you force it, people will resist. And I think we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So, I don't really know if there's anything we can do now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time. Yes. And I think they're also discriminated against each other, depending on the type of job you have or where you come from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't so good, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men will look down on you and be like, \"How do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, sometimes it's where you come from that discriminates against you, and from gender to gender. And I don't know, I think that would be another example. Not really.",
            "I mean they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it. But that made it from an offense to a traffic fine. You know what I mean, you get cited and you don’t have to get arrested and brought to jail and all that. But I think if someone gets caught and gets cited, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that. But there are arguments that it is expensive to arrest people and bring them in and to book them and then to let them go, and it costs a lot to bring them to court, maybe twice, maybe three times, and to appoint a public defender, and to pay the judge and the state attorney’s office has to take up the case and basically press the charges. I mean all these things cost a lot. And I mean if you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean many of them are philosophically not willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money. Like many communities are rightfully against marijuana and they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, to a certain extent, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for homeless people. But I think it’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want to have everywhere, all over the streets and stuff, but there’s a whole financial element to it as well, other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be that way. Well no, I mean I don’t know how I would feel about it, well if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, and I mean maybe a lot of people would say they’re smoking and driving, and it’s still a taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I find it awkward for a lot of people. But I think in general, alcohol has a much greater impact on your motor skills. But I think in general, marijuana has a more significant impact on people’s lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making skills. I mean but they both have their drawbacks. And I mean I think when it comes to substances in general, there are no two people who react the same way, I mean, and then there are people who have normal personalities and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then there are people who know how to exercise moderation, and then there are people who don’t, so it makes it really hard to make general statements about substances when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own drawbacks. But no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes, because a lot of things they do are very traditional, like they've done the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics, and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian, my dad was an Episcopalian, but my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them like that. So, I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine says you should do things, but the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. \n\nI don't think that would necessarily influence it; I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. It's just a different realm; it might be an issue, but I probably don't think that would be the case. Well, I guess people who molest children would probably do that regardless of whether they were married or not, because it's a child, which is different from a spouse. So, if you're going to do something like that, you'd probably do it whether you're married or not. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening; I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",
            "I'm not quite sure about this matter, I haven't made a decision,\nSo I can't say which side is right or wrong,\nBut I think that's the trickiest topic we're dealing with today,\nBecause the separation of church and state \nThe topic of marriage is something very difficult to define without offending anyone.\nSo I don't know, I think,\nI think that all civil unions \nShouldn't marriage be looked at \nAnd \nDefined by the government in the sense \nSince it is considered a sacrament \nOne wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr \nBe looked at in a certain way by the government if one was baptized,\nAnd \nSo \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause \nThat's what it is \nTwo people \nThey shouldn't have a separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't go into the question of what kind of marriage it was \nTwo people who got united in a partnership,\nSo \nAnd \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat would just be \nTwo people who entered into a civil union \n\nSo \nIf all the states come to a logical conclusion, then they should try to make it federal law.\nBut \nA constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is just absurd.\nIt is \nSomething that shouldn't be changed in the constitution,\nI mean, it's a very big issue for certain people,\nBut \nIt's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment.\n\nIt's not important enough to change the constitution,\nTo define \nTo ban same-sex marriage \nSimply put.\n\nNo",

However, I believe it should be something that each state decides for itself, instead of the President deciding for the whole country. \n\nLike many states are democratic, and some states are Republican. Obviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think you should disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. Because you kind of chose to live there, you know. So I think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. So I think it should be up to the decision of each state. \n\nWell, I kind of already answered that.\n\nI just don’t think that President Bush should decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just think that I don’t think that President Bush doesn’t live in every single state. So he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to govern itself. I don’t know what to do. So I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. And also, he will be out of office in about two years. And if a Democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should just be up to the decision of each individual state. Because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the President. No, I don’t.",
            "I think that \nNo, I don't know if \nI think, that's how I figure it \nMySpace is a public thing \nAnd \nA message \nYou know, if you look at that definition \nI think, then \nYou know, that's basically meaning to post something for the public to see or others to see \nOr whatever you're trying to get at \nAnd \nNow if you post that on the internet \nI think, you have to realize that others will see it \nWhether it be school officials or not \nI think, that school officials seeing that \nThey had every right to see it \nBecause \nEven if they weren't posting it under the school's name \nThey could have still accessed that \nThrough their homes \nI think it's good to do something that saves lives \nBecause \nAs long as the lives of students are in danger \nI think that's the responsibility of the school system \nI think that's okay \nI think if they go on the internet to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing things they're not supposed to be doing \nThey go there specifically to catch students \nAnd \nTo get them in trouble \nAnd \nI think that's an invasion of privacy \nBut \nI think, if they save lives \nOr make the school a better and safer place \nI don't think that's an invasion at all \nI think it's okay if they do that \n\nYeah, I think I should elaborate more on that \n\nYeah, I think it's easier to \nExpress yourself \nWhen you're writing \nBut \n\nYeah, that's okay \nI think it's a public thing \nAnd if a student posts something on MySpace \nAnd \nIsn't expecting to get in trouble \nThat's ridiculous \nI think that's everything \nI'm worried about posting stuff, even through emails \nI think I wouldn't say anything negative about someone \nBecause \nI'm afraid someone will find it \nAnd \nYou know, everything \nEverything comes back \nAnd \nYou know, it bites you, I guess you could say \n\nI think if you do something as a college student, then you'll grow up to be an important person \nAnd they'll find an email you sent \nAnd \nIf it's on the internet, it's still on the internet \nAnd \nI think if you do that, there's no way to avoid it \nYou'll get in trouble \nAnd \nI don't think that's an invasion of privacy \nBecause \nI said before that \nAnd \nThat's basically what I've been saying \nIt's a public thing \nAnd \nI think that's okay \nI don't know what else to say \n\nI said before, I don't think they should go on the internet to catch students \nBut \nIf they have something that leads them to make the school a safer place \nI think that's okay \nOr \nOther officials like the police to go on \nI think when parents drop off their kids at school, they feel safe \nI've actually discussed that with a \nMy teacher \nI went to a public high school \nAnd \nThey say, \nWe have to ensure that \nLike we would do a lockdown \nAnd \nThings \nAnd \nThat's in reference to the terrorist attacks \nWe had lockdown drills \nAnd \nWe got used to it \nAnd \nI think that has nothing to do with the \nI mean it has something to do with the school shooting \nBecause \nI think that's in case someone breaks into the building \nI think we \nWe practiced that \nTo make the school a safer place \nAnd \nThat's what the school officials did \nThey made it a safer place \nThey prevented something bad from happening \nLike Columbine or something like that \nI think that's all I can say \n\nThat's it, I think",
            "Okay, initially I was for it because I was personally affected by 9/11. \nAlso, I was for going back and basically creating as much chaos as they did here. \nHowever, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences because it was such an emotional event. \nAnd we just went there without being prepared and without a plan. \nAnd I think that backfired on us. \nI don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. \nI don't think it achieved anything. \nI think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. \nI don't think our presence there is going to make a difference if they can't even get along with themselves. \nIt's unfortunate, but due to 9/11, I'm almost indifferent to what happens over there. \nI just don't care about those people. \nI just think they're not human sometimes. \nI don't know, they fight with each other and can't do anything themselves. \nSo, I really don't care. \nI don't know, we definitely went there unprepared. \nWe didn't know what to expect over there. \nIt's also bad because war is viewed very differently over there than it is here. \nThey're just savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're interested in improving their country. \nI just think they want us out of there. \nAnd I think that would be okay for us. \nI think we should just leave and that's it. \nI think we were just hyped up when we went there. \nI don't think we thought rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. \nI think we pretty much just went there seeking revenge and I think President Bush went there because the people wanted to go there because of 9/11. \nAlso, I think he took it upon himself to declare war on Iraq. \nBut at the time, I understand where he was coming from. \nWe really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, \"Let's rebuild and that's it.\" \nSo, I don't think we could have just left it. \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do in terms of creating order. \nI don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do. \nAnd I don't know, I just think they didn't have unity. \nThey didn't know what they were going in there for. \nSo, I think that would have helped us a lot more. \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. \nSo, that's what we created there. \nHonestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. \nHonestly, I think they're always going to be like that. \nAnd I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. \nIt's gone on for long enough. \nI don't think we're making enough progress. \nWe've made progress, but not enough to stay there. \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. \nAnd we can't stay there forever. \nSo, I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying there. \nNo, okay."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views on various issues seem outdated. Many people think the Catholic Church is losing influence because it's not very open to many things. They have strong views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can be a turn-off for some people. If they were to adapt to a newer way of thinking, they might not lose their following. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of how it views certain issues. The Catholic Church is against abortion, which can make it difficult for people who are pro-choice to be part of the community. The same goes for gay marriage and other similar issues. The Church's stance on these topics can be a major reason for people to leave. I don't see why priests can't be married or have female priests. The Church says that priests are \"married\" to God, but I don't think that's a valid reason for not allowing them to have a family life. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family life, so why can't priests?",
            "Personally, I'm not opposed to same-sex marriage. I think it's not a decision that people make consciously. So I think that gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really put much thought into the topic, but I think it's wrong to say that it's not okay.\n\nIt doesn't seem like they have a choice in how they are. I mean, I was born straight, and another person might be born gay. It doesn't seem like they make a conscious decision that they should be held responsible for.\n\nI think it's wrong for the federal government to get involved, as it's not a legal issue or a moral issue. I don't think these gay people should be put on a stage like they made a wrong decision or choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government really has any say in this matter. It's hard [laughs].\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, nor is it a moral concern. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interfere in people's lives, and they're just who they are. Gay people are who they were born to be, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn't a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's just different and there are so many different aspects that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin, heads will never be tails but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. A lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just, it's a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up on is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. If you're allowing someone a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. His take on gay marriage actually goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, a lot of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "First of all, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a medication is illegal, it doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. First of all, if we make it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a medication is illegal, it doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. It's not harmful. You know what I mean.\n\nYeah, first of all, I mean there are a lot of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, vicodin, percocet, that kind of thing, and those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial, and if you deny their benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should accept its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nFirst of all, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol, because marijuana, if you abuse it, it's... although if you abuse alcohol, it can lead to bad things too. First of all, I'd say no, you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once, because then it would be abused, but if you just... You have to remove the taboo surrounding marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly.\n\nUh, yeah, first of all, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But I mean, it's not that bad for you, it's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. First of all, I mean, if we get rid of the image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNo.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. \nI'm not as strict as I used to be. \nI know, even as I've grown older, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. \nAnd I would get cute little dresses. \nAnd matching shoes. \nAnd a matching purse. \nThat was what I always did. I went to a private school. \nAnd I would see my friends there on the weekends. \nAnd we would just go. \nBut now, as I've grown older, they've created like a youth mass. \nAnd they cut it down to 30 minutes. \nAnd people dress a lot more casually. \nEspecially in the summer people come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. \nYou have the families there who are just running late. \nSo I think it's become a lot more casual. \nEven at the morning masses, where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. \nThose are okay too. \nBut it's just a lot more casual than it used to be. \nAs for other things, \nThat's the biggest thing that I've noticed. \nThat's the church I know. \nI don't know the politics within the church and whatnot. \nBut yes, that's it. \n[OK, in regards to all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] \nI don't think these things could have been avoided. \nBecause \nThere are men who are married. \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles. \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction to young kids. \nSo \nI think even if you allowed them to get married, it's just the person, not because they're allowed to get married or not. \nI also think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. \nThere are religions that allow them to get married, where they could do so \nLike Seventh Heaven. \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something. \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey allow them to get married. \nSo \nI know it's a bit different. \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe think about a different faith. \n[OK, can you elaborate on your answer a bit more?] \nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nThe changes \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] \nOh, on pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nI think, \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality is before \nUm \nGenetics, I think it's based on genetics. \nI think people are born that way. \nI don't think it has anything to do with upbringing. \nIt might have a bit to do with this case \nBut \nI think it's their genetics. \nAnd \nYou can't hide that through a marriage. \nYou can try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out. \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. \nUm \nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them. \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew. \n[OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] \nUm no.",
            "(laughs) Initially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext; there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that the Bush administration early on connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq war just boils my blood. \n\nUm... It just seems to me that the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that, to me, is a form of malfeasance in office, I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution, and has been trying to marginalize it since September 11th at least, I mean. I think that they... Um... They came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nUm... That last part... I forget the name of the... Um... Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office... Um... But it seems to me that the younger Bush had a blood vendetta kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration, and I think that in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it’s gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war, and even more people would die as a result. Um... I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, coming in to try to restore order. But I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either, because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because... Um... Iraq’s sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue, there, because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Um... Oh, I can’t remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening in the country, and even Muktada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we’re still dealing with lots of radical elements that are vying for control of the government, and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm...

            "I don't know, I don't feel comfortable with it. It's not right that it's legalized or that a state even declares it legal. I think it's really up to the churches because in the constitution it says church and state are separated. It's clear, it's clear, I don't know. It's clearly stated and I think you should do anything to try to enforce any kind of power over it. Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution. So, in regards to the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think they are really picking one church over another. Because as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think it's really up to the state to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make legal. And legal.\n\nI don't know, well, the separation of church and state is almost a key aspect of the constitution, and what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States. And although they had planned on amending, I think even amending it would be completely wrong and in direct contradiction to what's already been said and written there. And I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that actually restricts the people rather than the government. So, I don't think it's right in that aspect.\n\nI don't know, no, I don't believe that the federal government or any government should get involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So, I really think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it I think by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\nMmm, not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay \nThe war in Iraq \nNow \nTo start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other

2003 \nAh \nI \nI myself am against the war and \nEspecially against a preemptive strike I was against that \nAh \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they made \n\nI mean \nA \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible and \nWhat they \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the country's government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nAh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nAh \nBecause there because there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to the end but again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is too much to continue risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue \nAnd this is where we get our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions was before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nAh \nI just hope that it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "I think we should see, I'm for gay marriage, I've always been. I really think it's a personal preference and it's something that's been proven more and more to be biological rather than sociological, instead of giving people fewer rights because of something they have no control over. I think it's quite inhumane and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think that politics and government in general should have anything to do with it, it's a personal matter, it's a household matter. I mean, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. I mean, they function just like any other family, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would and I think that Bush is trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, I think it's quite ridiculous.\n\nYeah, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from various different publications and TV reports or newspapers, it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be homosexual, as opposed to growing up with four sisters and being the only brother, and you know, not having a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side, as opposed to sociological.\n\nWell, other than the obvious, I think marriage is something that if a man and a woman want to do it, they can do it without telling a single person, run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's quite the type of thing that should be a personal, private, interpersonal matter, rather than in the public domain, in the national or federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "As an RA, I've already had to deal with this, when you put something on the internet, it becomes a public forum, it's completely public. You can't just post something that's going to color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there in the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get the bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin; someone went to the school and they had to act on it. They can't just let it sit there, then God forbid something happens and they could have prevented it. [Right] On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just mess around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. I apologize, I couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were certain things there that he may have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you post things into the public internet forum, there really is no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be befriending their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to their attention, then it's a completely different thing. Um, yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a fake Facebook or Myspace account and befriend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't befriend my residents because honestly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see it and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Um, not really.",
            "I think the war has been going on for too long. I think the purpose was good at first. To restore democracy in another country. But I think we've lost sight of that purpose and we're now maybe just doing it to prove we're some kind of superpower in the world. I think the original motivation, considering George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein, was questionable. So I think if the original purpose was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal matters involved, I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. I think we got our message across in the first couple of months after starting the war, I think that was a statement in itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year or several years, I just think it's gone on too long. \n\nYes, I think, I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. But I don't think our justification has been deteriorated and misleading over time. It seems like we're still at war just to be at war. And we don't want to come out of this thing without a clear end, without a victory or whatever. \n\nYes, I think it's been long enough and it should stop. I mean, there's a point in time when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We've been draining our own economy for too long, spending billions of dollars on wars on our own turf, such as poverty and whatnot, which we should be spending on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's been going on for too long. \n\nYes, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be a long-term goal in our budget. There are things like poverty or internal improvements, public roads or anything related to schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, which I think that money could be used better. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nI think that's it.",
            "I'd like to clarify a point that\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like that\n\nOkay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy, on platforms like Myspace if you post information on the internet it's almost like it's available to everyone. And I understand on Myspace, you know, in order to see someone's profile, you have to have someone else be a member, you have to add them as a friend or something like that, so if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it, you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you post information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think it was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's different profiles to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's just look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on the situation they came across that profile, or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just happened to see that, or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something, so I don't really know.\n\nYes, um, well, I mean, I personally don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook, I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just wanted to prove how easy it is to get information, and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away, and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I post, but at the same time, I think the whole point of having one is so you can communicate with some of your friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue, because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never really know who can see what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how the high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace, and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people what they could and couldn't do. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm, yeah, we only have this and then one more time to talk about the Iraq War. Yeah, I mean, I feel guilty talking about it, I mean, I hate to say, you know, that I was against it from the beginning, joining the bandwagon of people who are like, oh, I was against it from the start. I was, but it's not really important anymore, because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls, they've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and, I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops who are there, like the US troops who are there right now, think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in, it was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster, there's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states, I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration, or previous administrations, to understand, they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone is arguing that he isn't, but, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, just like quicksand when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them, I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that, but, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now, and like these, these are the people that we're trying to save, the people we're trying to help, telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that, and at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens, if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision to leave, and then you know at least we'll, I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we are now, where we stand.",
            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. And it's not just for women. I think it has to do with the specific field of work that one is in. I mean, in general, I feel that women have it harder because there's the \"glass ceiling\" where, even though it's supposed to be about equality, most people have a hard time finding someone to work under a woman if they're a man because the society has been raised for so long. And often, women in the workplace see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position because, historically, it's been shown that women are not usually in the upper levels of the business world. And I think the same thing goes for men. And in other fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really rare for a man to be at home. And often, people look down on that because society thinks, \"Oh, you're a man, you should be working. You should be the breadwinner of your family. Why are you staying at home?\" And it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has a better job, and it's working out fine for them. But society looks down on that. And in the fashion industry, often people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense. But I think it's because men who are typically into fashion... I think they have different lifestyles. And if a man has the typical lifestyle and is in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women? Like, you don't really know what our case is like? Like these other guys.\" And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of difficult because society has a fixed mindset and, obviously, we've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow. So, I think that if we continue to work at the pace we are now because women are advancing to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, but it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And similarly, as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, maybe the woman has a better job or she wants to be the one who works.\" And then for people in fashion, it'll be like, \"Oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and so they know where I'm coming from.\" So, I guess you have to kind of promote it by showing the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but showing the qualities of them. Because if you force it, people will resist. And I think we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So, I don't really know if there's anything we can do now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time. Yes. And I think they're also discriminated against each other, depending on the type of job you have or where you come from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't so good, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men will look down on you and be like, \"How do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, sometimes it's where you come from that discriminates against you, and from gender to gender. And I don't know, I think that would be another example. Not really.",
            "I mean they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it. But that made it from an offense to a traffic fine. You know what I mean, you get cited and you don’t have to get arrested and brought to jail and all that. But I think if someone gets caught and gets cited, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that. But there are arguments that it is expensive to arrest people and bring them in and to book them and then to let them go, and it costs a lot to bring them to court, maybe twice, maybe three times, and to appoint a public defender, and to pay the judge and the state attorney’s office has to take up the case and basically press the charges. I mean all these things cost a lot. And I mean if you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean many of them are philosophically not willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money. Like many communities are rightfully against marijuana and they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, to a certain extent, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for homeless people. But I think it’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want to have everywhere, all over the streets and stuff, but there’s a whole financial element to it as well, other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be that way. Well no, I mean I don’t know how I would feel about it, well if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, and I mean maybe a lot of people would say they’re smoking and driving, and it’s still a taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I find it awkward for a lot of people. But I think in general, alcohol has a much greater impact on your motor skills. But I think in general, marijuana has a more significant impact on people’s lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making skills. I mean but they both have their drawbacks. And I mean I think when it comes to substances in general, there are no two people who react the same way, I mean, and then there are people who have normal personalities and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then there are people who know how to exercise moderation, and then there are people who don’t, so it makes it really hard to make general statements about substances when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own drawbacks. But no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes, because a lot of things they do are very traditional, like they've done the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics, and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian, my dad was an Episcopalian, but my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them like that. So, I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine says you should do things, but the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. \n\nI don't think that would necessarily influence it; I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. It's just a different realm; it might be an issue, but I probably don't think that would be the case. Well, I guess people who molest children would probably do that regardless of whether they were married or not, because it's a child, which is different from a spouse. So, if you're going to do something like that, you'd probably do it whether you're married or not. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening; I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",
            "I'm not quite sure about this matter, I haven't made a decision,\nSo I can't say which side is right or wrong,\nBut I think that's the trickiest topic we're dealing with today,\nBecause the separation of church and state \nThe topic of marriage is something very difficult to define without offending anyone.\nSo I don't know, I think,\nI think that all civil unions \nShouldn't marriage be looked at \nAnd \nDefined by the government in the sense \nSince it is considered a sacrament \nOne wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr \nBe looked at in a certain way by the government if one was baptized,\nAnd \nSo \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause \nThat's what it is \nTwo people \nThey shouldn't have a separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't go into the question of what kind of marriage it was \nTwo people who got united in a partnership,\nSo \nAnd \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat would just be \nTwo people who entered into a civil union \n\nSo \nIf all the states come to a logical conclusion, then they should try to make it federal law.\nBut \nA constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is just absurd.\nIt is \nSomething that shouldn't be changed in the constitution,\nI mean, it's a very big issue for certain people,\nBut \nIt's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment.\n\nIt's not important enough to change the constitution,\nTo define \nTo ban same-sex marriage \nSimply put.\n\nNo",

However, I believe it should be something that each state decides for itself, instead of the President deciding for the whole country. \n\nLike many states are democratic, and some states are Republican. Obviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think you should disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. Because you kind of chose to live there, you know. So I think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. So I think it should be up to the decision of each state. \n\nWell, I kind of already answered that.\n\nI just don’t think that President Bush should decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just think that I don’t think that President Bush doesn’t live in every single state. So he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to govern itself. I don’t know what to do. So I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. And also, he will be out of office in about two years. And if a Democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should just be up to the decision of each individual state. Because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the President. No, I don’t.",
            "I think that \nNo, I don't know if \nI think, that's how I figure it \nMySpace is a public thing \nAnd \nA message \nYou know, if you look at that definition \nI think, then \nYou know, that's basically meaning to post something for the public to see or others to see \nOr whatever you're trying to get at \nAnd \nNow if you post that on the internet \nI think, you have to realize that others will see it \nWhether it be school officials or not \nI think, that school officials seeing that \nThey had every right to see it \nBecause \nEven if they weren't posting it under the school's name \nThey could have still accessed that \nThrough their homes \nI think it's good to do something that saves lives \nBecause \nAs long as the lives of students are in danger \nI think that's the responsibility of the school system \nI think that's okay \nI think if they go on the internet to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing things they're not supposed to be doing \nThey go there specifically to catch students \nAnd \nTo get them in trouble \nAnd \nI think that's an invasion of privacy \nBut \nI think, if they save lives \nOr make the school a better and safer place \nI don't think that's an invasion at all \nI think it's okay if they do that \n\nYeah, I think I should elaborate more on that \n\nYeah, I think it's easier to \nExpress yourself \nWhen you're writing \nBut \n\nYeah, that's okay \nI think it's a public thing \nAnd if a student posts something on MySpace \nAnd \nIsn't expecting to get in trouble \nThat's ridiculous \nI think that's everything \nI'm worried about posting stuff, even through emails \nI think I wouldn't say anything negative about someone \nBecause \nI'm afraid someone will find it \nAnd \nYou know, everything \nEverything comes back \nAnd \nYou know, it bites you, I guess you could say \n\nI think if you do something as a college student, then you'll grow up to be an important person \nAnd they'll find an email you sent \nAnd \nIf it's on the internet, it's still on the internet \nAnd \nI think if you do that, there's no way to avoid it \nYou'll get in trouble \nAnd \nI don't think that's an invasion of privacy \nBecause \nI said before that \nAnd \nThat's basically what I've been saying \nIt's a public thing \nAnd \nI think that's okay \nI don't know what else to say \n\nI said before, I don't think they should go on the internet to catch students \nBut \nIf they have something that leads them to make the school a safer place \nI think that's okay \nOr \nOther officials like the police to go on \nI think when parents drop off their kids at school, they feel safe \nI've actually discussed that with a \nMy teacher \nI went to a public high school \nAnd \nThey say, \nWe have to ensure that \nLike we would do a lockdown \nAnd \nThings \nAnd \nThat's in reference to the terrorist attacks \nWe had lockdown drills \nAnd \nWe got used to it \nAnd \nI think that has nothing to do with the \nI mean it has something to do with the school shooting \nBecause \nI think that's in case someone breaks into the building \nI think we \nWe practiced that \nTo make the school a safer place \nAnd \nThat's what the school officials did \nThey made it a safer place \nThey prevented something bad from happening \nLike Columbine or something like that \nI think that's all I can say \n\nThat's it, I think",
            "Okay, initially I was for it because I was personally affected by 9/11. \nAlso, I was for going back and basically creating as much chaos as they did here. \nHowever, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences because it was such an emotional event. \nAnd we just went there without being prepared and without a plan. \nAnd I think that backfired on us. \nI don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. \nI don't think it achieved anything. \nI think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. \nI don't think our presence there is going to make a difference if they can't even get along with themselves. \nIt's unfortunate, but due to 9/11, I'm almost indifferent to what happens over there. \nI just don't care about those people. \nI just think they're not human sometimes. \nI don't know, they fight with each other and can't do anything themselves. \nSo, I really don't care. \nI don't know, we definitely went there unprepared. \nWe didn't know what to expect over there. \nIt's also bad because war is viewed very differently over there than it is here. \nThey're just savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're interested in improving their country. \nI just think they want us out of there. \nAnd I think that would be okay for us. \nI think we should just leave and that's it. \nI think we were just hyped up when we went there. \nI don't think we thought rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. \nI think we pretty much just went there seeking revenge and I think President Bush went there because the people wanted to go there because of 9/11. \nAlso, I think he took it upon himself to declare war on Iraq. \nBut at the time, I understand where he was coming from. \nWe really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, \"Let's rebuild and that's it.\" \nSo, I don't think we could have just left it. \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do in terms of creating order. \nI don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do. \nAnd I don't know, I just think they didn't have unity. \nThey didn't know what they were going in there for. \nSo, I think that would have helped us a lot more. \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. \nSo, that's what we created there. \nHonestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. \nHonestly, I think they're always going to be like that. \nAnd I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. \nIt's gone on for long enough. \nI don't think we're making enough progress. \nWe've made progress, but not enough to stay there. \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. \nAnd we can't stay there forever. \nSo, I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying there. \nNo, okay."
