            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views are a bit old-fashioned. They have strong opinions on many things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. I think this is one of the reasons why the Catholic Church is losing followers. They are not very open to many things. \n\nI think if they were to adapt a bit, they wouldn't lose as many followers. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because they don't share their views. They think the Catholic Church has the wrong views. If you're for abortion, for example, you might not feel comfortable in a community that believes abortion is wrong. The same goes for gay marriage and other things. If you believe the Catholic Church is wrong, you might not be able to join a community that upholds these views. I think there's no reason why priests can't get married or why there can't be female priests. But I'm not sure if that would have made a difference. \n\nIf priests got married or there were female priests, it might not have made a difference. It's hard to say if they would have acted differently. I think there's no reason why priests can't get married. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God, but I don't think that's the same as a marriage. Everyone has a job and a family and other people they love. Why shouldn't that be the same for priests?",
            "I personally don't oppose men getting married. I think one doesn't consciously decide whether to be gay or not. I think you shouldn't be held responsible for who you are. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this much thought, but I think it's wrong for them to say that. \n\nIt seems to me that it's not like a choice whether you're gay or not. I mean, you're either gay or straight, and that's something you can't actively choose. It's like being born gay or not, and I think it's wrong to hold someone responsible for their sexual orientation. \n\nI think the federal government shouldn't interfere because it's not a legal or moral issue. I mean, you should just accept who you are and not try to change someone. It's tough to exclude the federal government, but I think they shouldn't interfere because it's not their business. \n\nIt's hard to exclude them, but I think they shouldn't interfere because it's not their thing. It's not about national security or moral concerns, it's just that they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have the right to interfere in people's lives. And you know, that's who they are, the gay people, that's just how they were born, at least that's what I think, and I mean they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn’t a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but they are just different. It’s like two different sides of the same coin, and heads will never be tails, but it’s the same thing. There are many civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and healthcare, where your primary or next of kin can’t visit because they aren’t technically family. It’s silly to spend the rest of your life with someone but not be able to have them in the room with you if you’re sick. Many scientific studies have been done and they show that homosexual couples have the same success rates and the same factors that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It’s just a relationship, it’s the same thing. Where people get hung up is that homosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church, they’re asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no involvement with church and state, then it shouldn’t be an issue. The Catholic church can believe whatever they want, but it shouldn’t be an issue in a legal sense. If you’re allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It’s like segregation, separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the roles played by different partners and so on. People are worried about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. They are especially worried about children of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society, but it’s hard to say. The main drawback to adoption is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. In New York City, they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools, kids get bullied and beat up, and parents protest to get them removed from school. It’s just a kid, they have the same points of view and everything, and parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. They can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But President Bush has very strong views related to his religion. His views on gay marriage go along with his views on abortion and stem cell research, and most of the reasons I’ve heard are moral reasons. Morality is not always negotiable, but it differs from person to person. It’s not fair to embrace the morality of one group in America while ignoring the culture and morality of the rest. It’s not fair to go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the whole country. It’s hypocritical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage considering the recent controversy over “under God” in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are opposed to that but will let laws be made that enforce religious standards on the whole country. Many people are against gay people and gay marriage because they believe they are somehow psychologically damaged. The American Psychological Association has just put out a memo saying that is untrue. If people listened to institutions that actually do research and studies on these subjects instead of their neighbors and friends, and maybe what’s popular opinion in their culture and church, then the world would be seen a little bit differently. No.",

            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. I understand that it's not as strict as it used to be. I know, even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would wear cute little dresses. And I would wear matching shoes. And I would wear a matching purse. That was the case when I went to a private school. And I would see all my friends on the weekends. And we would just go. But now, as I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass. And they cut it down to 30 minutes. And people dress a lot more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes, straight from the beach. You'd have families there who are just running late. So I think it's become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. People are wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just a lot more casual compared to that. What I've noticed is that that's the biggest thing that's changed. That's the church I know. I don't know the politics of the church and whatnot. But yeah, that's it. [OK, what exactly do you have to say about the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia?] I don't think these things could have been prevented. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. I think even if you let them get married, it's just the person. It's not because they're allowed to get married or not. I also think that when they become a priest, it's their decision. There are religions where they're allowed to get married. For example, on Seventh Heaven. I don't know what kind of [a reverend or a minister or something]. [mm hmm] But they're allowed to get married. I know it's a little different. If they really want to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe choose a different faith. [OK, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, about the changes. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, pedophilia. [Mm hmm] I think like the whole thing, sexual attraction before, as if it were genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I don't think people become it. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with upbringing. It might have something to do a little bit in this case, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through a marriage. You could try, but then it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, but I don't think in all cases they knew. [OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] No",
            "I was initially okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still pretty much reeling from the 9/11 attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that the Bush administration was quick to connect the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general the Iraq war really boils my blood. I was initially for the Iraq war, but now I think it was a bad idea to think that we would find WMDs in Iraq. I think that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, I mean, after he came back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that is a perversion of the constitution, I think that is an impeachable offense because they lied to the American people. I think that the Bush administration completely disregards the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since September 11. Honestly, I think they had the intention to go to war from the start. I think they went into Iraq to secure their energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. I think it's gone on long enough, but I also think that if we withdraw now, there's a good chance that the country will plunge into civil war and even more people will die as a result. I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving towards now seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to try to restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea because I think it will also cause more problems in the long term because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major point of contention. I think the interim government is dissolving because it's not effective. I've heard that the parliament is not very effective and that the Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process or what's happening. And also Mugtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I think it was less than a year ago, his party now has at least 20 seats in the Iraqi parliament and I think we're still dealing with radical elements that are vying for control of the government. I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. I can't discuss this in polite company.",
            "I was thinking \nI mean, let's just talk about this? \nOkay, cool \nUh-huh \nUh \nOkay, sorry \nOkay \nHow do I feel about the war in Iraq? \nLet me see \nUh \nAt this point, I feel like it's kind of pointless because it's not even officially declared as a war \nAnd I think it was just a big revenge thing against Iraq because we thought they were the ones who bombed the U.S. \nYou know, like the 9/11 attacks \nSo I don't feel like \nI mean, I'm not a big fan of the war in Iraq \nSo I don't really keep up with it \nI don't know the big details of it \nBut at this point, I know we're just going to stay there and try to build democracy so it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd also so we can get oil and resources from them \nBut that's not a good reason to stay there because it's causing a lot of resentment \nSo \nAnd then, if we stay there, it's going to end up with us trying to build democracy, which is going to take forever because democracy can't be built in a day \nAnd then if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUh \nLet me think \nOh, this is so difficult \nThis is the one topic I don't know anything about \nUh \nWar in Iraq \nOh, this is hard \nUh \nMmm \nI don't know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOkay \nThanks \nUh \nWell, actually \nI think \nI think the war should continue because it's not fair \nI don't think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I think \nYou know \nI think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore \nBecause we didn't even declare it \nI think that's how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by Congress \nAnd then it's \nI just don't think it's a big deal to stay there and try to help them \nBut it's also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like \nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of what it's doing and it's like \nAnd what it's doing to \nRemember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nThe Vietnam War was an undeclared war and it's now considered a meaningless war \nAnd he's like saying \nHe'll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nDoesn't this have to be a half an hour? \nUh \nOkay, yeah \nUh \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to continue because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are just killing each other because of different beliefs \nBut then again \nIt's like \nIt's hard to say \nI want them to be there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there, we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nIt's going to be even worse for them \nAnd it's going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Qaeda thing is just going to get even bigger and their hatred towards the U.S. is just going to get even bigger because we're now trying to change them \nAnd they've been going on this whole totalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it's going to \nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat's it \nOkay",
            "I don't see how it would be right to make it constitutionally legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal because I think it's up to the churches, as it's even stated in the constitution, separation of church and state. It's clear that trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be in direct contradiction to what has already been said and written in the constitution. In terms of the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really just choosing one church's belief over another because most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas. I don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal. The decision of what's legal or illegal should be left up to the churches. Separation of church and state is basically a key aspect of the constitution and what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Although they thought about proposing an amendment, I think even proposing an amendment about it would be completely wrong and in direct contradiction to what's already been said and written there. I also think that it would be one of the few amendments that actually restricts the people rather than the government. So, I don't think that's right. No, I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic, and as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion. So I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular, and there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it, I think, by I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nWell, \nTo start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUh \nAnd I think that it's \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear, clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUh \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with a country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUh \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short, successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was a lot of tension and there was a civil war and \nUh \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUh \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell, that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUh \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is it too much to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue \nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions was before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nUh \nI just hope that it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I think I'm for gay marriage, I've always been. I really think it's a personal preference and it's something that's been proven more and more now that it's biological rather than sociological, so to give people less rights due to something that's really not under their control. I think it's kinda inhumane and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think there's any role for politics and government in this; it's not even at a state level, it's a personal level, a family level. I know two or three openly gay couples in my neighborhood who aren't married or anything because they're not allowed to, but they function the same way as any other family would. They walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to is kinda ridiculous.\n\nYeah, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different publications and TV reports or newspapers that it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain, something you might be predisposed to be gay. As opposed to growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know you don't have anything to do with it, so that would be the biological side rather than sociological.\n\nWell, other than the obvious, I think maybe because marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it they can do it without telling a single person, just run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it'll make the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it should be a personal, private, matter rather than a public and national issue.\n\nNo, no.",

            "I think the war has been going on for too long, I think the purpose in the beginning was good. To restore democracy in another country is a good purpose. But I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose and we're now maybe just doing it because we're doing it to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I also think the original motivations were questionable because of George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \n\nSo, I think if the original motivation was to give democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, if there were personal matters involved I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. I think we got our purpose across in the first couple of months just starting the war, I think that was a statement in and of itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too long.\n\nYeah, I think. I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think our reason over time has been deteriorated and misconceived. It seems like we're still at war just to go to war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive end, a victory or whatever.\n\nYeah, I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway, and I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf, like poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out.\n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our budget for the long term. There are obvious things like poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that, healthcare, that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for.",
            "Can I ask a question clarifying that it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like that\n\nO k, umm, no I don't think that's an invasion of privacy on sites such as Myspace if I mean if you post information on the internet it's pretty much available for everyone to see and I understand on Myspace you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile you might need to be their friend or something like that but if that's the case you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it you're giving them permission to see your profile so I mean anytime you put information on the internet you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that so if I think that was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think O let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything um I mean I don't think it would really be right to go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something so I don't really know\n\nYeah, um well, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook I do it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me and I saw something on TV once that was about this this man who just he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me and it's hard because you think that they know your interests they know what you look like sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day who your friends are they pretty much know a lot about you all sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends I don't want to limit it too much so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know I mean you never really know who can look at what so\n\nHum, uh, well I heard my roommate was telling me that her um high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that's the only other thought I can think of \n\nYes",

I mean, I hate to say you know, I hate joining the bandwagon of people who say I was against it from the beginning. Yeah, I was, but it's not really important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now, think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states, I mean, it's just too big a gap for this administration or previous administrations to understand. And they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that totally different people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's arguing that he wasn't, but, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them, I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that, but, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago, that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these people that we're trying to save, these people that we're trying to help, are telling us to leave. Yeah, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. If it completely goes to hell, we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we'll, I mean if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the US. \n\nNot just for women, I think it has to do with the specific field of work you're in. \n\nI mean, overall, I think women have it harder because of the \"glass ceiling\" where even with equal opportunities, most people have a hard time finding someone who works under a woman if they're a man. \n\nBecause society has been built this way for so long. \n\nAnd often in the workplace, women see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position just because historically, it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. \n\nAnd, I think the same goes for men. \n\nIn certain industries like fashion or raising children at home, it's really uncommon for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. \n\nAnd often, people will look down on them because society thinks, \"Well, you're a man, you should be working and making money, why are you staying at home?\" \n\nAnd it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and the woman has a better job. \n\nAnd it's working out fine for them, but society looks down on it. \n\nIn the fashion industry, it's often the case that people won't take straight men seriously who are interested in fashion. \n\nI don't know if that makes sense, but I think it's because men who are interested in fashion often have a different lifestyle. \n\nSo if you have a typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women, like you don't really know what our case is like, like the other guys.\" \n\nAnd depending on the field of work you're in, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the US. \n\nIt's hard to change because society has a set mindset, and we've made huge progress since the 1800s, but it's a slow process. \n\nIf we continue at the same rate because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, it's a long process. \n\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. \n\nAnd just like men who stay at home to raise their children, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh wait, maybe the woman has the better job or she wants to be the one working.\" \n\nAnd in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Oh wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or wives and stuff, so they do know where I'm coming from.\" \n\nSo maybe you have to promote it by showing the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against without being too pushy. \n\nIf you force it, people will resist. \n\nAnd I think we're in a good balance where it's starting to permeate that way. \n\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist. \n\nAnd we've made progress, and change takes time. \n\nYes, and... \n\nThere is also discrimination between genders, depending on the field of work you're in or where you're from. \n\nIf you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't that great, but you're extremely intelligent and you worked your way up to a CEO position, other men will look down on you because they'll say, \"I don't know if you really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right.\" \n\nSo it's sometimes like where you're from discriminates against you. \n\nAnd between genders. \n\nI don't know, I think that would be another example.",
            "I mean they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nAh \nThat knocked it down from a crime to like a traffic violation \nYou know it’s a crime you get punished for, but you don’t get arrested and taken to jail \nAh \nI think if someone gets caught and gets punished then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nI don’t think the negative consequences go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut there’s an argument that \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest someone and take them to a cell and book them and then let them go and then bring them to court maybe two times maybe three \nAnd then hire a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press charges \nI mean all these things cost a lot of money \nAnd I mean \nWhen you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble I mean a lot of them aren’t philosophically willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open-minded \nI have to use the word liberal \nI understand what I mean \nA kind of way of thinking \nThen I think it’s fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on social programs for seniors and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for homeless people \nAh \nI think it’s \nIt’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you want just lying around everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole financial aspect to it as well \nOther reasons why it shouldn’t be done \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel if it were completely legal \nI mean you could sell it like cigarettes in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be smoking and driving \nAnd it’s still taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nAh \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI think it would be uncomfortable for a lot of people \nAh \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is a bit low \nAh \nI don’t really know \nAh \nI think alcohol has more of a negative effect on your ability to drive \nAh \nI think marijuana has a more negative effect on a person’s lifestyle \nIn comparison to their decision making and control \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their negative effects \nAnd I mean when it comes to substances in general \nIt seems like no two people react the same \nI mean and some people have normal personalities and they just do everything they have \nAnd then there are people who can control themselves and then there are people who can’t \nSo \nI think it’s hard to make general statements about the substance when people react differently \nBut I do think they both have their negative effects \nAh \nYeah \nAh \nNo I don’t",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they've done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt's good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it's also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI think \nMany Catholics believe they have to go to Church every Sunday \nAnd \nUm \nThey're very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don't accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI'm sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad's religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat's not really \nLike \nTo say to love others and then not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI think a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it's so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don't think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don't think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nBecause it's just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don't think that that would be an issue \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it's a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you're going to do something like that \nYou're probably going to do it whether or not you're married \nLike \nI don't think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope",
            "I'm not sure, I haven't made up my mind on this matter yet. So I can't say if one side is right or wrong. But I believe this is the most complicated aspect we're facing today. Because there's something delicate about the separation of church and state. And defining marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending anyone. So I don't know, I think. I think that all civil unions are something that I don't know if marriage should be looked at as. And like defined by the government, since it's considered a sacrament. Well, people wouldn't get tax breaks or looked at any differently by the government if they were baptized. And so if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is. It's two people, they shouldn't have a separation of church and state, they shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was. Two people got united. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, that would just be two people who got a civil union. \n\nWell, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just absurd. It is something like the constitution shouldn't just be amended because it's a big issue for certain people. I mean it's a very big topic for some people. But it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Simply put. Uh no",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a gray area for me. \n\nBecause I have a lot of gay friends. \n\nI think that I don’t necessarily agree with that lifestyle. \n\nBut I think that it should be legalized. \n\nI don’t think it should be a national issue. \n\nHowever I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than something the president decides for the entire country. \n\nWell, like many states are democratic, so many also have republican governments. \n\nObviously democratic states are going to vote for gay marriage. \n\nAnd if you live in a democratic state, you already know how that state feels about that position. \n\nI don’t think you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. \n\nBecause you’ve already chosen to live there. \n\nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals. \n\nSo I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. \n\nWell I kind of already said that. \n\nNow, I don’t think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. \n\nI think it should be up to each individual state as to whether they want to legalize it. \n\nI don’t agree with his stance against gay marriage. \n\nI just think some things should be left up to each individual state. \n\nPlus he’s going to be out of office in about two years. \n\nAnd if a democratic president decides he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it’s just going to go back and forth. \n\nIt should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are going to have to live with that decision, not the president. \n\nNo I don’t.",
            "I mean, no, I don't think so. I mean, let's see how I look at it. MySpace is a public thing, and a bulletin, you know? If you look at that definition, then you know that's basically to post for the public to see or for others to see. Whatever you're trying to get at, and now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it's school officials or not. So in my opinion, I think that school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But yeah, to prevent a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. I mean, let me see here. Like, if they go on to the internet, like on MySpace, just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble, and I think that's an invasion of privacy. But I think as long as they save lives, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. I mean, should I elaborate more on that? Yeah, I mean, okay, well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. But in order for them to express themselves, they need to be able to write.\n\nIn order for me to express myself, I'd rather write. Alright, well, like what I was saying, it's a public thing, and with a student posting something on MySpace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. I mean, everything, like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails. Like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that in an email because I'm afraid someone will pick it up and... you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, you know? If you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll find an email you sent somehow, and once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't think that's an invasion of privacy at all because, like I said before, it's a public thing. And well, that's basically all I've been saying, that it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here. Like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I think that's perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on. You know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like they're dropping them off at a safe place, and I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because we would do like lockdowns and stuff and... that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because, you know, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess. So we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. No, that's it.",
            "Okay, let's talk about war. At first, I was all for it because I was personally affected by 9/11. I was for going over there and causing as much chaos as they caused here. I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. We went there without a plan and were unprepared. I think that ultimately backfired on us. I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think we accomplished anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us as well. Like, I don't think us being there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. Unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've almost lost all feelings for what's going on over there. I just don't care about them. I don't think they're human, I don't know. They're just fighting with each other and can't get anything done, so I really don't care. We went over there completely unprepared, we didn't know what we were going to face over there. It's also bad because war is different for them than it is for us. They're like savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're looking to better their country, I think they're just looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. We were just hyped up, I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. We pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. But also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. At the time, I see where he was coming from, we really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, 'Okay, let's rebuild and that's it.' So, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order. I don't know, I just think that they didn't have any unity, they didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made progress, but not enough to stay in there. And I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. And we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views are a bit old-fashioned. They have strong opinions on many things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. I think this is one of the reasons why the Catholic Church is losing followers. They are not very open to many things. \n\nI think if they were to adapt a bit, they wouldn't lose as many followers. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because they don't share their views. They think the Catholic Church has the wrong views. If you're for abortion, for example, you might not feel comfortable in a community that believes abortion is wrong. The same goes for gay marriage and other things. If you believe the Catholic Church is wrong, you might not be able to join a community that upholds these views. I think there's no reason why priests can't get married or why there can't be female priests. But I'm not sure if that would have made a difference. \n\nIf priests got married or there were female priests, it might not have made a difference. It's hard to say if they would have acted differently. I think there's no reason why priests can't get married. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God, but I don't think that's the same as a marriage. Everyone has a job and a family and other people they love. Why shouldn't that be the same for priests?",
            "I personally don't oppose men getting married. I think one doesn't consciously decide whether to be gay or not. I think you shouldn't be held responsible for who you are. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this much thought, but I think it's wrong for them to say that. \n\nIt seems to me that it's not like a choice whether you're gay or not. I mean, you're either gay or straight, and that's something you can't actively choose. It's like being born gay or not, and I think it's wrong to hold someone responsible for their sexual orientation. \n\nI think the federal government shouldn't interfere because it's not a legal or moral issue. I mean, you should just accept who you are and not try to change someone. It's tough to exclude the federal government, but I think they shouldn't interfere because it's not their business. \n\nIt's hard to exclude them, but I think they shouldn't interfere because it's not their thing. It's not about national security or moral concerns, it's just that they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have the right to interfere in people's lives. And you know, that's who they are, the gay people, that's just how they were born, at least that's what I think, and I mean they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn’t a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but they are just different. It’s like two different sides of the same coin, and heads will never be tails, but it’s the same thing. There are many civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and healthcare, where your primary or next of kin can’t visit because they aren’t technically family. It’s silly to spend the rest of your life with someone but not be able to have them in the room with you if you’re sick. Many scientific studies have been done and they show that homosexual couples have the same success rates and the same factors that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It’s just a relationship, it’s the same thing. Where people get hung up is that homosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church, they’re asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no involvement with church and state, then it shouldn’t be an issue. The Catholic church can believe whatever they want, but it shouldn’t be an issue in a legal sense. If you’re allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It’s like segregation, separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the roles played by different partners and so on. People are worried about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. They are especially worried about children of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society, but it’s hard to say. The main drawback to adoption is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. In New York City, they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools, kids get bullied and beat up, and parents protest to get them removed from school. It’s just a kid, they have the same points of view and everything, and parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. They can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But President Bush has very strong views related to his religion. His views on gay marriage go along with his views on abortion and stem cell research, and most of the reasons I’ve heard are moral reasons. Morality is not always negotiable, but it differs from person to person. It’s not fair to embrace the morality of one group in America while ignoring the culture and morality of the rest. It’s not fair to go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the whole country. It’s hypocritical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage considering the recent controversy over “under God” in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are opposed to that but will let laws be made that enforce religious standards on the whole country. Many people are against gay people and gay marriage because they believe they are somehow psychologically damaged. The American Psychological Association has just put out a memo saying that is untrue. If people listened to institutions that actually do research and studies on these subjects instead of their neighbors and friends, and maybe what’s popular opinion in their culture and church, then the world would be seen a little bit differently. No.",

            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. I understand that it's not as strict as it used to be. I know, even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would wear cute little dresses. And I would wear matching shoes. And I would wear a matching purse. That was the case when I went to a private school. And I would see all my friends on the weekends. And we would just go. But now, as I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass. And they cut it down to 30 minutes. And people dress a lot more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes, straight from the beach. You'd have families there who are just running late. So I think it's become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. People are wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just a lot more casual compared to that. What I've noticed is that that's the biggest thing that's changed. That's the church I know. I don't know the politics of the church and whatnot. But yeah, that's it. [OK, what exactly do you have to say about the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia?] I don't think these things could have been prevented. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. I think even if you let them get married, it's just the person. It's not because they're allowed to get married or not. I also think that when they become a priest, it's their decision. There are religions where they're allowed to get married. For example, on Seventh Heaven. I don't know what kind of [a reverend or a minister or something]. [mm hmm] But they're allowed to get married. I know it's a little different. If they really want to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe choose a different faith. [OK, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, about the changes. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, pedophilia. [Mm hmm] I think like the whole thing, sexual attraction before, as if it were genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I don't think people become it. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with upbringing. It might have something to do a little bit in this case, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through a marriage. You could try, but then it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, but I don't think in all cases they knew. [OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] No",
            "I was initially okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still pretty much reeling from the 9/11 attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that the Bush administration was quick to connect the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general the Iraq war really boils my blood. I was initially for the Iraq war, but now I think it was a bad idea to think that we would find WMDs in Iraq. I think that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, I mean, after he came back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that is a perversion of the constitution, I think that is an impeachable offense because they lied to the American people. I think that the Bush administration completely disregards the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since September 11. Honestly, I think they had the intention to go to war from the start. I think they went into Iraq to secure their energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. I think it's gone on long enough, but I also think that if we withdraw now, there's a good chance that the country will plunge into civil war and even more people will die as a result. I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving towards now seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to try to restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea because I think it will also cause more problems in the long term because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major point of contention. I think the interim government is dissolving because it's not effective. I've heard that the parliament is not very effective and that the Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process or what's happening. And also Mugtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I think it was less than a year ago, his party now has at least 20 seats in the Iraqi parliament and I think we're still dealing with radical elements that are vying for control of the government. I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. I can't discuss this in polite company.",
            "I was thinking \nI mean, let's just talk about this? \nOkay, cool \nUh-huh \nUh \nOkay, sorry \nOkay \nHow do I feel about the war in Iraq? \nLet me see \nUh \nAt this point, I feel like it's kind of pointless because it's not even officially declared as a war \nAnd I think it was just a big revenge thing against Iraq because we thought they were the ones who bombed the U.S. \nYou know, like the 9/11 attacks \nSo I don't feel like \nI mean, I'm not a big fan of the war in Iraq \nSo I don't really keep up with it \nI don't know the big details of it \nBut at this point, I know we're just going to stay there and try to build democracy so it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd also so we can get oil and resources from them \nBut that's not a good reason to stay there because it's causing a lot of resentment \nSo \nAnd then, if we stay there, it's going to end up with us trying to build democracy, which is going to take forever because democracy can't be built in a day \nAnd then if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUh \nLet me think \nOh, this is so difficult \nThis is the one topic I don't know anything about \nUh \nWar in Iraq \nOh, this is hard \nUh \nMmm \nI don't know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOkay \nThanks \nUh \nWell, actually \nI think \nI think the war should continue because it's not fair \nI don't think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I think \nYou know \nI think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore \nBecause we didn't even declare it \nI think that's how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by Congress \nAnd then it's \nI just don't think it's a big deal to stay there and try to help them \nBut it's also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like \nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of what it's doing and it's like \nAnd what it's doing to \nRemember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nThe Vietnam War was an undeclared war and it's now considered a meaningless war \nAnd he's like saying \nHe'll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nDoesn't this have to be a half an hour? \nUh \nOkay, yeah \nUh \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to continue because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are just killing each other because of different beliefs \nBut then again \nIt's like \nIt's hard to say \nI want them to be there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there, we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nIt's going to be even worse for them \nAnd it's going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Qaeda thing is just going to get even bigger and their hatred towards the U.S. is just going to get even bigger because we're now trying to change them \nAnd they've been going on this whole totalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it's going to \nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat's it \nOkay",
            "I don't see how it would be right to make it constitutionally legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal because I think it's up to the churches, as it's even stated in the constitution, separation of church and state. It's clear that trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be in direct contradiction to what has already been said and written in the constitution. In terms of the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really just choosing one church's belief over another because most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas. I don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal. The decision of what's legal or illegal should be left up to the churches. Separation of church and state is basically a key aspect of the constitution and what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Although they thought about proposing an amendment, I think even proposing an amendment about it would be completely wrong and in direct contradiction to what's already been said and written there. I also think that it would be one of the few amendments that actually restricts the people rather than the government. So, I don't think that's right. No, I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic, and as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion. So I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular, and there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it, I think, by I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nWell, \nTo start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUh \nAnd I think that it's \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear, clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUh \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with a country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUh \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short, successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was a lot of tension and there was a civil war and \nUh \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUh \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell, that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUh \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is it too much to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue \nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions was before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nUh \nI just hope that it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I think I'm for gay marriage, I've always been. I really think it's a personal preference and it's something that's been proven more and more now that it's biological rather than sociological, so to give people less rights due to something that's really not under their control. I think it's kinda inhumane and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think there's any role for politics and government in this; it's not even at a state level, it's a personal level, a family level. I know two or three openly gay couples in my neighborhood who aren't married or anything because they're not allowed to, but they function the same way as any other family would. They walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to is kinda ridiculous.\n\nYeah, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different publications and TV reports or newspapers that it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain, something you might be predisposed to be gay. As opposed to growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know you don't have anything to do with it, so that would be the biological side rather than sociological.\n\nWell, other than the obvious, I think maybe because marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it they can do it without telling a single person, just run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it'll make the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it should be a personal, private, matter rather than a public and national issue.\n\nNo, no.",

            "I think the war has been going on for too long, I think the purpose in the beginning was good. To restore democracy in another country is a good purpose. But I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose and we're now maybe just doing it because we're doing it to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I also think the original motivations were questionable because of George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \n\nSo, I think if the original motivation was to give democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, if there were personal matters involved I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. I think we got our purpose across in the first couple of months just starting the war, I think that was a statement in and of itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too long.\n\nYeah, I think. I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think our reason over time has been deteriorated and misconceived. It seems like we're still at war just to go to war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive end, a victory or whatever.\n\nYeah, I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway, and I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf, like poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out.\n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our budget for the long term. There are obvious things like poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that, healthcare, that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for.",
            "Can I ask a question clarifying that it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like that\n\nO k, umm, no I don't think that's an invasion of privacy on sites such as Myspace if I mean if you post information on the internet it's pretty much available for everyone to see and I understand on Myspace you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile you might need to be their friend or something like that but if that's the case you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it you're giving them permission to see your profile so I mean anytime you put information on the internet you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that so if I think that was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think O let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything um I mean I don't think it would really be right to go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something so I don't really know\n\nYeah, um well, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook I do it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me and I saw something on TV once that was about this this man who just he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me and it's hard because you think that they know your interests they know what you look like sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day who your friends are they pretty much know a lot about you all sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends I don't want to limit it too much so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know I mean you never really know who can look at what so\n\nHum, uh, well I heard my roommate was telling me that her um high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that's the only other thought I can think of \n\nYes",

I mean, I hate to say you know, I hate joining the bandwagon of people who say I was against it from the beginning. Yeah, I was, but it's not really important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now, think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states, I mean, it's just too big a gap for this administration or previous administrations to understand. And they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that totally different people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's arguing that he wasn't, but, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them, I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that, but, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago, that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these people that we're trying to save, these people that we're trying to help, are telling us to leave. Yeah, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. If it completely goes to hell, we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we'll, I mean if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the US. \n\nNot just for women, I think it has to do with the specific field of work you're in. \n\nI mean, overall, I think women have it harder because of the \"glass ceiling\" where even with equal opportunities, most people have a hard time finding someone who works under a woman if they're a man. \n\nBecause society has been built this way for so long. \n\nAnd often in the workplace, women see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position just because historically, it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. \n\nAnd, I think the same goes for men. \n\nIn certain industries like fashion or raising children at home, it's really uncommon for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. \n\nAnd often, people will look down on them because society thinks, \"Well, you're a man, you should be working and making money, why are you staying at home?\" \n\nAnd it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and the woman has a better job. \n\nAnd it's working out fine for them, but society looks down on it. \n\nIn the fashion industry, it's often the case that people won't take straight men seriously who are interested in fashion. \n\nI don't know if that makes sense, but I think it's because men who are interested in fashion often have a different lifestyle. \n\nSo if you have a typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women, like you don't really know what our case is like, like the other guys.\" \n\nAnd depending on the field of work you're in, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the US. \n\nIt's hard to change because society has a set mindset, and we've made huge progress since the 1800s, but it's a slow process. \n\nIf we continue at the same rate because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, it's a long process. \n\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. \n\nAnd just like men who stay at home to raise their children, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh wait, maybe the woman has the better job or she wants to be the one working.\" \n\nAnd in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Oh wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or wives and stuff, so they do know where I'm coming from.\" \n\nSo maybe you have to promote it by showing the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against without being too pushy. \n\nIf you force it, people will resist. \n\nAnd I think we're in a good balance where it's starting to permeate that way. \n\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist. \n\nAnd we've made progress, and change takes time. \n\nYes, and... \n\nThere is also discrimination between genders, depending on the field of work you're in or where you're from. \n\nIf you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't that great, but you're extremely intelligent and you worked your way up to a CEO position, other men will look down on you because they'll say, \"I don't know if you really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right.\" \n\nSo it's sometimes like where you're from discriminates against you. \n\nAnd between genders. \n\nI don't know, I think that would be another example.",
            "I mean they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nAh \nThat knocked it down from a crime to like a traffic violation \nYou know it’s a crime you get punished for, but you don’t get arrested and taken to jail \nAh \nI think if someone gets caught and gets punished then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nI don’t think the negative consequences go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut there’s an argument that \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest someone and take them to a cell and book them and then let them go and then bring them to court maybe two times maybe three \nAnd then hire a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press charges \nI mean all these things cost a lot of money \nAnd I mean \nWhen you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble I mean a lot of them aren’t philosophically willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open-minded \nI have to use the word liberal \nI understand what I mean \nA kind of way of thinking \nThen I think it’s fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on social programs for seniors and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for homeless people \nAh \nI think it’s \nIt’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you want just lying around everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole financial aspect to it as well \nOther reasons why it shouldn’t be done \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel if it were completely legal \nI mean you could sell it like cigarettes in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be smoking and driving \nAnd it’s still taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nAh \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI think it would be uncomfortable for a lot of people \nAh \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is a bit low \nAh \nI don’t really know \nAh \nI think alcohol has more of a negative effect on your ability to drive \nAh \nI think marijuana has a more negative effect on a person’s lifestyle \nIn comparison to their decision making and control \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their negative effects \nAnd I mean when it comes to substances in general \nIt seems like no two people react the same \nI mean and some people have normal personalities and they just do everything they have \nAnd then there are people who can control themselves and then there are people who can’t \nSo \nI think it’s hard to make general statements about the substance when people react differently \nBut I do think they both have their negative effects \nAh \nYeah \nAh \nNo I don’t",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they've done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt's good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it's also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI think \nMany Catholics believe they have to go to Church every Sunday \nAnd \nUm \nThey're very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don't accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI'm sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad's religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat's not really \nLike \nTo say to love others and then not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI think a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it's so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don't think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don't think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nBecause it's just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don't think that that would be an issue \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it's a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you're going to do something like that \nYou're probably going to do it whether or not you're married \nLike \nI don't think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope",
            "I'm not sure, I haven't made up my mind on this matter yet. So I can't say if one side is right or wrong. But I believe this is the most complicated aspect we're facing today. Because there's something delicate about the separation of church and state. And defining marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending anyone. So I don't know, I think. I think that all civil unions are something that I don't know if marriage should be looked at as. And like defined by the government, since it's considered a sacrament. Well, people wouldn't get tax breaks or looked at any differently by the government if they were baptized. And so if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is. It's two people, they shouldn't have a separation of church and state, they shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was. Two people got united. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, that would just be two people who got a civil union. \n\nWell, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just absurd. It is something like the constitution shouldn't just be amended because it's a big issue for certain people. I mean it's a very big topic for some people. But it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Simply put. Uh no",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a gray area for me. \n\nBecause I have a lot of gay friends. \n\nI think that I don’t necessarily agree with that lifestyle. \n\nBut I think that it should be legalized. \n\nI don’t think it should be a national issue. \n\nHowever I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than something the president decides for the entire country. \n\nWell, like many states are democratic, so many also have republican governments. \n\nObviously democratic states are going to vote for gay marriage. \n\nAnd if you live in a democratic state, you already know how that state feels about that position. \n\nI don’t think you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. \n\nBecause you’ve already chosen to live there. \n\nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals. \n\nSo I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. \n\nWell I kind of already said that. \n\nNow, I don’t think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. \n\nI think it should be up to each individual state as to whether they want to legalize it. \n\nI don’t agree with his stance against gay marriage. \n\nI just think some things should be left up to each individual state. \n\nPlus he’s going to be out of office in about two years. \n\nAnd if a democratic president decides he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it’s just going to go back and forth. \n\nIt should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are going to have to live with that decision, not the president. \n\nNo I don’t.",
            "I mean, no, I don't think so. I mean, let's see how I look at it. MySpace is a public thing, and a bulletin, you know? If you look at that definition, then you know that's basically to post for the public to see or for others to see. Whatever you're trying to get at, and now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it's school officials or not. So in my opinion, I think that school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But yeah, to prevent a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. I mean, let me see here. Like, if they go on to the internet, like on MySpace, just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble, and I think that's an invasion of privacy. But I think as long as they save lives, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. I mean, should I elaborate more on that? Yeah, I mean, okay, well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. But in order for them to express themselves, they need to be able to write.\n\nIn order for me to express myself, I'd rather write. Alright, well, like what I was saying, it's a public thing, and with a student posting something on MySpace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. I mean, everything, like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails. Like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that in an email because I'm afraid someone will pick it up and... you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, you know? If you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll find an email you sent somehow, and once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't think that's an invasion of privacy at all because, like I said before, it's a public thing. And well, that's basically all I've been saying, that it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here. Like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I think that's perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on. You know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like they're dropping them off at a safe place, and I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because we would do like lockdowns and stuff and... that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because, you know, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess. So we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. No, that's it.",
            "Okay, let's talk about war. At first, I was all for it because I was personally affected by 9/11. I was for going over there and causing as much chaos as they caused here. I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. We went there without a plan and were unprepared. I think that ultimately backfired on us. I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think we accomplished anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us as well. Like, I don't think us being there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. Unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've almost lost all feelings for what's going on over there. I just don't care about them. I don't think they're human, I don't know. They're just fighting with each other and can't get anything done, so I really don't care. We went over there completely unprepared, we didn't know what we were going to face over there. It's also bad because war is different for them than it is for us. They're like savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're looking to better their country, I think they're just looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. We were just hyped up, I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. We pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. But also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. At the time, I see where he was coming from, we really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, 'Okay, let's rebuild and that's it.' So, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order. I don't know, I just think that they didn't have any unity, they didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made progress, but not enough to stay in there. And I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. And we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views are a bit old-fashioned. They have strong opinions on many things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. I think this is one of the reasons why the Catholic Church is losing followers. They are not very open to many things. \n\nI think if they were to adapt a bit, they wouldn't lose as many followers. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because they don't share their views. They think the Catholic Church has the wrong views. If you're for abortion, for example, you might not feel comfortable in a community that believes abortion is wrong. The same goes for gay marriage and other things. If you believe the Catholic Church is wrong, you might not be able to join a community that upholds these views. I think there's no reason why priests can't get married or why there can't be female priests. But I'm not sure if that would have made a difference. \n\nIf priests got married or there were female priests, it might not have made a difference. It's hard to say if they would have acted differently. I think there's no reason why priests can't get married. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God, but I don't think that's the same as a marriage. Everyone has a job and a family and other people they love. Why shouldn't that be the same for priests?",
            "I personally don't oppose men getting married. I think one doesn't consciously decide whether to be gay or not. I think you shouldn't be held responsible for who you are. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this much thought, but I think it's wrong for them to say that. \n\nIt seems to me that it's not like a choice whether you're gay or not. I mean, you're either gay or straight, and that's something you can't actively choose. It's like being born gay or not, and I think it's wrong to hold someone responsible for their sexual orientation. \n\nI think the federal government shouldn't interfere because it's not a legal or moral issue. I mean, you should just accept who you are and not try to change someone. It's tough to exclude the federal government, but I think they shouldn't interfere because it's not their business. \n\nIt's hard to exclude them, but I think they shouldn't interfere because it's not their thing. It's not about national security or moral concerns, it's just that they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have the right to interfere in people's lives. And you know, that's who they are, the gay people, that's just how they were born, at least that's what I think, and I mean they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn’t a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but they are just different. It’s like two different sides of the same coin, and heads will never be tails, but it’s the same thing. There are many civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and healthcare, where your primary or next of kin can’t visit because they aren’t technically family. It’s silly to spend the rest of your life with someone but not be able to have them in the room with you if you’re sick. Many scientific studies have been done and they show that homosexual couples have the same success rates and the same factors that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It’s just a relationship, it’s the same thing. Where people get hung up is that homosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church, they’re asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no involvement with church and state, then it shouldn’t be an issue. The Catholic church can believe whatever they want, but it shouldn’t be an issue in a legal sense. If you’re allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It’s like segregation, separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the roles played by different partners and so on. People are worried about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. They are especially worried about children of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society, but it’s hard to say. The main drawback to adoption is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. In New York City, they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools, kids get bullied and beat up, and parents protest to get them removed from school. It’s just a kid, they have the same points of view and everything, and parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. They can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But President Bush has very strong views related to his religion. His views on gay marriage go along with his views on abortion and stem cell research, and most of the reasons I’ve heard are moral reasons. Morality is not always negotiable, but it differs from person to person. It’s not fair to embrace the morality of one group in America while ignoring the culture and morality of the rest. It’s not fair to go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the whole country. It’s hypocritical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage considering the recent controversy over “under God” in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are opposed to that but will let laws be made that enforce religious standards on the whole country. Many people are against gay people and gay marriage because they believe they are somehow psychologically damaged. The American Psychological Association has just put out a memo saying that is untrue. If people listened to institutions that actually do research and studies on these subjects instead of their neighbors and friends, and maybe what’s popular opinion in their culture and church, then the world would be seen a little bit differently. No.",

            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. I understand that it's not as strict as it used to be. I know, even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would wear cute little dresses. And I would wear matching shoes. And I would wear a matching purse. That was the case when I went to a private school. And I would see all my friends on the weekends. And we would just go. But now, as I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass. And they cut it down to 30 minutes. And people dress a lot more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes, straight from the beach. You'd have families there who are just running late. So I think it's become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. People are wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just a lot more casual compared to that. What I've noticed is that that's the biggest thing that's changed. That's the church I know. I don't know the politics of the church and whatnot. But yeah, that's it. [OK, what exactly do you have to say about the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia?] I don't think these things could have been prevented. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. I think even if you let them get married, it's just the person. It's not because they're allowed to get married or not. I also think that when they become a priest, it's their decision. There are religions where they're allowed to get married. For example, on Seventh Heaven. I don't know what kind of [a reverend or a minister or something]. [mm hmm] But they're allowed to get married. I know it's a little different. If they really want to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe choose a different faith. [OK, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, about the changes. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, pedophilia. [Mm hmm] I think like the whole thing, sexual attraction before, as if it were genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I don't think people become it. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with upbringing. It might have something to do a little bit in this case, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through a marriage. You could try, but then it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, but I don't think in all cases they knew. [OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] No",
            "I was initially okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still pretty much reeling from the 9/11 attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that the Bush administration was quick to connect the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general the Iraq war really boils my blood. I was initially for the Iraq war, but now I think it was a bad idea to think that we would find WMDs in Iraq. I think that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, I mean, after he came back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that is a perversion of the constitution, I think that is an impeachable offense because they lied to the American people. I think that the Bush administration completely disregards the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since September 11. Honestly, I think they had the intention to go to war from the start. I think they went into Iraq to secure their energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. I think it's gone on long enough, but I also think that if we withdraw now, there's a good chance that the country will plunge into civil war and even more people will die as a result. I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving towards now seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to try to restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea because I think it will also cause more problems in the long term because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major point of contention. I think the interim government is dissolving because it's not effective. I've heard that the parliament is not very effective and that the Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process or what's happening. And also Mugtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I think it was less than a year ago, his party now has at least 20 seats in the Iraqi parliament and I think we're still dealing with radical elements that are vying for control of the government. I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. I can't discuss this in polite company.",
            "I was thinking \nI mean, let's just talk about this? \nOkay, cool \nUh-huh \nUh \nOkay, sorry \nOkay \nHow do I feel about the war in Iraq? \nLet me see \nUh \nAt this point, I feel like it's kind of pointless because it's not even officially declared as a war \nAnd I think it was just a big revenge thing against Iraq because we thought they were the ones who bombed the U.S. \nYou know, like the 9/11 attacks \nSo I don't feel like \nI mean, I'm not a big fan of the war in Iraq \nSo I don't really keep up with it \nI don't know the big details of it \nBut at this point, I know we're just going to stay there and try to build democracy so it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd also so we can get oil and resources from them \nBut that's not a good reason to stay there because it's causing a lot of resentment \nSo \nAnd then, if we stay there, it's going to end up with us trying to build democracy, which is going to take forever because democracy can't be built in a day \nAnd then if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUh \nLet me think \nOh, this is so difficult \nThis is the one topic I don't know anything about \nUh \nWar in Iraq \nOh, this is hard \nUh \nMmm \nI don't know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOkay \nThanks \nUh \nWell, actually \nI think \nI think the war should continue because it's not fair \nI don't think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I think \nYou know \nI think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore \nBecause we didn't even declare it \nI think that's how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by Congress \nAnd then it's \nI just don't think it's a big deal to stay there and try to help them \nBut it's also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like \nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of what it's doing and it's like \nAnd what it's doing to \nRemember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nThe Vietnam War was an undeclared war and it's now considered a meaningless war \nAnd he's like saying \nHe'll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nDoesn't this have to be a half an hour? \nUh \nOkay, yeah \nUh \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to continue because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are just killing each other because of different beliefs \nBut then again \nIt's like \nIt's hard to say \nI want them to be there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there, we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nIt's going to be even worse for them \nAnd it's going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Qaeda thing is just going to get even bigger and their hatred towards the U.S. is just going to get even bigger because we're now trying to change them \nAnd they've been going on this whole totalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it's going to \nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat's it \nOkay",
            "I don't see how it would be right to make it constitutionally legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal because I think it's up to the churches, as it's even stated in the constitution, separation of church and state. It's clear that trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be in direct contradiction to what has already been said and written in the constitution. In terms of the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really just choosing one church's belief over another because most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas. I don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal. The decision of what's legal or illegal should be left up to the churches. Separation of church and state is basically a key aspect of the constitution and what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Although they thought about proposing an amendment, I think even proposing an amendment about it would be completely wrong and in direct contradiction to what's already been said and written there. I also think that it would be one of the few amendments that actually restricts the people rather than the government. So, I don't think that's right. No, I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic, and as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion. So I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular, and there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it, I think, by I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nWell, \nTo start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUh \nAnd I think that it's \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear, clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUh \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with a country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUh \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short, successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was a lot of tension and there was a civil war and \nUh \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUh \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell, that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUh \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is it too much to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue \nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions was before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nUh \nI just hope that it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I think I'm for gay marriage, I've always been. I really think it's a personal preference and it's something that's been proven more and more now that it's biological rather than sociological, so to give people less rights due to something that's really not under their control. I think it's kinda inhumane and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think there's any role for politics and government in this; it's not even at a state level, it's a personal level, a family level. I know two or three openly gay couples in my neighborhood who aren't married or anything because they're not allowed to, but they function the same way as any other family would. They walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to is kinda ridiculous.\n\nYeah, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different publications and TV reports or newspapers that it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain, something you might be predisposed to be gay. As opposed to growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know you don't have anything to do with it, so that would be the biological side rather than sociological.\n\nWell, other than the obvious, I think maybe because marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it they can do it without telling a single person, just run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it'll make the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it should be a personal, private, matter rather than a public and national issue.\n\nNo, no.",

            "I think the war has been going on for too long, I think the purpose in the beginning was good. To restore democracy in another country is a good purpose. But I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose and we're now maybe just doing it because we're doing it to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I also think the original motivations were questionable because of George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \n\nSo, I think if the original motivation was to give democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, if there were personal matters involved I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. I think we got our purpose across in the first couple of months just starting the war, I think that was a statement in and of itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too long.\n\nYeah, I think. I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think our reason over time has been deteriorated and misconceived. It seems like we're still at war just to go to war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive end, a victory or whatever.\n\nYeah, I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway, and I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf, like poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out.\n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our budget for the long term. There are obvious things like poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that, healthcare, that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for.",
            "Can I ask a question clarifying that it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like that\n\nO k, umm, no I don't think that's an invasion of privacy on sites such as Myspace if I mean if you post information on the internet it's pretty much available for everyone to see and I understand on Myspace you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile you might need to be their friend or something like that but if that's the case you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it you're giving them permission to see your profile so I mean anytime you put information on the internet you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that so if I think that was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think O let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything um I mean I don't think it would really be right to go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something so I don't really know\n\nYeah, um well, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook I do it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me and I saw something on TV once that was about this this man who just he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me and it's hard because you think that they know your interests they know what you look like sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day who your friends are they pretty much know a lot about you all sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends I don't want to limit it too much so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know I mean you never really know who can look at what so\n\nHum, uh, well I heard my roommate was telling me that her um high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that's the only other thought I can think of \n\nYes",

I mean, I hate to say you know, I hate joining the bandwagon of people who say I was against it from the beginning. Yeah, I was, but it's not really important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now, think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states, I mean, it's just too big a gap for this administration or previous administrations to understand. And they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that totally different people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's arguing that he wasn't, but, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them, I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that, but, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago, that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these people that we're trying to save, these people that we're trying to help, are telling us to leave. Yeah, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. If it completely goes to hell, we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we'll, I mean if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the US. \n\nNot just for women, I think it has to do with the specific field of work you're in. \n\nI mean, overall, I think women have it harder because of the \"glass ceiling\" where even with equal opportunities, most people have a hard time finding someone who works under a woman if they're a man. \n\nBecause society has been built this way for so long. \n\nAnd often in the workplace, women see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position just because historically, it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. \n\nAnd, I think the same goes for men. \n\nIn certain industries like fashion or raising children at home, it's really uncommon for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. \n\nAnd often, people will look down on them because society thinks, \"Well, you're a man, you should be working and making money, why are you staying at home?\" \n\nAnd it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and the woman has a better job. \n\nAnd it's working out fine for them, but society looks down on it. \n\nIn the fashion industry, it's often the case that people won't take straight men seriously who are interested in fashion. \n\nI don't know if that makes sense, but I think it's because men who are interested in fashion often have a different lifestyle. \n\nSo if you have a typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women, like you don't really know what our case is like, like the other guys.\" \n\nAnd depending on the field of work you're in, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the US. \n\nIt's hard to change because society has a set mindset, and we've made huge progress since the 1800s, but it's a slow process. \n\nIf we continue at the same rate because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, it's a long process. \n\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. \n\nAnd just like men who stay at home to raise their children, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh wait, maybe the woman has the better job or she wants to be the one working.\" \n\nAnd in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Oh wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or wives and stuff, so they do know where I'm coming from.\" \n\nSo maybe you have to promote it by showing the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against without being too pushy. \n\nIf you force it, people will resist. \n\nAnd I think we're in a good balance where it's starting to permeate that way. \n\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist. \n\nAnd we've made progress, and change takes time. \n\nYes, and... \n\nThere is also discrimination between genders, depending on the field of work you're in or where you're from. \n\nIf you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't that great, but you're extremely intelligent and you worked your way up to a CEO position, other men will look down on you because they'll say, \"I don't know if you really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right.\" \n\nSo it's sometimes like where you're from discriminates against you. \n\nAnd between genders. \n\nI don't know, I think that would be another example.",
            "I mean they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nAh \nThat knocked it down from a crime to like a traffic violation \nYou know it’s a crime you get punished for, but you don’t get arrested and taken to jail \nAh \nI think if someone gets caught and gets punished then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nI don’t think the negative consequences go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut there’s an argument that \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest someone and take them to a cell and book them and then let them go and then bring them to court maybe two times maybe three \nAnd then hire a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press charges \nI mean all these things cost a lot of money \nAnd I mean \nWhen you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble I mean a lot of them aren’t philosophically willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open-minded \nI have to use the word liberal \nI understand what I mean \nA kind of way of thinking \nThen I think it’s fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on social programs for seniors and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for homeless people \nAh \nI think it’s \nIt’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you want just lying around everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole financial aspect to it as well \nOther reasons why it shouldn’t be done \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel if it were completely legal \nI mean you could sell it like cigarettes in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be smoking and driving \nAnd it’s still taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nAh \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI think it would be uncomfortable for a lot of people \nAh \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is a bit low \nAh \nI don’t really know \nAh \nI think alcohol has more of a negative effect on your ability to drive \nAh \nI think marijuana has a more negative effect on a person’s lifestyle \nIn comparison to their decision making and control \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their negative effects \nAnd I mean when it comes to substances in general \nIt seems like no two people react the same \nI mean and some people have normal personalities and they just do everything they have \nAnd then there are people who can control themselves and then there are people who can’t \nSo \nI think it’s hard to make general statements about the substance when people react differently \nBut I do think they both have their negative effects \nAh \nYeah \nAh \nNo I don’t",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they've done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt's good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it's also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI think \nMany Catholics believe they have to go to Church every Sunday \nAnd \nUm \nThey're very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don't accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI'm sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad's religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat's not really \nLike \nTo say to love others and then not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI think a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it's so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don't think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don't think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nBecause it's just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don't think that that would be an issue \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it's a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you're going to do something like that \nYou're probably going to do it whether or not you're married \nLike \nI don't think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope",
            "I'm not sure, I haven't made up my mind on this matter yet. So I can't say if one side is right or wrong. But I believe this is the most complicated aspect we're facing today. Because there's something delicate about the separation of church and state. And defining marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending anyone. So I don't know, I think. I think that all civil unions are something that I don't know if marriage should be looked at as. And like defined by the government, since it's considered a sacrament. Well, people wouldn't get tax breaks or looked at any differently by the government if they were baptized. And so if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is. It's two people, they shouldn't have a separation of church and state, they shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was. Two people got united. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, that would just be two people who got a civil union. \n\nWell, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just absurd. It is something like the constitution shouldn't just be amended because it's a big issue for certain people. I mean it's a very big topic for some people. But it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Simply put. Uh no",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a gray area for me. \n\nBecause I have a lot of gay friends. \n\nI think that I don’t necessarily agree with that lifestyle. \n\nBut I think that it should be legalized. \n\nI don’t think it should be a national issue. \n\nHowever I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than something the president decides for the entire country. \n\nWell, like many states are democratic, so many also have republican governments. \n\nObviously democratic states are going to vote for gay marriage. \n\nAnd if you live in a democratic state, you already know how that state feels about that position. \n\nI don’t think you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. \n\nBecause you’ve already chosen to live there. \n\nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals. \n\nSo I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. \n\nWell I kind of already said that. \n\nNow, I don’t think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. \n\nI think it should be up to each individual state as to whether they want to legalize it. \n\nI don’t agree with his stance against gay marriage. \n\nI just think some things should be left up to each individual state. \n\nPlus he’s going to be out of office in about two years. \n\nAnd if a democratic president decides he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it’s just going to go back and forth. \n\nIt should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are going to have to live with that decision, not the president. \n\nNo I don’t.",
            "I mean, no, I don't think so. I mean, let's see how I look at it. MySpace is a public thing, and a bulletin, you know? If you look at that definition, then you know that's basically to post for the public to see or for others to see. Whatever you're trying to get at, and now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it's school officials or not. So in my opinion, I think that school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But yeah, to prevent a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. I mean, let me see here. Like, if they go on to the internet, like on MySpace, just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble, and I think that's an invasion of privacy. But I think as long as they save lives, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. I mean, should I elaborate more on that? Yeah, I mean, okay, well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. But in order for them to express themselves, they need to be able to write.\n\nIn order for me to express myself, I'd rather write. Alright, well, like what I was saying, it's a public thing, and with a student posting something on MySpace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. I mean, everything, like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails. Like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that in an email because I'm afraid someone will pick it up and... you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, you know? If you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll find an email you sent somehow, and once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't think that's an invasion of privacy at all because, like I said before, it's a public thing. And well, that's basically all I've been saying, that it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here. Like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I think that's perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on. You know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like they're dropping them off at a safe place, and I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because we would do like lockdowns and stuff and... that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because, you know, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess. So we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. No, that's it.",
            "Okay, let's talk about war. At first, I was all for it because I was personally affected by 9/11. I was for going over there and causing as much chaos as they caused here. I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. We went there without a plan and were unprepared. I think that ultimately backfired on us. I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think we accomplished anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us as well. Like, I don't think us being there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. Unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've almost lost all feelings for what's going on over there. I just don't care about them. I don't think they're human, I don't know. They're just fighting with each other and can't get anything done, so I really don't care. We went over there completely unprepared, we didn't know what we were going to face over there. It's also bad because war is different for them than it is for us. They're like savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're looking to better their country, I think they're just looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. We were just hyped up, I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. We pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. But also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. At the time, I see where he was coming from, we really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, 'Okay, let's rebuild and that's it.' So, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order. I don't know, I just think that they didn't have any unity, they didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made progress, but not enough to stay in there. And I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. And we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay."
