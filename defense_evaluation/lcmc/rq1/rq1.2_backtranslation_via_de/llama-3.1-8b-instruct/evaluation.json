            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways, their views. Many people have talked about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of many things. In the case of gay marriages, in the case of abortion, in the case of birth control, such things. I think the Catholic Church has very strong views on them, which is fine, but they have somewhat old-fashioned views in some ways. So I think if they would adapt to maybe a bit newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church a bit because of their view on these situations. And many people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. So I feel that they feel the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things. Yeah, I mean the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you are for abortion, you might not be happy in a community where that is taught as completely wrong and you are against it. I mean the same with gay marriages and such things, where if you believe in them and want to do them or even just feel strongly about them, you might not want to be in a community where they don't agree with that. I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or priests who are married. But I don't know if that would necessarily have prevented what happened. I mean I don't know, I don't know if they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don't know if that would have necessarily changed it. I mean that was something they did, and that was something that didn't really seem to be affected. I mean if they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to really tell. Yeah, I mean I don't see why priests can't be married. The Catholic Church says that priests are basically married to God and are devoted to their life, but I don't see why everyone else who has a job can't have a family life and the other people they love, so I don't see why priests can't have both. No.",
            "I personally think I'm not opposed to marriage, I think that people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation or whatever. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't really. I haven't really put a lot of thought into the topic, but I would definitely say it's wrong. \n\nIt seems that it's not so much like a choice, like they don't really have a choice on how they are. I mean, I was born straight and another person is born gay, I guess. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. \n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved because it's nothing involving the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interfere in people's lives. And that's just who they are - gay people, that's just how they were born or at least that's what I think. And I mean, they shouldn't be punished for that. \n\nUh, no, that's it.",
            "I think that same-sex marriage should be legalized because, well, there's just not a good reason not to. Because many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but that's just so different, and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. And there are so many civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick, and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand how people like Catholics can get hung up on \"oh, well, that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing,\" but in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not a marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yes, they are, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues, and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation choices or not, but well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very strong views of his own to do with his religion. Well, his take on gay marriage actually um is I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which um I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect and that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "At first, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties.

But for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes because just because a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial.

You should acknowledge its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nAt first, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol because marijuana, if you abuse it, it's not as bad as alcohol, although if you abuse alcohol, it can lead to bad things. At first, I'd say no, you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused, but if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly.\n\nUh, yeah, at first, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug.

            "I was talking about how I feel about the war in Iraq. I feel it's kind of pointless because it's not even an officially declared war. I think it was just a revenge thing against Iraq because we thought they were behind the 9/11 attacks. Like, who was responsible? I'm not a big war opponent against the Iraq war, I don't keep up with it and I don't know the details. But at this point, I know we're just staying there to build a system that can slowly develop into a democracy, and we also want their oil and resources. But it's no reason to stay there because it just creates more trouble. And then if we stay there, we'll have to try and build a democracy, which will take forever because democracy can't be created overnight. And then if we leave, they'll be angry with us because we've messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. Let me think. Oh, this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. \n\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but I think the only reason we use guns and stuff is just to show that we're big and American and have all these big guns. But I don't think there's a huge reason for us to keep calling it a war anymore because we didn't even declare it as a war by Congress. I think that's how it works, you have to declare a war by Congress and then it's official. I just don't think it's a big point to still stay there and try. But I do think it's a point to stay there and try to help them, but it's also like wasting our resources. And right now, I feel really bad for Bush because it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. because of what it's doing and how it's affecting the country. Remember, I think with the whole Vietnam thing, the Vietnam War was an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war and he's going to be called that president forever. So, I think it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families I know whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and I want it to keep going because I want them to be safe, you know. These people over there have lives too and we've kind of destroyed them because now we've taken away their homes and their schools and their communities and now they're just fighting against each other because of their different beliefs. But then again, it's like, it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there, we're going to be trying to mold them into a second United States, and that's going to make it even worse for them. And it's going to be like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even bigger and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even bigger because we're trying to change them and they've been under this totalitarian dictatorship for so long that it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years.",
            "I don't know, I don't think it's right for it to be legalized or for a state to even declare it as legal. I think it's really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state. It's clear, it's clear. I don't know, it's clearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone in the constitution. So, in terms of the people who want to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another. Because as we can see, most Catholics, Catholics are and Christians are really against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas. But I don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal and legal. Well, separation of church and state is pretty much a key aspect of the constitution and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they did plan on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just in contradiction to what's already been said and written there. And plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't think that's right at all in that aspect. No, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else if anything, it could possibly boost it, I think, by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nOkay, I'll start from the beginning. I think the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war \nBefore invading Iraq, and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but in reality, it had very little to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage over the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, and the invasion of Iraq began in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against the war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike, I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that the \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes they made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers died \n\nAnd that's \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing, they were removing the country's government, and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nFor the aftermath and the power vacuum and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States removed the Iraqi government and \n\nThey were trying to implement a democratic government, and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out the Communists \nAnd \nAnd support or implement \nImplement and support democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat wasn't going to be a clear-cut victory, like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there \nBecause there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens of the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think the government \nSo first of all, I think we shouldn't have gone to war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases, and \nBut if you do go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government wasn't as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worse \nAnd \nIf they didn't plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government, and \nI mean we're still there today, almost the end of 2006, and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying, and \nAnd they're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process, and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell, they weren't prepared themselves, but in a way tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a \nA short, successful stay in Iraq, and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive to believe it would be that way because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was a lot of tension and there was a civil war, and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do, and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell, that's \nNo, that's \nNo, that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat's \nWell, that was kind of my feeling, I guess, in the election \nLike the presidential election of 2004, when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote, and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what he started, and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there, we've been there for so long, how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones who took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life, so how can we abandon them now \nAbandon them so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to the end, but again, there's also the consideration of the astronomical number of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is too much to risk for \nFor a free, democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing this to all these other countries, and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil \nAnd this is where we get our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and resources, \nI mean because another one of the preconditions before going to war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd places like North Korea, we actually knew they had weapons of mass destruction, and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nUm \nI just hope it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "Okay, let's see. I'm for gay marriage, I've always been for it. It's a personal preference and something that's been proven to be biological rather than sociological, so people shouldn't have fewer rights just because something is not in their control. It's inhumane to do so. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. \n\nI don't think there's any reason for politics and government to be involved in this. It's not even on the state level, it's a personal level, it's a family level. You know in my neighborhood at home, there are probably two or three openly gay couples, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way as any other family would. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that with Bush trying to play God and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, it's ridiculous. \n\nYeah, sure. I mean I think I've read and heard from various publications and TV reports or newspapers that it's something chemical in the brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be homosexual. In contrast to growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother, you know you don't have a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side rather than sociological.\n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that you know in this, I think maybe because marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can without telling a single person run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to be on the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's kinda the type of thing it should be a personal, private, sector type thing rather than public domain and national or federal domain. \n\nNo, no",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum, it's completely public, you can't.  I mean as an RA, it's something that I've already had to deal with.  When you put something out there, it's going to color people's opinions of you, and if you're talking about blowing things up or if you're talking about shootings, someone's going to say something.  You can't put that out there, put that out to the world.  The internet is seen by everyone.  If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin.  Obviously it wasn't the school that got the bulletin, someone went to the school and they have to act on it.  They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something does happen, they could have prevented it.  [Right]  But again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just make jokes about it. I mean it could be like the situation we had at school, it could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class, sorry I couldn't remember the word for a minute.  And it could also be something very serious.  I think.  What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got very worried because there were some certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke.  But in light of the situation became very serious.  When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens.  If you don't want it out there, don't put it there.  If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think.  You can't tell people what to take seriously or not.  I mean I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them.  And going through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals.  But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it.  And if there's danger they have to take it seriously.  I mean like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IM's and.  If it's brought to their attention then it's something completely different.  Um, yeah don't, like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing.  It's not my place, I don't even want that connection there.  Um, not really",
            "I think the war has been dragging on for too long. I think the purpose was good in the beginning. To restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since forgotten the purpose. And we're now maybe just doing it to prove something, to show that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I also think the original motives were questionable when dealing with George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. So I think, I think the original motivation, if it was to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would have been a fair motivation. If there were personal matters in it, I don't think it would have been fair. But I think it's been dragging on. I think we made our point in the first couple of months, starting the war. I think that was in itself an explanation. But the fact that it's gone on for over a year, several years, I think it's dragged on too long. Yeah, I think, I mean if our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just cause. And that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think, I think our reasons have been eroded and misconceived over time. And it seems like we're still at war just because we want to be at war. And we don't want to come out of this thing without a clear victory or a success. Yeah, I think that it's gone on long enough. And it should stop. I mean, there's a point when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on something, as we have our own wars on our own turf, like poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out. Yeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars. And war shouldn't be in our budget for the long term. There are things like poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems, funding things like that, healthcare, that I think that money could be better spent on. Right now, that money is being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country, in a war that we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",
            "I'd like to clarify a question.\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like\n\nOkay, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like MySpace, if I mean if you post information online, it's pretty much available to everyone. And I understand on MySpace, you know, you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile. You might need to be their friend or something like that. If that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean anytime you put information online, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So, I think it was good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um, that's tough. Because I mean, obviously, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So, I don't really know.\n\nSure, um, well, like, I mean, I don't have a MySpace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just tried to prove how easily he could get information. And he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name in under a minute and was talking to her on instant messenger. In less than a minute, and I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I've had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never really know who can look at what.\n\nHum, um, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having MySpace by the school, and I found that a little strange, like I wasn't sure how school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have a MySpace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people. That's the only other thought I could think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm \nWell, we only have this and then another time I have to talk about the Iraq War \nUh \nYeah \nI mean I feel hypocritical talking about it \nI mean I hate to say you know \nI hate to join the bandwagon of people who are like \"I was against it from the beginning\" \nBut I was, but it's not really important anymore \nBecause the general consensus everywhere is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit that they were wrong \nAnd uh \nI mean you just have to look at the recent polls \nUh \nThey've done US polls \nThey've done Iraqi polls \nThey've done global polls \nAnd I mean not \nAbout 75 to 80 percent of the world's population thinks that it was a bad idea \n80 percent of Iraqis \nUh \n70 percent of the troops that are over there \nLike the US troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year \nUh \nI don't know \nIt's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in \nIt was already a disaster \nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster \nThere's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore \nUh \nI mean I think it's just \nThe culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states \nI mean it's just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations \nAnd they think that they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist \nLike that's not the way that \nUh \nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives \nI mean sure Saddam was a bad guy \nI don't think anyone's like arguing that he's not \nBut, I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to \nYou know turn into just a complete disaster \nJust like quicksand from when we went over there \nUh \nI don't even know what to say about it \nUh \nI don't really see a reason at all to stay in there \nUh \nI mean I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there \nUh \nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out \nI don't agree with them \nI've yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should \nUh \nI mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year \nUh \nI guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that \nBut, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now \nUh \nI mean I read this statistic a little while ago that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now \nAnd like these \nThese are the people that we're trying to save like that we're trying to help \nTelling us to leave \nUh \nYou know I think they might know better than that \nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it's not on us if something happens \nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to \nUh \nAnd then you know at least we'll \nI mean if we decide to help out after that we'll at least be the good guys \nKind of \nNot really, no \nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East \nBut, you know \nIt'll be better than you know where we are \nWhere we stand right now \nUh \nYeah \nUh \nNo",
            "Yes, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. \nAnd it \nNot just with women, but \nI think it has to do with the specific field or type of work one does. \nI mean, in general, I think women have it harder because there's the so-called \"glass ceiling\" where even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time finding someone to put in a position of authority if they're a woman, just because society has been raised this way \nOnly because of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd often in the workplace, women see that there's a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't choose to promote them to that position because historically, it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world \nAnd I \nI think the same thing applies to men \nAnd in other industries like fashion or \nIf someone stays home to take care of the kids \nThat's really uncommon \nUm \nMen who stay home are often looked down upon because society thinks that they, the man, should be working \nHe should be the breadwinner of the family \nWhy is he staying home? \nAnd it can be really tough for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the kids and help raise them, and maybe the woman has a better position \nAnd it's working out fine for them \nBut society looks down on that \nAnd in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of people don't take straight men seriously \nI don't know if that really makes sense \nBut I think it's because typically, men who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I think have different lifestyles \nAnd if you have a typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, wait, how can I really know if you know what fashion is if you're caring for a woman \nHow can you know what our situation is if you're talking to these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on the field you're in \nI think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nAnd it's hard to change because \nSociety has a pre-programmed mindset, and obviously, we've developed a lot since the 1800s, leaps and bounds \nBut change is slow, so I think we should continue at our pace because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process \nAnd it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd when men stay home to take care of the kids \nThen it's also accepted because they realize, oh wait, maybe the woman has a better position, or she wants to be the one working \nAnd so \nThen people are like, okay, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and so they know where I'm coming from \nAnd so you have to promote it in a way by highlighting the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped against \nBut not too pushy \nBut by saying the qualities of them \nBecause if you do it too fast, people will resist \nAnd I think we're on a good path where it's slowly becoming accepted \nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist \nAnd we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nPeople are probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from \nIf you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO position \nEven though you may not have the best grammar in the world \nOr even though you may be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world \nOther men will look down on you and be like, wait, how can I know if you really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYes \nSo sometimes, just where you're from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don't know \nI think that'd be another example \nUm \nNot really",
            "Okay, \n\nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nSwitching \nWhich brought it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo a kind of traffic offense \nOne knows that one will be cited for rather than being taken in and arrested and jailed and all that \nSwitching \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited for it, then one knows, for the purposes of job interviews and all these things like that \nSwitching \nThese types of consequences, which are usually like the worst consequences of a drug offense would \nI mean usually the worst consequences of a drug offense, depending on the offense \nAt least in the case of a marijuana charge \nSomething that many kids worry about, many people worry about are the future consequences and these don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and bring them in and book them \nAnd to put them in custody and then to release them \nAnd it costs a lot to have them come to court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd to appoint a public defender \nAnd to pay the judge and then the prosecutor’s office has to take up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of these things cost a lot of money \nAnd switching \nI mean so \nWhen you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean many of them are philosophically not willing to make this kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for them \nLike many communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a city like Denver, where people tend to be more open and liberal \nLike I have to say \nA kind of thought structure \nThen I think it’s completely fine \nAnd I’m sure that the municipality has a lot more money that they can spend on public education, on social programs for the elderly, and on \nOne knows what I mean \nFood programs for the homeless \nSwitching \nI mean I think that’s \nIt’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that just wants to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and so on \nSwitching \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s also a financial aspect to it \nOther reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell if it were completely legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes, sell it in gas stations and people would smoke it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess many people would smoke and drive \nAnd switching \nIt’s still taboo in our society \nIn many places and contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana openly \nFor me it would just be awkward for many people \nSwitching \nAnd \nSorry, what? \nThe volume on the microphone is a bit low \nSwitching \nI don’t really know \nI think generally alcohol has more significant effects on motor skills \nSwitching \nBut I think marijuana has a greater influence on people’s lifestyle \nIn contrast to their decision-making and motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean if it comes to substances in general \nLike not two people react the same way \nI mean and then there are people with normal personalities and they just go all in with everything they have \nAnd then there are people who know how to exercise moderation and then there are people who can’t \nSo \nI think that makes it very difficult to speak generally about substances \nWhen people react differently \nBut I think they both have their own adverse effects \nSwitching \nYes \nUh \nNo, I’m not",
            "I would say yes because a lot of the things they do are very traditional like they've been doing the same things for long periods of time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done and sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions like for example my mom was an Episcopalian no I'm sorry my dad was an Episcopalian my mom was a Catholic and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion and that's not really being tolerant of other religions we always learned to love others that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that so I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway I don't think that would necessarily influence it I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm it might but I probably don't think that that would be an issue well I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening I think that would probably happen regardless nope",
            "I'm not sure about this matter yet / I haven't made up my mind yet on this issue / I don't know if one side is right or wrong / However, I think this is the most difficult topic we're facing today / Because it's so close to the separation of church and state / And defining marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending anyone / So I don't know, I think / I think that all civil unions / I don't know whether marriage should be viewed / And / Defined by the government / Since it's considered a sacrament / So people wouldn't get tax breaks / Or be looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized / And / So if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union / Because that's what it is / It's two people / They shouldn't have separation of church and state / They shouldn't investigate what kind of marriage it was / Two people got together in a union / So / And / The fact that gay people get married / I mean / It's just / Two people who got into a civil union / \n\nWell, if all states come to a logical conclusion, they should try to make it federal law / But / A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous / It is / Something that shouldn't be changed in the constitution / I mean it's a very big issue for certain people / But / It's not large enough to be a constitutional amendment / It's just not important enough to change the constitution / To ban gay marriage / Simply put / \n\nUh / No",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian household, so homosexuality is a gray area for me. \n\nBecause \nI have many gay friends. \nI think I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. \nBut \nI think it should be legalized. \nI don't think it should be a national issue. \nHowever, I feel like it should be something each state decides for itself rather than \n\nLike \nMany states are democratic, \nAnd \nSome are Republican. \nObviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. \nAnd \nIf you live in a democratic state, \nIt's obvious how that state feels about that position. \nAnd \nI don't think you're necessarily in a position to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, \nBecause \nLike \nYou've chosen to live there \nYou know \nSo \nI think, \nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so \nI think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state \n\nWell, I kind of already answered that, \n\nYes, I don't think \nBush should decide that the whole nation should be against gay marriage \nI think it should be up to individual states whether they want to legalize it or not \nI don't agree with his ban on it \n\nI simply think that \nI don't think that \nBush doesn't live in every single state \nSo \nHe shouldn't decide how each state should govern itself \nI think that \nSome things should be left up to \nEach individual state \nPlus, he'll be out of office in about two years. \nAnd \nIf a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, \nLike \nIt will just go back and forth \nIt should just be up to each individual state \nBecause \nThey are the ones who will have to live with that decision \nNot the president \n\nNo, I don't",
            "I don't think so at all / I don't think so. Let's see, I think that Myspace is a public thing. And a bulletin. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know, that's basically to post for the public to see or others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now, if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it be school officials or not. In my opinion, I feel like the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But, uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Let me see here, like, if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing things they're not supposed to be doing, they go there just specifically to catch students and to get them in trouble, and I feel like that's an invasion of privacy. But I feel like, you know, as long as they save you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYeah, okay, well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. Alright, well, like I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid someone will pick that up and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and you know, it bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nLike, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will, like, find an email that you sent somehow, and once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't think it wasn't an invasion of privacy at all because, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying, it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here. \n\nLike I had said before, I don't feel like they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel like that's perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place. I had actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they said, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lock downs and stuff, and that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because, uh, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. Uh no, that's about it.",
            "At first I was for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven \nI was all for going over there and pretty much causing as much chaos as they did over here, but I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run \nI think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we went in there with our emotions and anger, and that’s what we created over there \nI don’t think we had a clear plan or goal when we went in, and we didn’t know what we were gonna face over there \nWe definitely didn’t know what we were doing, and it’s also bad because war is a very different thing for them compared to us \nThey’re like savages when it comes to war and I don’t think they’re looking to better their country, they just want us to leave \nI think we should just leave and that’s it \nI think we were just more emotional about it than anything, we weren’t thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle \nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just declared war on Iraq because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened \nBut at the time I saw where he was coming from, we really didn’t have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say, 'Let’s rebuild and that’s it' \nI don’t think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do, we just didn’t know what we were doing \nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order, and there was no unity, they didn’t know what they were going in there for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that’s what we created in turn over there \nHonestly I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people, I honestly think they’re always going to be like that \nI don’t think we’re making enough progress, we’ve made some progress but not enough to stay in there, and I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave it’s just gonna collapse, and we can’t stay over there forever \nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there"

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways, their views. Many people have talked about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of many things. In the case of gay marriages, in the case of abortion, in the case of birth control, such things. I think the Catholic Church has very strong views on them, which is fine, but they have somewhat old-fashioned views in some ways. So I think if they would adapt to maybe a bit newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church a bit because of their view on these situations. And many people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. So I feel that they feel the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things. Yeah, I mean the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you are for abortion, you might not be happy in a community where that is taught as completely wrong and you are against it. I mean the same with gay marriages and such things, where if you believe in them and want to do them or even just feel strongly about them, you might not want to be in a community where they don't agree with that. I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or priests who are married. But I don't know if that would necessarily have prevented what happened. I mean I don't know, I don't know if they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don't know if that would have necessarily changed it. I mean that was something they did, and that was something that didn't really seem to be affected. I mean if they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to really tell. Yeah, I mean I don't see why priests can't be married. The Catholic Church says that priests are basically married to God and are devoted to their life, but I don't see why everyone else who has a job can't have a family life and the other people they love, so I don't see why priests can't have both. No.",
            "I personally think I'm not opposed to marriage, I think that people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation or whatever. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't really. I haven't really put a lot of thought into the topic, but I would definitely say it's wrong. \n\nIt seems that it's not so much like a choice, like they don't really have a choice on how they are. I mean, I was born straight and another person is born gay, I guess. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. \n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved because it's nothing involving the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interfere in people's lives. And that's just who they are - gay people, that's just how they were born or at least that's what I think. And I mean, they shouldn't be punished for that. \n\nUh, no, that's it.",
            "I think that same-sex marriage should be legalized because, well, there's just not a good reason not to. Because many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but that's just so different, and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. And there are so many civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick, and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand how people like Catholics can get hung up on \"oh, well, that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing,\" but in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not a marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yes, they are, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues, and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation choices or not, but well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very strong views of his own to do with his religion. Well, his take on gay marriage actually um is I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which um I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect and that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "At first, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties.

But for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes because just because a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial.

You should acknowledge its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nAt first, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol because marijuana, if you abuse it, it's not as bad as alcohol, although if you abuse alcohol, it can lead to bad things. At first, I'd say no, you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused, but if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly.\n\nUh, yeah, at first, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug.

            "I was talking about how I feel about the war in Iraq. I feel it's kind of pointless because it's not even an officially declared war. I think it was just a revenge thing against Iraq because we thought they were behind the 9/11 attacks. Like, who was responsible? I'm not a big war opponent against the Iraq war, I don't keep up with it and I don't know the details. But at this point, I know we're just staying there to build a system that can slowly develop into a democracy, and we also want their oil and resources. But it's no reason to stay there because it just creates more trouble. And then if we stay there, we'll have to try and build a democracy, which will take forever because democracy can't be created overnight. And then if we leave, they'll be angry with us because we've messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. Let me think. Oh, this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. \n\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but I think the only reason we use guns and stuff is just to show that we're big and American and have all these big guns. But I don't think there's a huge reason for us to keep calling it a war anymore because we didn't even declare it as a war by Congress. I think that's how it works, you have to declare a war by Congress and then it's official. I just don't think it's a big point to still stay there and try. But I do think it's a point to stay there and try to help them, but it's also like wasting our resources. And right now, I feel really bad for Bush because it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. because of what it's doing and how it's affecting the country. Remember, I think with the whole Vietnam thing, the Vietnam War was an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war and he's going to be called that president forever. So, I think it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families I know whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and I want it to keep going because I want them to be safe, you know. These people over there have lives too and we've kind of destroyed them because now we've taken away their homes and their schools and their communities and now they're just fighting against each other because of their different beliefs. But then again, it's like, it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there, we're going to be trying to mold them into a second United States, and that's going to make it even worse for them. And it's going to be like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even bigger and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even bigger because we're trying to change them and they've been under this totalitarian dictatorship for so long that it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years.",
            "I don't know, I don't think it's right for it to be legalized or for a state to even declare it as legal. I think it's really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state. It's clear, it's clear. I don't know, it's clearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone in the constitution. So, in terms of the people who want to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another. Because as we can see, most Catholics, Catholics are and Christians are really against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas. But I don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal and legal. Well, separation of church and state is pretty much a key aspect of the constitution and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they did plan on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just in contradiction to what's already been said and written there. And plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't think that's right at all in that aspect. No, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else if anything, it could possibly boost it, I think, by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nOkay, I'll start from the beginning. I think the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war \nBefore invading Iraq, and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but in reality, it had very little to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage over the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, and the invasion of Iraq began in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against the war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike, I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that the \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes they made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers died \n\nAnd that's \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing, they were removing the country's government, and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nFor the aftermath and the power vacuum and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States removed the Iraqi government and \n\nThey were trying to implement a democratic government, and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out the Communists \nAnd \nAnd support or implement \nImplement and support democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat wasn't going to be a clear-cut victory, like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there \nBecause there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens of the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think the government \nSo first of all, I think we shouldn't have gone to war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases, and \nBut if you do go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government wasn't as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worse \nAnd \nIf they didn't plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government, and \nI mean we're still there today, almost the end of 2006, and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying, and \nAnd they're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process, and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell, they weren't prepared themselves, but in a way tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a \nA short, successful stay in Iraq, and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive to believe it would be that way because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was a lot of tension and there was a civil war, and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do, and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell, that's \nNo, that's \nNo, that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat's \nWell, that was kind of my feeling, I guess, in the election \nLike the presidential election of 2004, when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote, and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what he started, and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there, we've been there for so long, how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones who took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life, so how can we abandon them now \nAbandon them so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to the end, but again, there's also the consideration of the astronomical number of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is too much to risk for \nFor a free, democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing this to all these other countries, and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil \nAnd this is where we get our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and resources, \nI mean because another one of the preconditions before going to war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd places like North Korea, we actually knew they had weapons of mass destruction, and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nUm \nI just hope it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "Okay, let's see. I'm for gay marriage, I've always been for it. It's a personal preference and something that's been proven to be biological rather than sociological, so people shouldn't have fewer rights just because something is not in their control. It's inhumane to do so. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. \n\nI don't think there's any reason for politics and government to be involved in this. It's not even on the state level, it's a personal level, it's a family level. You know in my neighborhood at home, there are probably two or three openly gay couples, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way as any other family would. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that with Bush trying to play God and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, it's ridiculous. \n\nYeah, sure. I mean I think I've read and heard from various publications and TV reports or newspapers that it's something chemical in the brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be homosexual. In contrast to growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother, you know you don't have a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side rather than sociological.\n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that you know in this, I think maybe because marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can without telling a single person run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to be on the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's kinda the type of thing it should be a personal, private, sector type thing rather than public domain and national or federal domain. \n\nNo, no",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum, it's completely public, you can't.  I mean as an RA, it's something that I've already had to deal with.  When you put something out there, it's going to color people's opinions of you, and if you're talking about blowing things up or if you're talking about shootings, someone's going to say something.  You can't put that out there, put that out to the world.  The internet is seen by everyone.  If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin.  Obviously it wasn't the school that got the bulletin, someone went to the school and they have to act on it.  They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something does happen, they could have prevented it.  [Right]  But again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just make jokes about it. I mean it could be like the situation we had at school, it could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class, sorry I couldn't remember the word for a minute.  And it could also be something very serious.  I think.  What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got very worried because there were some certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke.  But in light of the situation became very serious.  When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens.  If you don't want it out there, don't put it there.  If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think.  You can't tell people what to take seriously or not.  I mean I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them.  And going through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals.  But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it.  And if there's danger they have to take it seriously.  I mean like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IM's and.  If it's brought to their attention then it's something completely different.  Um, yeah don't, like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing.  It's not my place, I don't even want that connection there.  Um, not really",
            "I think the war has been dragging on for too long. I think the purpose was good in the beginning. To restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since forgotten the purpose. And we're now maybe just doing it to prove something, to show that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I also think the original motives were questionable when dealing with George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. So I think, I think the original motivation, if it was to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would have been a fair motivation. If there were personal matters in it, I don't think it would have been fair. But I think it's been dragging on. I think we made our point in the first couple of months, starting the war. I think that was in itself an explanation. But the fact that it's gone on for over a year, several years, I think it's dragged on too long. Yeah, I think, I mean if our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just cause. And that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think, I think our reasons have been eroded and misconceived over time. And it seems like we're still at war just because we want to be at war. And we don't want to come out of this thing without a clear victory or a success. Yeah, I think that it's gone on long enough. And it should stop. I mean, there's a point when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on something, as we have our own wars on our own turf, like poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out. Yeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars. And war shouldn't be in our budget for the long term. There are things like poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems, funding things like that, healthcare, that I think that money could be better spent on. Right now, that money is being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country, in a war that we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",
            "I'd like to clarify a question.\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like\n\nOkay, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like MySpace, if I mean if you post information online, it's pretty much available to everyone. And I understand on MySpace, you know, you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile. You might need to be their friend or something like that. If that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean anytime you put information online, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So, I think it was good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um, that's tough. Because I mean, obviously, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So, I don't really know.\n\nSure, um, well, like, I mean, I don't have a MySpace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just tried to prove how easily he could get information. And he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name in under a minute and was talking to her on instant messenger. In less than a minute, and I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I've had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never really know who can look at what.\n\nHum, um, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having MySpace by the school, and I found that a little strange, like I wasn't sure how school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have a MySpace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people. That's the only other thought I could think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm \nWell, we only have this and then another time I have to talk about the Iraq War \nUh \nYeah \nI mean I feel hypocritical talking about it \nI mean I hate to say you know \nI hate to join the bandwagon of people who are like \"I was against it from the beginning\" \nBut I was, but it's not really important anymore \nBecause the general consensus everywhere is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit that they were wrong \nAnd uh \nI mean you just have to look at the recent polls \nUh \nThey've done US polls \nThey've done Iraqi polls \nThey've done global polls \nAnd I mean not \nAbout 75 to 80 percent of the world's population thinks that it was a bad idea \n80 percent of Iraqis \nUh \n70 percent of the troops that are over there \nLike the US troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year \nUh \nI don't know \nIt's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in \nIt was already a disaster \nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster \nThere's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore \nUh \nI mean I think it's just \nThe culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states \nI mean it's just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations \nAnd they think that they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist \nLike that's not the way that \nUh \nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives \nI mean sure Saddam was a bad guy \nI don't think anyone's like arguing that he's not \nBut, I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to \nYou know turn into just a complete disaster \nJust like quicksand from when we went over there \nUh \nI don't even know what to say about it \nUh \nI don't really see a reason at all to stay in there \nUh \nI mean I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there \nUh \nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out \nI don't agree with them \nI've yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should \nUh \nI mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year \nUh \nI guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that \nBut, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now \nUh \nI mean I read this statistic a little while ago that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now \nAnd like these \nThese are the people that we're trying to save like that we're trying to help \nTelling us to leave \nUh \nYou know I think they might know better than that \nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it's not on us if something happens \nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to \nUh \nAnd then you know at least we'll \nI mean if we decide to help out after that we'll at least be the good guys \nKind of \nNot really, no \nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East \nBut, you know \nIt'll be better than you know where we are \nWhere we stand right now \nUh \nYeah \nUh \nNo",
            "Yes, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. \nAnd it \nNot just with women, but \nI think it has to do with the specific field or type of work one does. \nI mean, in general, I think women have it harder because there's the so-called \"glass ceiling\" where even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time finding someone to put in a position of authority if they're a woman, just because society has been raised this way \nOnly because of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd often in the workplace, women see that there's a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't choose to promote them to that position because historically, it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world \nAnd I \nI think the same thing applies to men \nAnd in other industries like fashion or \nIf someone stays home to take care of the kids \nThat's really uncommon \nUm \nMen who stay home are often looked down upon because society thinks that they, the man, should be working \nHe should be the breadwinner of the family \nWhy is he staying home? \nAnd it can be really tough for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the kids and help raise them, and maybe the woman has a better position \nAnd it's working out fine for them \nBut society looks down on that \nAnd in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of people don't take straight men seriously \nI don't know if that really makes sense \nBut I think it's because typically, men who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I think have different lifestyles \nAnd if you have a typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, wait, how can I really know if you know what fashion is if you're caring for a woman \nHow can you know what our situation is if you're talking to these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on the field you're in \nI think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nAnd it's hard to change because \nSociety has a pre-programmed mindset, and obviously, we've developed a lot since the 1800s, leaps and bounds \nBut change is slow, so I think we should continue at our pace because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process \nAnd it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd when men stay home to take care of the kids \nThen it's also accepted because they realize, oh wait, maybe the woman has a better position, or she wants to be the one working \nAnd so \nThen people are like, okay, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and so they know where I'm coming from \nAnd so you have to promote it in a way by highlighting the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped against \nBut not too pushy \nBut by saying the qualities of them \nBecause if you do it too fast, people will resist \nAnd I think we're on a good path where it's slowly becoming accepted \nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist \nAnd we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nPeople are probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from \nIf you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO position \nEven though you may not have the best grammar in the world \nOr even though you may be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world \nOther men will look down on you and be like, wait, how can I know if you really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYes \nSo sometimes, just where you're from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don't know \nI think that'd be another example \nUm \nNot really",
            "Okay, \n\nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nSwitching \nWhich brought it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo a kind of traffic offense \nOne knows that one will be cited for rather than being taken in and arrested and jailed and all that \nSwitching \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited for it, then one knows, for the purposes of job interviews and all these things like that \nSwitching \nThese types of consequences, which are usually like the worst consequences of a drug offense would \nI mean usually the worst consequences of a drug offense, depending on the offense \nAt least in the case of a marijuana charge \nSomething that many kids worry about, many people worry about are the future consequences and these don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and bring them in and book them \nAnd to put them in custody and then to release them \nAnd it costs a lot to have them come to court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd to appoint a public defender \nAnd to pay the judge and then the prosecutor’s office has to take up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of these things cost a lot of money \nAnd switching \nI mean so \nWhen you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean many of them are philosophically not willing to make this kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for them \nLike many communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a city like Denver, where people tend to be more open and liberal \nLike I have to say \nA kind of thought structure \nThen I think it’s completely fine \nAnd I’m sure that the municipality has a lot more money that they can spend on public education, on social programs for the elderly, and on \nOne knows what I mean \nFood programs for the homeless \nSwitching \nI mean I think that’s \nIt’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that just wants to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and so on \nSwitching \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s also a financial aspect to it \nOther reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell if it were completely legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes, sell it in gas stations and people would smoke it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess many people would smoke and drive \nAnd switching \nIt’s still taboo in our society \nIn many places and contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana openly \nFor me it would just be awkward for many people \nSwitching \nAnd \nSorry, what? \nThe volume on the microphone is a bit low \nSwitching \nI don’t really know \nI think generally alcohol has more significant effects on motor skills \nSwitching \nBut I think marijuana has a greater influence on people’s lifestyle \nIn contrast to their decision-making and motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean if it comes to substances in general \nLike not two people react the same way \nI mean and then there are people with normal personalities and they just go all in with everything they have \nAnd then there are people who know how to exercise moderation and then there are people who can’t \nSo \nI think that makes it very difficult to speak generally about substances \nWhen people react differently \nBut I think they both have their own adverse effects \nSwitching \nYes \nUh \nNo, I’m not",
            "I would say yes because a lot of the things they do are very traditional like they've been doing the same things for long periods of time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done and sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions like for example my mom was an Episcopalian no I'm sorry my dad was an Episcopalian my mom was a Catholic and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion and that's not really being tolerant of other religions we always learned to love others that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that so I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway I don't think that would necessarily influence it I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm it might but I probably don't think that that would be an issue well I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening I think that would probably happen regardless nope",
            "I'm not sure about this matter yet / I haven't made up my mind yet on this issue / I don't know if one side is right or wrong / However, I think this is the most difficult topic we're facing today / Because it's so close to the separation of church and state / And defining marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending anyone / So I don't know, I think / I think that all civil unions / I don't know whether marriage should be viewed / And / Defined by the government / Since it's considered a sacrament / So people wouldn't get tax breaks / Or be looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized / And / So if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union / Because that's what it is / It's two people / They shouldn't have separation of church and state / They shouldn't investigate what kind of marriage it was / Two people got together in a union / So / And / The fact that gay people get married / I mean / It's just / Two people who got into a civil union / \n\nWell, if all states come to a logical conclusion, they should try to make it federal law / But / A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous / It is / Something that shouldn't be changed in the constitution / I mean it's a very big issue for certain people / But / It's not large enough to be a constitutional amendment / It's just not important enough to change the constitution / To ban gay marriage / Simply put / \n\nUh / No",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian household, so homosexuality is a gray area for me. \n\nBecause \nI have many gay friends. \nI think I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. \nBut \nI think it should be legalized. \nI don't think it should be a national issue. \nHowever, I feel like it should be something each state decides for itself rather than \n\nLike \nMany states are democratic, \nAnd \nSome are Republican. \nObviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. \nAnd \nIf you live in a democratic state, \nIt's obvious how that state feels about that position. \nAnd \nI don't think you're necessarily in a position to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, \nBecause \nLike \nYou've chosen to live there \nYou know \nSo \nI think, \nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so \nI think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state \n\nWell, I kind of already answered that, \n\nYes, I don't think \nBush should decide that the whole nation should be against gay marriage \nI think it should be up to individual states whether they want to legalize it or not \nI don't agree with his ban on it \n\nI simply think that \nI don't think that \nBush doesn't live in every single state \nSo \nHe shouldn't decide how each state should govern itself \nI think that \nSome things should be left up to \nEach individual state \nPlus, he'll be out of office in about two years. \nAnd \nIf a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, \nLike \nIt will just go back and forth \nIt should just be up to each individual state \nBecause \nThey are the ones who will have to live with that decision \nNot the president \n\nNo, I don't",
            "I don't think so at all / I don't think so. Let's see, I think that Myspace is a public thing. And a bulletin. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know, that's basically to post for the public to see or others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now, if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it be school officials or not. In my opinion, I feel like the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But, uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Let me see here, like, if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing things they're not supposed to be doing, they go there just specifically to catch students and to get them in trouble, and I feel like that's an invasion of privacy. But I feel like, you know, as long as they save you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYeah, okay, well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. Alright, well, like I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid someone will pick that up and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and you know, it bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nLike, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will, like, find an email that you sent somehow, and once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't think it wasn't an invasion of privacy at all because, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying, it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here. \n\nLike I had said before, I don't feel like they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel like that's perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place. I had actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they said, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lock downs and stuff, and that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because, uh, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. Uh no, that's about it.",
            "At first I was for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven \nI was all for going over there and pretty much causing as much chaos as they did over here, but I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run \nI think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we went in there with our emotions and anger, and that’s what we created over there \nI don’t think we had a clear plan or goal when we went in, and we didn’t know what we were gonna face over there \nWe definitely didn’t know what we were doing, and it’s also bad because war is a very different thing for them compared to us \nThey’re like savages when it comes to war and I don’t think they’re looking to better their country, they just want us to leave \nI think we should just leave and that’s it \nI think we were just more emotional about it than anything, we weren’t thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle \nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just declared war on Iraq because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened \nBut at the time I saw where he was coming from, we really didn’t have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say, 'Let’s rebuild and that’s it' \nI don’t think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do, we just didn’t know what we were doing \nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order, and there was no unity, they didn’t know what they were going in there for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that’s what we created in turn over there \nHonestly I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people, I honestly think they’re always going to be like that \nI don’t think we’re making enough progress, we’ve made some progress but not enough to stay in there, and I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave it’s just gonna collapse, and we can’t stay over there forever \nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there"

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways, their views. Many people have talked about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of many things. In the case of gay marriages, in the case of abortion, in the case of birth control, such things. I think the Catholic Church has very strong views on them, which is fine, but they have somewhat old-fashioned views in some ways. So I think if they would adapt to maybe a bit newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church a bit because of their view on these situations. And many people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. So I feel that they feel the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things. Yeah, I mean the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you are for abortion, you might not be happy in a community where that is taught as completely wrong and you are against it. I mean the same with gay marriages and such things, where if you believe in them and want to do them or even just feel strongly about them, you might not want to be in a community where they don't agree with that. I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or priests who are married. But I don't know if that would necessarily have prevented what happened. I mean I don't know, I don't know if they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don't know if that would have necessarily changed it. I mean that was something they did, and that was something that didn't really seem to be affected. I mean if they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to really tell. Yeah, I mean I don't see why priests can't be married. The Catholic Church says that priests are basically married to God and are devoted to their life, but I don't see why everyone else who has a job can't have a family life and the other people they love, so I don't see why priests can't have both. No.",
            "I personally think I'm not opposed to marriage, I think that people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation or whatever. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't really. I haven't really put a lot of thought into the topic, but I would definitely say it's wrong. \n\nIt seems that it's not so much like a choice, like they don't really have a choice on how they are. I mean, I was born straight and another person is born gay, I guess. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. \n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved because it's nothing involving the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interfere in people's lives. And that's just who they are - gay people, that's just how they were born or at least that's what I think. And I mean, they shouldn't be punished for that. \n\nUh, no, that's it.",
            "I think that same-sex marriage should be legalized because, well, there's just not a good reason not to. Because many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but that's just so different, and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. And there are so many civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick, and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand how people like Catholics can get hung up on \"oh, well, that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing,\" but in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not a marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yes, they are, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues, and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation choices or not, but well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very strong views of his own to do with his religion. Well, his take on gay marriage actually um is I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which um I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect and that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "At first, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties.

But for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes because just because a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial.

You should acknowledge its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nAt first, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol because marijuana, if you abuse it, it's not as bad as alcohol, although if you abuse alcohol, it can lead to bad things. At first, I'd say no, you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused, but if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly.\n\nUh, yeah, at first, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug.

            "I was talking about how I feel about the war in Iraq. I feel it's kind of pointless because it's not even an officially declared war. I think it was just a revenge thing against Iraq because we thought they were behind the 9/11 attacks. Like, who was responsible? I'm not a big war opponent against the Iraq war, I don't keep up with it and I don't know the details. But at this point, I know we're just staying there to build a system that can slowly develop into a democracy, and we also want their oil and resources. But it's no reason to stay there because it just creates more trouble. And then if we stay there, we'll have to try and build a democracy, which will take forever because democracy can't be created overnight. And then if we leave, they'll be angry with us because we've messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. Let me think. Oh, this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. \n\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but I think the only reason we use guns and stuff is just to show that we're big and American and have all these big guns. But I don't think there's a huge reason for us to keep calling it a war anymore because we didn't even declare it as a war by Congress. I think that's how it works, you have to declare a war by Congress and then it's official. I just don't think it's a big point to still stay there and try. But I do think it's a point to stay there and try to help them, but it's also like wasting our resources. And right now, I feel really bad for Bush because it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. because of what it's doing and how it's affecting the country. Remember, I think with the whole Vietnam thing, the Vietnam War was an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war and he's going to be called that president forever. So, I think it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families I know whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and I want it to keep going because I want them to be safe, you know. These people over there have lives too and we've kind of destroyed them because now we've taken away their homes and their schools and their communities and now they're just fighting against each other because of their different beliefs. But then again, it's like, it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there, we're going to be trying to mold them into a second United States, and that's going to make it even worse for them. And it's going to be like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even bigger and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even bigger because we're trying to change them and they've been under this totalitarian dictatorship for so long that it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years.",
            "I don't know, I don't think it's right for it to be legalized or for a state to even declare it as legal. I think it's really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state. It's clear, it's clear. I don't know, it's clearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone in the constitution. So, in terms of the people who want to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another. Because as we can see, most Catholics, Catholics are and Christians are really against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas. But I don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal and legal. Well, separation of church and state is pretty much a key aspect of the constitution and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they did plan on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just in contradiction to what's already been said and written there. And plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't think that's right at all in that aspect. No, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else if anything, it could possibly boost it, I think, by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nOkay, I'll start from the beginning. I think the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war \nBefore invading Iraq, and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but in reality, it had very little to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage over the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, and the invasion of Iraq began in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against the war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike, I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that the \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes they made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers died \n\nAnd that's \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing, they were removing the country's government, and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nFor the aftermath and the power vacuum and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States removed the Iraqi government and \n\nThey were trying to implement a democratic government, and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out the Communists \nAnd \nAnd support or implement \nImplement and support democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat wasn't going to be a clear-cut victory, like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there \nBecause there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens of the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think the government \nSo first of all, I think we shouldn't have gone to war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases, and \nBut if you do go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government wasn't as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worse \nAnd \nIf they didn't plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government, and \nI mean we're still there today, almost the end of 2006, and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying, and \nAnd they're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process, and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell, they weren't prepared themselves, but in a way tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a \nA short, successful stay in Iraq, and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive to believe it would be that way because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was a lot of tension and there was a civil war, and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do, and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell, that's \nNo, that's \nNo, that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat's \nWell, that was kind of my feeling, I guess, in the election \nLike the presidential election of 2004, when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote, and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what he started, and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there, we've been there for so long, how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones who took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life, so how can we abandon them now \nAbandon them so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to the end, but again, there's also the consideration of the astronomical number of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is too much to risk for \nFor a free, democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing this to all these other countries, and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil \nAnd this is where we get our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and resources, \nI mean because another one of the preconditions before going to war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd places like North Korea, we actually knew they had weapons of mass destruction, and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nUm \nI just hope it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "Okay, let's see. I'm for gay marriage, I've always been for it. It's a personal preference and something that's been proven to be biological rather than sociological, so people shouldn't have fewer rights just because something is not in their control. It's inhumane to do so. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. \n\nI don't think there's any reason for politics and government to be involved in this. It's not even on the state level, it's a personal level, it's a family level. You know in my neighborhood at home, there are probably two or three openly gay couples, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way as any other family would. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that with Bush trying to play God and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, it's ridiculous. \n\nYeah, sure. I mean I think I've read and heard from various publications and TV reports or newspapers that it's something chemical in the brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be homosexual. In contrast to growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother, you know you don't have a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side rather than sociological.\n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that you know in this, I think maybe because marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can without telling a single person run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to be on the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's kinda the type of thing it should be a personal, private, sector type thing rather than public domain and national or federal domain. \n\nNo, no",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum, it's completely public, you can't.  I mean as an RA, it's something that I've already had to deal with.  When you put something out there, it's going to color people's opinions of you, and if you're talking about blowing things up or if you're talking about shootings, someone's going to say something.  You can't put that out there, put that out to the world.  The internet is seen by everyone.  If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin.  Obviously it wasn't the school that got the bulletin, someone went to the school and they have to act on it.  They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something does happen, they could have prevented it.  [Right]  But again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just make jokes about it. I mean it could be like the situation we had at school, it could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class, sorry I couldn't remember the word for a minute.  And it could also be something very serious.  I think.  What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got very worried because there were some certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke.  But in light of the situation became very serious.  When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens.  If you don't want it out there, don't put it there.  If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think.  You can't tell people what to take seriously or not.  I mean I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them.  And going through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals.  But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it.  And if there's danger they have to take it seriously.  I mean like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IM's and.  If it's brought to their attention then it's something completely different.  Um, yeah don't, like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing.  It's not my place, I don't even want that connection there.  Um, not really",
            "I think the war has been dragging on for too long. I think the purpose was good in the beginning. To restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since forgotten the purpose. And we're now maybe just doing it to prove something, to show that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I also think the original motives were questionable when dealing with George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. So I think, I think the original motivation, if it was to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would have been a fair motivation. If there were personal matters in it, I don't think it would have been fair. But I think it's been dragging on. I think we made our point in the first couple of months, starting the war. I think that was in itself an explanation. But the fact that it's gone on for over a year, several years, I think it's dragged on too long. Yeah, I think, I mean if our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just cause. And that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think, I think our reasons have been eroded and misconceived over time. And it seems like we're still at war just because we want to be at war. And we don't want to come out of this thing without a clear victory or a success. Yeah, I think that it's gone on long enough. And it should stop. I mean, there's a point when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on something, as we have our own wars on our own turf, like poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out. Yeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars. And war shouldn't be in our budget for the long term. There are things like poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems, funding things like that, healthcare, that I think that money could be better spent on. Right now, that money is being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country, in a war that we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",
            "I'd like to clarify a question.\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like\n\nOkay, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like MySpace, if I mean if you post information online, it's pretty much available to everyone. And I understand on MySpace, you know, you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile. You might need to be their friend or something like that. If that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean anytime you put information online, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So, I think it was good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um, that's tough. Because I mean, obviously, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So, I don't really know.\n\nSure, um, well, like, I mean, I don't have a MySpace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just tried to prove how easily he could get information. And he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name in under a minute and was talking to her on instant messenger. In less than a minute, and I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I've had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never really know who can look at what.\n\nHum, um, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having MySpace by the school, and I found that a little strange, like I wasn't sure how school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have a MySpace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people. That's the only other thought I could think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm \nWell, we only have this and then another time I have to talk about the Iraq War \nUh \nYeah \nI mean I feel hypocritical talking about it \nI mean I hate to say you know \nI hate to join the bandwagon of people who are like \"I was against it from the beginning\" \nBut I was, but it's not really important anymore \nBecause the general consensus everywhere is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit that they were wrong \nAnd uh \nI mean you just have to look at the recent polls \nUh \nThey've done US polls \nThey've done Iraqi polls \nThey've done global polls \nAnd I mean not \nAbout 75 to 80 percent of the world's population thinks that it was a bad idea \n80 percent of Iraqis \nUh \n70 percent of the troops that are over there \nLike the US troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year \nUh \nI don't know \nIt's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in \nIt was already a disaster \nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster \nThere's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore \nUh \nI mean I think it's just \nThe culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states \nI mean it's just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations \nAnd they think that they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist \nLike that's not the way that \nUh \nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives \nI mean sure Saddam was a bad guy \nI don't think anyone's like arguing that he's not \nBut, I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to \nYou know turn into just a complete disaster \nJust like quicksand from when we went over there \nUh \nI don't even know what to say about it \nUh \nI don't really see a reason at all to stay in there \nUh \nI mean I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there \nUh \nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out \nI don't agree with them \nI've yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should \nUh \nI mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year \nUh \nI guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that \nBut, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now \nUh \nI mean I read this statistic a little while ago that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now \nAnd like these \nThese are the people that we're trying to save like that we're trying to help \nTelling us to leave \nUh \nYou know I think they might know better than that \nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it's not on us if something happens \nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to \nUh \nAnd then you know at least we'll \nI mean if we decide to help out after that we'll at least be the good guys \nKind of \nNot really, no \nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East \nBut, you know \nIt'll be better than you know where we are \nWhere we stand right now \nUh \nYeah \nUh \nNo",
            "Yes, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. \nAnd it \nNot just with women, but \nI think it has to do with the specific field or type of work one does. \nI mean, in general, I think women have it harder because there's the so-called \"glass ceiling\" where even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time finding someone to put in a position of authority if they're a woman, just because society has been raised this way \nOnly because of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd often in the workplace, women see that there's a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't choose to promote them to that position because historically, it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world \nAnd I \nI think the same thing applies to men \nAnd in other industries like fashion or \nIf someone stays home to take care of the kids \nThat's really uncommon \nUm \nMen who stay home are often looked down upon because society thinks that they, the man, should be working \nHe should be the breadwinner of the family \nWhy is he staying home? \nAnd it can be really tough for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the kids and help raise them, and maybe the woman has a better position \nAnd it's working out fine for them \nBut society looks down on that \nAnd in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of people don't take straight men seriously \nI don't know if that really makes sense \nBut I think it's because typically, men who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I think have different lifestyles \nAnd if you have a typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, wait, how can I really know if you know what fashion is if you're caring for a woman \nHow can you know what our situation is if you're talking to these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on the field you're in \nI think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nAnd it's hard to change because \nSociety has a pre-programmed mindset, and obviously, we've developed a lot since the 1800s, leaps and bounds \nBut change is slow, so I think we should continue at our pace because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process \nAnd it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd when men stay home to take care of the kids \nThen it's also accepted because they realize, oh wait, maybe the woman has a better position, or she wants to be the one working \nAnd so \nThen people are like, okay, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and so they know where I'm coming from \nAnd so you have to promote it in a way by highlighting the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped against \nBut not too pushy \nBut by saying the qualities of them \nBecause if you do it too fast, people will resist \nAnd I think we're on a good path where it's slowly becoming accepted \nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist \nAnd we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nPeople are probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from \nIf you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO position \nEven though you may not have the best grammar in the world \nOr even though you may be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world \nOther men will look down on you and be like, wait, how can I know if you really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYes \nSo sometimes, just where you're from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don't know \nI think that'd be another example \nUm \nNot really",
            "Okay, \n\nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nSwitching \nWhich brought it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo a kind of traffic offense \nOne knows that one will be cited for rather than being taken in and arrested and jailed and all that \nSwitching \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited for it, then one knows, for the purposes of job interviews and all these things like that \nSwitching \nThese types of consequences, which are usually like the worst consequences of a drug offense would \nI mean usually the worst consequences of a drug offense, depending on the offense \nAt least in the case of a marijuana charge \nSomething that many kids worry about, many people worry about are the future consequences and these don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and bring them in and book them \nAnd to put them in custody and then to release them \nAnd it costs a lot to have them come to court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd to appoint a public defender \nAnd to pay the judge and then the prosecutor’s office has to take up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of these things cost a lot of money \nAnd switching \nI mean so \nWhen you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean many of them are philosophically not willing to make this kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for them \nLike many communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a city like Denver, where people tend to be more open and liberal \nLike I have to say \nA kind of thought structure \nThen I think it’s completely fine \nAnd I’m sure that the municipality has a lot more money that they can spend on public education, on social programs for the elderly, and on \nOne knows what I mean \nFood programs for the homeless \nSwitching \nI mean I think that’s \nIt’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that just wants to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and so on \nSwitching \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s also a financial aspect to it \nOther reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell if it were completely legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes, sell it in gas stations and people would smoke it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess many people would smoke and drive \nAnd switching \nIt’s still taboo in our society \nIn many places and contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana openly \nFor me it would just be awkward for many people \nSwitching \nAnd \nSorry, what? \nThe volume on the microphone is a bit low \nSwitching \nI don’t really know \nI think generally alcohol has more significant effects on motor skills \nSwitching \nBut I think marijuana has a greater influence on people’s lifestyle \nIn contrast to their decision-making and motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean if it comes to substances in general \nLike not two people react the same way \nI mean and then there are people with normal personalities and they just go all in with everything they have \nAnd then there are people who know how to exercise moderation and then there are people who can’t \nSo \nI think that makes it very difficult to speak generally about substances \nWhen people react differently \nBut I think they both have their own adverse effects \nSwitching \nYes \nUh \nNo, I’m not",
            "I would say yes because a lot of the things they do are very traditional like they've been doing the same things for long periods of time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done and sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions like for example my mom was an Episcopalian no I'm sorry my dad was an Episcopalian my mom was a Catholic and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion and that's not really being tolerant of other religions we always learned to love others that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that so I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway I don't think that would necessarily influence it I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm it might but I probably don't think that that would be an issue well I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening I think that would probably happen regardless nope",
            "I'm not sure about this matter yet / I haven't made up my mind yet on this issue / I don't know if one side is right or wrong / However, I think this is the most difficult topic we're facing today / Because it's so close to the separation of church and state / And defining marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending anyone / So I don't know, I think / I think that all civil unions / I don't know whether marriage should be viewed / And / Defined by the government / Since it's considered a sacrament / So people wouldn't get tax breaks / Or be looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized / And / So if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union / Because that's what it is / It's two people / They shouldn't have separation of church and state / They shouldn't investigate what kind of marriage it was / Two people got together in a union / So / And / The fact that gay people get married / I mean / It's just / Two people who got into a civil union / \n\nWell, if all states come to a logical conclusion, they should try to make it federal law / But / A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous / It is / Something that shouldn't be changed in the constitution / I mean it's a very big issue for certain people / But / It's not large enough to be a constitutional amendment / It's just not important enough to change the constitution / To ban gay marriage / Simply put / \n\nUh / No",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian household, so homosexuality is a gray area for me. \n\nBecause \nI have many gay friends. \nI think I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. \nBut \nI think it should be legalized. \nI don't think it should be a national issue. \nHowever, I feel like it should be something each state decides for itself rather than \n\nLike \nMany states are democratic, \nAnd \nSome are Republican. \nObviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. \nAnd \nIf you live in a democratic state, \nIt's obvious how that state feels about that position. \nAnd \nI don't think you're necessarily in a position to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, \nBecause \nLike \nYou've chosen to live there \nYou know \nSo \nI think, \nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so \nI think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state \n\nWell, I kind of already answered that, \n\nYes, I don't think \nBush should decide that the whole nation should be against gay marriage \nI think it should be up to individual states whether they want to legalize it or not \nI don't agree with his ban on it \n\nI simply think that \nI don't think that \nBush doesn't live in every single state \nSo \nHe shouldn't decide how each state should govern itself \nI think that \nSome things should be left up to \nEach individual state \nPlus, he'll be out of office in about two years. \nAnd \nIf a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, \nLike \nIt will just go back and forth \nIt should just be up to each individual state \nBecause \nThey are the ones who will have to live with that decision \nNot the president \n\nNo, I don't",
            "I don't think so at all / I don't think so. Let's see, I think that Myspace is a public thing. And a bulletin. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know, that's basically to post for the public to see or others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now, if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it be school officials or not. In my opinion, I feel like the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But, uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Let me see here, like, if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing things they're not supposed to be doing, they go there just specifically to catch students and to get them in trouble, and I feel like that's an invasion of privacy. But I feel like, you know, as long as they save you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYeah, okay, well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. Alright, well, like I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid someone will pick that up and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and you know, it bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nLike, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will, like, find an email that you sent somehow, and once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't think it wasn't an invasion of privacy at all because, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying, it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here. \n\nLike I had said before, I don't feel like they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel like that's perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place. I had actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they said, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lock downs and stuff, and that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because, uh, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. Uh no, that's about it.",
            "At first I was for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven \nI was all for going over there and pretty much causing as much chaos as they did over here, but I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run \nI think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we went in there with our emotions and anger, and that’s what we created over there \nI don’t think we had a clear plan or goal when we went in, and we didn’t know what we were gonna face over there \nWe definitely didn’t know what we were doing, and it’s also bad because war is a very different thing for them compared to us \nThey’re like savages when it comes to war and I don’t think they’re looking to better their country, they just want us to leave \nI think we should just leave and that’s it \nI think we were just more emotional about it than anything, we weren’t thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle \nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just declared war on Iraq because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened \nBut at the time I saw where he was coming from, we really didn’t have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say, 'Let’s rebuild and that’s it' \nI don’t think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do, we just didn’t know what we were doing \nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order, and there was no unity, they didn’t know what they were going in there for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that’s what we created in turn over there \nHonestly I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people, I honestly think they’re always going to be like that \nI don’t think we’re making enough progress, we’ve made some progress but not enough to stay in there, and I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave it’s just gonna collapse, and we can’t stay over there forever \nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there"

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views on various issues seem outdated. Many people think the Catholic Church is losing influence because it's not very open to many things. They have strong views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can be a turn-off for some people. If they were to adapt to a newer way of thinking, they might not lose their following. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of how it views certain issues. The Catholic Church is against abortion, which can make it difficult for people who are pro-choice to be part of the community. The same goes for gay marriage and other similar issues. The Church's stance on these topics can be a major reason for people to leave. I don't see why priests can't be married or have female priests. The Church says that priests are \"married\" to God, but I don't think that's a valid reason for not allowing them to have a family life. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family life, so why can't priests?",
            "Personally, I'm not opposed to same-sex marriage. I think it's not a decision that people make consciously. So I think that gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really put much thought into the topic, but I think it's wrong to say that it's not okay.\n\nIt doesn't seem like they have a choice in how they are. I mean, I was born straight, and another person might be born gay. It doesn't seem like they make a conscious decision that they should be held responsible for.\n\nI think it's wrong for the federal government to get involved, as it's not a legal issue or a moral issue. I don't think these gay people should be put on a stage like they made a wrong decision or choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government really has any say in this matter. It's hard [laughs].\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, nor is it a moral concern. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interfere in people's lives, and they're just who they are. Gay people are who they were born to be, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn't a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's just different and there are so many different aspects that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin, heads will never be tails but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. A lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just, it's a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up on is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. If you're allowing someone a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. His take on gay marriage actually goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, a lot of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "First of all, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a medication is illegal, it doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. First of all, if we make it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a medication is illegal, it doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. It's not harmful. You know what I mean.\n\nYeah, first of all, I mean there are a lot of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, vicodin, percocet, that kind of thing, and those are controlled substances.

            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. \nI'm not as strict as I used to be. \nI know, even as I've grown older, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. \nAnd I would get cute little dresses. \nAnd matching shoes. \nAnd a matching purse. \nThat was what I always did. I went to a private school. \nAnd I would see my friends there on the weekends. \nAnd we would just go. \nBut now, as I've grown older, they've created like a youth mass. \nAnd they cut it down to 30 minutes. \nAnd people dress a lot more casually. \nEspecially in the summer people come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. \nYou have the families there who are just running late. \nSo I think it's become a lot more casual. \nEven at the morning masses, where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. \nThose are okay too. \nBut it's just a lot more casual than it used to be. \nAs for other things, \nThat's the biggest thing that I've noticed. \nThat's the church I know. \nI don't know the politics within the church and whatnot. \nBut yes, that's it. \n[OK, in regards to all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] \nI don't think these things could have been avoided. \nBecause \nThere are men who are married. \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles. \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction to young kids. \nSo \nI think even if you allowed them to get married, it's just the person, not because they're allowed to get married or not. \nI also think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. \nThere are religions that allow them to get married, where they could do so \nLike Seventh Heaven. \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something. \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey allow them to get married. \nSo \nI know it's a bit different. \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe think about a different faith. \n[OK, can you elaborate on your answer a bit more?] \nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nThe changes \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] \nOh, on pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nI think, \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality is before \nUm \nGenetics, I think it's based on genetics. \nI think people are born that way. \nI don't think it has anything to do with upbringing. \nIt might have a bit to do with this case \nBut \nI think it's their genetics. \nAnd \nYou can't hide that through a marriage. \nYou can try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out. \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. \nUm \nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them. \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew. \n[OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] \nUm no.",
            "(laughs) Initially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext; there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that the Bush administration early on connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq war just boils my blood. \n\nUm... It just seems to me that the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that, to me, is a form of malfeasance in office, I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution, and has been trying to marginalize it since September 11th at least, I mean. I think that they... Um... They came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nUm... That last part... I forget the name of the... Um... Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office... Um... But it seems to me that the younger Bush had a blood vendetta kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration, and I think that in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it’s gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war, and even more people would die as a result. Um... I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, coming in to try to restore order. But I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either, because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because... Um... Iraq’s sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue, there, because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Um... Oh, I can’t remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening in the country, and even Muktada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we’re still dealing with lots of radical elements that are vying for control of the government, and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm... (laughs) Not that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I was just going to talk into it? \nOkay, cool\nAch yeah\nAch\nOkay, I'm sorry\nOkay\nHow I feel about the war in Iraq\nLet me think\nUm\nAt this point I feel it's kind of pointless because it wasn't even declared a war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big revenge thing because we thought it was the Iraq who carried out the 9/11 attacks\nSo I don't feel like I'm a big fan of the war in Iraq\nSo I don't really follow it\nI don't know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we're just there to try and build democracy so it can become like another US thing\nAnd also so we can get oil and other resources from them\nBut it's no reason to stay there because it's just making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd if we stay there then what's going to happen is we have to try and build democracy which is going to take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day\nAnd then if we leave they're going to be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me think\nOh, this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don't know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh, this is hard\nAch\nHmm, I don't know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOkay\nThank you\nUm\nWell, um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair\nI don't think we should call it a war anymore\nBecause I don't think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we're big and American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore\nBecause we didn't even call it\nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it wasn't declared by congress\nI think that's how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it's\nI just don't think it's a big point to stay there and try\nActually no\nI do think it's a point to stay there and try to help them\nBut it's also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like\nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the US right now\nBecause of what it's doing and what it's doing to like\nRemember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nThe Vietnam War was an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war\nAnd he's like saying\nHe'll be called like that president forever\nBecause he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don't you?\nUh\nOkay yeah\nUm\nHm\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt's like\nIt's hard to say\nI want them to be there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it's going to be even worse for them\nAnd it's going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the US will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them\nAnd they've been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it's going to\nThat it's kind of hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat's about it\nOkay",
            "I don't know, I don't feel comfortable with it. It's not right that it's legalized or that a state even declares it legal. I think it's really up to the churches because in the constitution it says church and state are separated. It's clear, it's clear, I don't know. It's clearly stated and I think you should do anything to try to enforce any kind of power over it. Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution. So, in regards to the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think they are really picking one church over another. Because as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think it's really up to the state to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make legal. And legal.\n\nI don't know, well, the separation of church and state is almost a key aspect of the constitution, and what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States. And although they had planned on amending, I think even amending it would be completely wrong and in direct contradiction to what's already been said and written there. And I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that actually restricts the people rather than the government. So, I don't think it's right in that aspect.\n\nI don't know, no, I don't believe that the federal government or any government should get involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So, I really think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it I think by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\nMmm, not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay \nThe war in Iraq \nNow \nTo start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nAh \nI \nI myself am against the war and \nEspecially against a preemptive strike I was against that \nAh \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they made \n\nI mean \nA \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible and \nWhat they \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the country's government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nAh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nAh \nBecause there because there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to the end but again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is too much to continue risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue \nAnd this is where we get our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions was before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nAh \nI just hope that it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "I think we should see, I'm for gay marriage, I've always been. I really think it's a personal preference and it's something that's been proven more and more to be biological rather than sociological, instead of giving people fewer rights because of something they have no control over. I think it's quite inhumane and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think that politics and government in general should have anything to do with it, it's a personal matter, it's a household matter. I mean, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. I mean, they function just like any other family, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would and I think that Bush is trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, I think it's quite ridiculous.\n\nYeah, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from various different publications and TV reports or newspapers, it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be homosexual, as opposed to growing up with four sisters and being the only brother, and you know, not having a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side, as opposed to sociological.\n\nWell, other than the obvious, I think marriage is something that if a man and a woman want to do it, they can do it without telling a single person, run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's quite the type of thing that should be a personal, private, interpersonal matter, rather than in the public domain, in the national or federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "As an RA, I've already had to deal with this, when you put something on the internet, it becomes a public forum, it's completely public. You can't just post something that's going to color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there in the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get the bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin; someone went to the school and they had to act on it. They can't just let it sit there, then God forbid something happens and they could have prevented it. [Right] On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just mess around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. I apologize, I couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were certain things there that he may have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you post things into the public internet forum, there really is no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be befriending their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to their attention, then it's a completely different thing. Um, yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a fake Facebook or Myspace account and befriend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't befriend my residents because honestly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see it and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Um, not really.",
            "I think the war has been going on for too long. I think the purpose was good at first. To restore democracy in another country. But I think we've lost sight of that purpose and we're now maybe just doing it to prove we're some kind of superpower in the world. I think the original motivation, considering George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein, was questionable. So I think if the original purpose was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal matters involved, I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. I think we got our message across in the first couple of months after starting the war, I think that was a statement in itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year or several years, I just think it's gone on too long. \n\nYes, I think, I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. But I don't think our justification has been deteriorated and misleading over time. It seems like we're still at war just to be at war. And we don't want to come out of this thing without a clear end, without a victory or whatever. \n\nYes, I think it's been long enough and it should stop. I mean, there's a point in time when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We've been draining our own economy for too long, spending billions of dollars on wars on our own turf, such as poverty and whatnot, which we should be spending on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's been going on for too long. \n\nYes, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be a long-term goal in our budget. There are things like poverty or internal improvements, public roads or anything related to schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, which I think that money could be used better. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nI think that's it.",
            "I'd like to clarify a point that\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like that\n\nOkay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy, on platforms like Myspace if you post information on the internet it's almost like it's available to everyone. And I understand on Myspace, you know, in order to see someone's profile, you have to have someone else be a member, you have to add them as a friend or something like that, so if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it, you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you post information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think it was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's different profiles to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's just look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on the situation they came across that profile, or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just happened to see that, or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something, so I don't really know.\n\nYes, um, well, I mean, I personally don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook, I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just wanted to prove how easy it is to get information, and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away, and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I post, but at the same time, I think the whole point of having one is so you can communicate with some of your friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue, because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never really know who can see what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how the high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace, and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people what they could and couldn't do. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm, yeah, we only have this and then one more time to talk about the Iraq War. Yeah, I mean, I feel guilty talking about it, I mean, I hate to say, you know, that I was against it from the beginning, joining the bandwagon of people who are like, oh, I was against it from the start. I was, but it's not really important anymore, because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls, they've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and, I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops who are there, like the US troops who are there right now, think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in, it was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster, there's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states, I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration, or previous administrations, to understand, they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone is arguing that he isn't, but, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, just like quicksand when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them, I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that, but, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now, and like these, these are the people that we're trying to save, the people we're trying to help, telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that, and at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens, if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision to leave, and then you know at least we'll, I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we are now, where we stand.",
            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. And it's not just for women. I think it has to do with the specific field of work that one is in. I mean, in general, I feel that women have it harder because there's the \"glass ceiling\" where, even though it's supposed to be about equality, most people have a hard time finding someone to work under a woman if they're a man because the society has been raised for so long. And often, women in the workplace see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position because, historically, it's been shown that women are not usually in the upper levels of the business world. And I think the same thing goes for men. And in other fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really rare for a man to be at home. And often, people look down on that because society thinks, \"Oh, you're a man, you should be working. You should be the breadwinner of your family. Why are you staying at home?\" And it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has a better job, and it's working out fine for them. But society looks down on that. And in the fashion industry, often people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense. But I think it's because men who are typically into fashion... I think they have different lifestyles. And if a man has the typical lifestyle and is in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women? Like, you don't really know what our case is like? Like these other guys.\" And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of difficult because society has a fixed mindset and, obviously, we've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow. So, I think that if we continue to work at the pace we are now because women are advancing to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, but it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And similarly, as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, maybe the woman has a better job or she wants to be the one who works.\" And then for people in fashion, it'll be like, \"Oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and so they know where I'm coming from.\" So, I guess you have to kind of promote it by showing the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but showing the qualities of them. Because if you force it, people will resist. And I think we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So, I don't really know if there's anything we can do now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time. Yes. And I think they're also discriminated against each other, depending on the type of job you have or where you come from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't so good, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men will look down on you and be like, \"How do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, sometimes it's where you come from that discriminates against you, and from gender to gender. And I don't know, I think that would be another example. Not really.",
            "I mean they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it. But that made it from an offense to a traffic fine. You know what I mean, you get cited and you don’t have to get arrested and brought to jail and all that. But I think if someone gets caught and gets cited, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that. But there are arguments that it is expensive to arrest people and bring them in and to book them and then to let them go, and it costs a lot to bring them to court, maybe twice, maybe three times, and to appoint a public defender, and to pay the judge and the state attorney’s office has to take up the case and basically press the charges. I mean all these things cost a lot. And I mean if you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean many of them are philosophically not willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money. Like many communities are rightfully against marijuana and they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, to a certain extent, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for homeless people. But I think it’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want to have everywhere, all over the streets and stuff, but there’s a whole financial element to it as well, other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be that way. Well no, I mean I don’t know how I would feel about it, well if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, and I mean maybe a lot of people would say they’re smoking and driving, and it’s still a taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I find it awkward for a lot of people. But I think in general, alcohol has a much greater impact on your motor skills. But I think in general, marijuana has a more significant impact on people’s lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making skills. I mean but they both have their drawbacks. And I mean I think when it comes to substances in general, there are no two people who react the same way, I mean, and then there are people who have normal personalities and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then there are people who know how to exercise moderation, and then there are people who don’t, so it makes it really hard to make general statements about substances when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own drawbacks. But no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes, because a lot of things they do are very traditional, like they've done the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics, and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian, my dad was an Episcopalian, but my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them like that. So, I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine says you should do things, but the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. \n\nI don't think that would necessarily influence it; I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. It's just a different realm; it might be an issue, but I probably don't think that would be the case. Well, I guess people who molest children would probably do that regardless of whether they were married or not, because it's a child, which is different from a spouse. So, if you're going to do something like that, you'd probably do it whether you're married or not. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening; I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",
            "I'm not quite sure about this matter, I haven't made a decision,\nSo I can't say which side is right or wrong,\nBut I think that's the trickiest topic we're dealing with today,\nBecause the separation of church and state \nThe topic of marriage is something very difficult to define without offending anyone.\nSo I don't know, I think,\nI think that all civil unions \nShouldn't marriage be looked at \nAnd \nDefined by the government in the sense \nSince it is considered a sacrament \nOne wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr \nBe looked at in a certain way by the government if one was baptized,\nAnd \nSo \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause \nThat's what it is \nTwo people \nThey shouldn't have a separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't go into the question of what kind of marriage it was \nTwo people who got united in a partnership,\nSo \nAnd \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat would just be \nTwo people who entered into a civil union \n\nSo \nIf all the states come to a logical conclusion, then they should try to make it federal law.\nBut \nA constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is just absurd.\nIt is \nSomething that shouldn't be changed in the constitution,\nI mean, it's a very big issue for certain people,\nBut \nIt's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment.\n\nIt's not important enough to change the constitution,\nTo define \nTo ban same-sex marriage \nSimply put.\n\nNo",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a gray area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends. So I think that I don’t necessarily agree with this lifestyle. But I think it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue. However, I believe it should be something that each state decides for itself, instead of the President deciding for the whole country. \n\nLike many states are democratic, and some states are Republican. Obviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think you should disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. Because you kind of chose to live there, you know. So I think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. So I think it should be up to the decision of each state. \n\nWell, I kind of already answered that.\n\nI just don’t think that President Bush should decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just think that I don’t think that President Bush doesn’t live in every single state. So he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to govern itself. I don’t know what to do. So I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. And also, he will be out of office in about two years. And if a Democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should just be up to the decision of each individual state. Because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the President. No, I don’t.",
            "I think that \nNo, I don't know if \nI think, that's how I figure it \nMySpace is a public thing \nAnd \nA message \nYou know, if you look at that definition \nI think, then \nYou know, that's basically meaning to post something for the public to see or others to see \nOr whatever you're trying to get at \nAnd \nNow if you post that on the internet \nI think, you have to realize that others will see it \nWhether it be school officials or not \nI think, that school officials seeing that \nThey had every right to see it \nBecause \nEven if they weren't posting it under the school's name \nThey could have still accessed that \nThrough their homes \nI think it's good to do something that saves lives \nBecause \nAs long as the lives of students are in danger \nI think that's the responsibility of the school system \nI think that's okay \nI think if they go on the internet to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing things they're not supposed to be doing \nThey go there specifically to catch students \nAnd \nTo get them in trouble \nAnd \nI think that's an invasion of privacy \nBut \nI think, if they save lives \nOr make the school a better and safer place \nI don't think that's an invasion at all \nI think it's okay if they do that \n\nYeah, I think I should elaborate more on that \n\nYeah, I think it's easier to \nExpress yourself \nWhen you're writing \nBut \n\nYeah, that's okay \nI think it's a public thing \nAnd if a student posts something on MySpace \nAnd \nIsn't expecting to get in trouble \nThat's ridiculous \nI think that's everything \nI'm worried about posting stuff, even through emails \nI think I wouldn't say anything negative about someone \nBecause \nI'm afraid someone will find it \nAnd \nYou know, everything \nEverything comes back \nAnd \nYou know, it bites you, I guess you could say \n\nI think if you do something as a college student, then you'll grow up to be an important person \nAnd they'll find an email you sent \nAnd \nIf it's on the internet, it's still on the internet \nAnd \nI think if you do that, there's no way to avoid it \nYou'll get in trouble \nAnd \nI don't think that's an invasion of privacy \nBecause \nI said before that \nAnd \nThat's basically what I've been saying \nIt's a public thing \nAnd \nI think that's okay \nI don't know what else to say \n\nI said before, I don't think they should go on the internet to catch students \nBut \nIf they have something that leads them to make the school a safer place \nI think that's okay \nOr \nOther officials like the police to go on \nI think when parents drop off their kids at school, they feel safe \nI've actually discussed that with a \nMy teacher \nI went to a public high school \nAnd \nThey say, \nWe have to ensure that \nLike we would do a lockdown \nAnd \nThings \nAnd \nThat's in reference to the terrorist attacks \nWe had lockdown drills \nAnd \nWe got used to it \nAnd \nI think that has nothing to do with the \nI mean it has something to do with the school shooting \nBecause \nI think that's in case someone breaks into the building \nI think we \nWe practiced that \nTo make the school a safer place \nAnd \nThat's what the school officials did \nThey made it a safer place \nThey prevented something bad from happening \nLike Columbine or something like that \nI think that's all I can say \n\nThat's it, I think",
            "Okay, initially I was for it because I was personally affected by 9/11. \nAlso, I was for going back and basically creating as much chaos as they did here. \nHowever, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences because it was such an emotional event. \nAnd we just went there without being prepared and without a plan. \nAnd I think that backfired on us. \nI don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. \nI don't think it achieved anything. \nI think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. \nI don't think our presence there is going to make a difference if they can't even get along with themselves. \nIt's unfortunate, but due to 9/11, I'm almost indifferent to what happens over there. \nI just don't care about those people. \nI just think they're not human sometimes. \nI don't know, they fight with each other and can't do anything themselves. \nSo, I really don't care. \nI don't know, we definitely went there unprepared. \nWe didn't know what to expect over there. \nIt's also bad because war is viewed very differently over there than it is here. \nThey're just savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're interested in improving their country. \nI just think they want us out of there. \nAnd I think that would be okay for us. \nI think we should just leave and that's it. \nI think we were just hyped up when we went there. \nI don't think we thought rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. \nI think we pretty much just went there seeking revenge and I think President Bush went there because the people wanted to go there because of 9/11. \nAlso, I think he took it upon himself to declare war on Iraq. \nBut at the time, I understand where he was coming from. \nWe really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, \"Let's rebuild and that's it.\" \nSo, I don't think we could have just left it. \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do in terms of creating order. \nI don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do. \nAnd I don't know, I just think they didn't have unity. \nThey didn't know what they were going in there for. \nSo, I think that would have helped us a lot more. \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. \nSo, that's what we created there. \nHonestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. \nHonestly, I think they're always going to be like that. \nAnd I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. \nIt's gone on for long enough. \nI don't think we're making enough progress. \nWe've made progress, but not enough to stay there. \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. \nAnd we can't stay there forever. \nSo, I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying there. \nNo, okay."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views on various issues seem outdated. Many people think the Catholic Church is losing influence because it's not very open to many things. They have strong views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can be a turn-off for some people. If they were to adapt to a newer way of thinking, they might not lose their following. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of how it views certain issues. The Catholic Church is against abortion, which can make it difficult for people who are pro-choice to be part of the community. The same goes for gay marriage and other similar issues. The Church's stance on these topics can be a major reason for people to leave. I don't see why priests can't be married or have female priests. The Church says that priests are \"married\" to God, but I don't think that's a valid reason for not allowing them to have a family life. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family life, so why can't priests?",
            "Personally, I'm not opposed to same-sex marriage. I think it's not a decision that people make consciously. So I think that gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really put much thought into the topic, but I think it's wrong to say that it's not okay.\n\nIt doesn't seem like they have a choice in how they are. I mean, I was born straight, and another person might be born gay. It doesn't seem like they make a conscious decision that they should be held responsible for.\n\nI think it's wrong for the federal government to get involved, as it's not a legal issue or a moral issue. I don't think these gay people should be put on a stage like they made a wrong decision or choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government really has any say in this matter. It's hard [laughs].\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, nor is it a moral concern. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interfere in people's lives, and they're just who they are. Gay people are who they were born to be, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn't a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's just different and there are so many different aspects that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin, heads will never be tails but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. A lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just, it's a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up on is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. If you're allowing someone a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. His take on gay marriage actually goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, a lot of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "First of all, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a medication is illegal, it doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. First of all, if we make it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a medication is illegal, it doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. It's not harmful. You know what I mean.\n\nYeah, first of all, I mean there are a lot of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, vicodin, percocet, that kind of thing, and those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial, and if you deny their benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should accept its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nFirst of all, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol, because marijuana, if you abuse it, it's... although if you abuse alcohol, it can lead to bad things too. First of all, I'd say no, you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once, because then it would be abused, but if you just... You have to remove the taboo surrounding marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly.\n\nUh, yeah, first of all, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But I mean, it's not that bad for you, it's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. First of all, I mean, if we get rid of the image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNo.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. \nI'm not as strict as I used to be. \nI know, even as I've grown older, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. \nAnd I would get cute little dresses. \nAnd matching shoes. \nAnd a matching purse. \nThat was what I always did. I went to a private school. \nAnd I would see my friends there on the weekends. \nAnd we would just go. \nBut now, as I've grown older, they've created like a youth mass. \nAnd they cut it down to 30 minutes. \nAnd people dress a lot more casually. \nEspecially in the summer people come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. \nYou have the families there who are just running late. \nSo I think it's become a lot more casual. \nEven at the morning masses, where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. \nThose are okay too. \nBut it's just a lot more casual than it used to be. \nAs for other things, \nThat's the biggest thing that I've noticed. \nThat's the church I know. \nI don't know the politics within the church and whatnot. \nBut yes, that's it. \n[OK, in regards to all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] \nI don't think these things could have been avoided. \nBecause \nThere are men who are married. \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles. \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction to young kids. \nSo \nI think even if you allowed them to get married, it's just the person, not because they're allowed to get married or not. \nI also think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. \nThere are religions that allow them to get married, where they could do so \nLike Seventh Heaven. \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something. \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey allow them to get married. \nSo \nI know it's a bit different. \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe think about a different faith. \n[OK, can you elaborate on your answer a bit more?] \nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nThe changes \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] \nOh, on pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nI think, \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality is before \nUm \nGenetics, I think it's based on genetics. \nI think people are born that way. \nI don't think it has anything to do with upbringing. \nIt might have a bit to do with this case \nBut \nI think it's their genetics. \nAnd \nYou can't hide that through a marriage. \nYou can try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out. \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. \nUm \nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them. \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew. \n[OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] \nUm no.",
            "(laughs) Initially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext; there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that the Bush administration early on connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq war just boils my blood. \n\nUm... It just seems to me that the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that, to me, is a form of malfeasance in office, I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution, and has been trying to marginalize it since September 11th at least, I mean. I think that they... Um... They came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nUm... That last part... I forget the name of the... Um... Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office... Um... But it seems to me that the younger Bush had a blood vendetta kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration, and I think that in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it’s gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war, and even more people would die as a result. Um... I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, coming in to try to restore order. But I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either, because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because... Um... Iraq’s sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue, there, because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Um... Oh, I can’t remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening in the country, and even Muktada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we’re still dealing with lots of radical elements that are vying for control of the government, and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm...

            "I don't know, I don't feel comfortable with it. It's not right that it's legalized or that a state even declares it legal. I think it's really up to the churches because in the constitution it says church and state are separated. It's clear, it's clear, I don't know. It's clearly stated and I think you should do anything to try to enforce any kind of power over it. Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution. So, in regards to the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think they are really picking one church over another. Because as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think it's really up to the state to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make legal. And legal.\n\nI don't know, well, the separation of church and state is almost a key aspect of the constitution, and what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States. And although they had planned on amending, I think even amending it would be completely wrong and in direct contradiction to what's already been said and written there. And I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that actually restricts the people rather than the government. So, I don't think it's right in that aspect.\n\nI don't know, no, I don't believe that the federal government or any government should get involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So, I really think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it I think by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\nMmm, not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay \nThe war in Iraq \nNow \nTo start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other

2003 \nAh \nI \nI myself am against the war and \nEspecially against a preemptive strike I was against that \nAh \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they made \n\nI mean \nA \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible and \nWhat they \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the country's government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nAh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nAh \nBecause there because there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to the end but again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is too much to continue risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue \nAnd this is where we get our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions was before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nAh \nI just hope that it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "I think we should see, I'm for gay marriage, I've always been. I really think it's a personal preference and it's something that's been proven more and more to be biological rather than sociological, instead of giving people fewer rights because of something they have no control over. I think it's quite inhumane and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think that politics and government in general should have anything to do with it, it's a personal matter, it's a household matter. I mean, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. I mean, they function just like any other family, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would and I think that Bush is trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, I think it's quite ridiculous.\n\nYeah, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from various different publications and TV reports or newspapers, it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be homosexual, as opposed to growing up with four sisters and being the only brother, and you know, not having a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side, as opposed to sociological.\n\nWell, other than the obvious, I think marriage is something that if a man and a woman want to do it, they can do it without telling a single person, run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's quite the type of thing that should be a personal, private, interpersonal matter, rather than in the public domain, in the national or federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "As an RA, I've already had to deal with this, when you put something on the internet, it becomes a public forum, it's completely public. You can't just post something that's going to color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there in the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get the bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin; someone went to the school and they had to act on it. They can't just let it sit there, then God forbid something happens and they could have prevented it. [Right] On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just mess around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. I apologize, I couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were certain things there that he may have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you post things into the public internet forum, there really is no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be befriending their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to their attention, then it's a completely different thing. Um, yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a fake Facebook or Myspace account and befriend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't befriend my residents because honestly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see it and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Um, not really.",
            "I think the war has been going on for too long. I think the purpose was good at first. To restore democracy in another country. But I think we've lost sight of that purpose and we're now maybe just doing it to prove we're some kind of superpower in the world. I think the original motivation, considering George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein, was questionable. So I think if the original purpose was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal matters involved, I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. I think we got our message across in the first couple of months after starting the war, I think that was a statement in itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year or several years, I just think it's gone on too long. \n\nYes, I think, I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. But I don't think our justification has been deteriorated and misleading over time. It seems like we're still at war just to be at war. And we don't want to come out of this thing without a clear end, without a victory or whatever. \n\nYes, I think it's been long enough and it should stop. I mean, there's a point in time when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We've been draining our own economy for too long, spending billions of dollars on wars on our own turf, such as poverty and whatnot, which we should be spending on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's been going on for too long. \n\nYes, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be a long-term goal in our budget. There are things like poverty or internal improvements, public roads or anything related to schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, which I think that money could be used better. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nI think that's it.",
            "I'd like to clarify a point that\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like that\n\nOkay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy, on platforms like Myspace if you post information on the internet it's almost like it's available to everyone. And I understand on Myspace, you know, in order to see someone's profile, you have to have someone else be a member, you have to add them as a friend or something like that, so if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it, you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you post information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think it was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's different profiles to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's just look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on the situation they came across that profile, or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just happened to see that, or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something, so I don't really know.\n\nYes, um, well, I mean, I personally don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook, I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just wanted to prove how easy it is to get information, and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away, and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I post, but at the same time, I think the whole point of having one is so you can communicate with some of your friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue, because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never really know who can see what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how the high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace, and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people what they could and couldn't do. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm, yeah, we only have this and then one more time to talk about the Iraq War. Yeah, I mean, I feel guilty talking about it, I mean, I hate to say, you know, that I was against it from the beginning, joining the bandwagon of people who are like, oh, I was against it from the start. I was, but it's not really important anymore, because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls, they've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and, I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops who are there, like the US troops who are there right now, think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in, it was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster, there's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states, I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration, or previous administrations, to understand, they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone is arguing that he isn't, but, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, just like quicksand when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them, I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that, but, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now, and like these, these are the people that we're trying to save, the people we're trying to help, telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that, and at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens, if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision to leave, and then you know at least we'll, I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we are now, where we stand.",
            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. And it's not just for women. I think it has to do with the specific field of work that one is in. I mean, in general, I feel that women have it harder because there's the \"glass ceiling\" where, even though it's supposed to be about equality, most people have a hard time finding someone to work under a woman if they're a man because the society has been raised for so long. And often, women in the workplace see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position because, historically, it's been shown that women are not usually in the upper levels of the business world. And I think the same thing goes for men. And in other fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really rare for a man to be at home. And often, people look down on that because society thinks, \"Oh, you're a man, you should be working. You should be the breadwinner of your family. Why are you staying at home?\" And it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has a better job, and it's working out fine for them. But society looks down on that. And in the fashion industry, often people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense. But I think it's because men who are typically into fashion... I think they have different lifestyles. And if a man has the typical lifestyle and is in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women? Like, you don't really know what our case is like? Like these other guys.\" And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of difficult because society has a fixed mindset and, obviously, we've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow. So, I think that if we continue to work at the pace we are now because women are advancing to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, but it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And similarly, as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, maybe the woman has a better job or she wants to be the one who works.\" And then for people in fashion, it'll be like, \"Oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and so they know where I'm coming from.\" So, I guess you have to kind of promote it by showing the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but showing the qualities of them. Because if you force it, people will resist. And I think we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So, I don't really know if there's anything we can do now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time. Yes. And I think they're also discriminated against each other, depending on the type of job you have or where you come from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't so good, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men will look down on you and be like, \"How do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, sometimes it's where you come from that discriminates against you, and from gender to gender. And I don't know, I think that would be another example. Not really.",
            "I mean they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it. But that made it from an offense to a traffic fine. You know what I mean, you get cited and you don’t have to get arrested and brought to jail and all that. But I think if someone gets caught and gets cited, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that. But there are arguments that it is expensive to arrest people and bring them in and to book them and then to let them go, and it costs a lot to bring them to court, maybe twice, maybe three times, and to appoint a public defender, and to pay the judge and the state attorney’s office has to take up the case and basically press the charges. I mean all these things cost a lot. And I mean if you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean many of them are philosophically not willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money. Like many communities are rightfully against marijuana and they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, to a certain extent, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for homeless people. But I think it’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want to have everywhere, all over the streets and stuff, but there’s a whole financial element to it as well, other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be that way. Well no, I mean I don’t know how I would feel about it, well if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, and I mean maybe a lot of people would say they’re smoking and driving, and it’s still a taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I find it awkward for a lot of people. But I think in general, alcohol has a much greater impact on your motor skills. But I think in general, marijuana has a more significant impact on people’s lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making skills. I mean but they both have their drawbacks. And I mean I think when it comes to substances in general, there are no two people who react the same way, I mean, and then there are people who have normal personalities and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then there are people who know how to exercise moderation, and then there are people who don’t, so it makes it really hard to make general statements about substances when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own drawbacks. But no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes, because a lot of things they do are very traditional, like they've done the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics, and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian, my dad was an Episcopalian, but my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them like that. So, I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine says you should do things, but the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. \n\nI don't think that would necessarily influence it; I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. It's just a different realm; it might be an issue, but I probably don't think that would be the case. Well, I guess people who molest children would probably do that regardless of whether they were married or not, because it's a child, which is different from a spouse. So, if you're going to do something like that, you'd probably do it whether you're married or not. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening; I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",
            "I'm not quite sure about this matter, I haven't made a decision,\nSo I can't say which side is right or wrong,\nBut I think that's the trickiest topic we're dealing with today,\nBecause the separation of church and state \nThe topic of marriage is something very difficult to define without offending anyone.\nSo I don't know, I think,\nI think that all civil unions \nShouldn't marriage be looked at \nAnd \nDefined by the government in the sense \nSince it is considered a sacrament \nOne wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr \nBe looked at in a certain way by the government if one was baptized,\nAnd \nSo \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause \nThat's what it is \nTwo people \nThey shouldn't have a separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't go into the question of what kind of marriage it was \nTwo people who got united in a partnership,\nSo \nAnd \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat would just be \nTwo people who entered into a civil union \n\nSo \nIf all the states come to a logical conclusion, then they should try to make it federal law.\nBut \nA constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is just absurd.\nIt is \nSomething that shouldn't be changed in the constitution,\nI mean, it's a very big issue for certain people,\nBut \nIt's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment.\n\nIt's not important enough to change the constitution,\nTo define \nTo ban same-sex marriage \nSimply put.\n\nNo",

However, I believe it should be something that each state decides for itself, instead of the President deciding for the whole country. \n\nLike many states are democratic, and some states are Republican. Obviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think you should disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. Because you kind of chose to live there, you know. So I think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. So I think it should be up to the decision of each state. \n\nWell, I kind of already answered that.\n\nI just don’t think that President Bush should decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just think that I don’t think that President Bush doesn’t live in every single state. So he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to govern itself. I don’t know what to do. So I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. And also, he will be out of office in about two years. And if a Democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should just be up to the decision of each individual state. Because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the President. No, I don’t.",
            "I think that \nNo, I don't know if \nI think, that's how I figure it \nMySpace is a public thing \nAnd \nA message \nYou know, if you look at that definition \nI think, then \nYou know, that's basically meaning to post something for the public to see or others to see \nOr whatever you're trying to get at \nAnd \nNow if you post that on the internet \nI think, you have to realize that others will see it \nWhether it be school officials or not \nI think, that school officials seeing that \nThey had every right to see it \nBecause \nEven if they weren't posting it under the school's name \nThey could have still accessed that \nThrough their homes \nI think it's good to do something that saves lives \nBecause \nAs long as the lives of students are in danger \nI think that's the responsibility of the school system \nI think that's okay \nI think if they go on the internet to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing things they're not supposed to be doing \nThey go there specifically to catch students \nAnd \nTo get them in trouble \nAnd \nI think that's an invasion of privacy \nBut \nI think, if they save lives \nOr make the school a better and safer place \nI don't think that's an invasion at all \nI think it's okay if they do that \n\nYeah, I think I should elaborate more on that \n\nYeah, I think it's easier to \nExpress yourself \nWhen you're writing \nBut \n\nYeah, that's okay \nI think it's a public thing \nAnd if a student posts something on MySpace \nAnd \nIsn't expecting to get in trouble \nThat's ridiculous \nI think that's everything \nI'm worried about posting stuff, even through emails \nI think I wouldn't say anything negative about someone \nBecause \nI'm afraid someone will find it \nAnd \nYou know, everything \nEverything comes back \nAnd \nYou know, it bites you, I guess you could say \n\nI think if you do something as a college student, then you'll grow up to be an important person \nAnd they'll find an email you sent \nAnd \nIf it's on the internet, it's still on the internet \nAnd \nI think if you do that, there's no way to avoid it \nYou'll get in trouble \nAnd \nI don't think that's an invasion of privacy \nBecause \nI said before that \nAnd \nThat's basically what I've been saying \nIt's a public thing \nAnd \nI think that's okay \nI don't know what else to say \n\nI said before, I don't think they should go on the internet to catch students \nBut \nIf they have something that leads them to make the school a safer place \nI think that's okay \nOr \nOther officials like the police to go on \nI think when parents drop off their kids at school, they feel safe \nI've actually discussed that with a \nMy teacher \nI went to a public high school \nAnd \nThey say, \nWe have to ensure that \nLike we would do a lockdown \nAnd \nThings \nAnd \nThat's in reference to the terrorist attacks \nWe had lockdown drills \nAnd \nWe got used to it \nAnd \nI think that has nothing to do with the \nI mean it has something to do with the school shooting \nBecause \nI think that's in case someone breaks into the building \nI think we \nWe practiced that \nTo make the school a safer place \nAnd \nThat's what the school officials did \nThey made it a safer place \nThey prevented something bad from happening \nLike Columbine or something like that \nI think that's all I can say \n\nThat's it, I think",
            "Okay, initially I was for it because I was personally affected by 9/11. \nAlso, I was for going back and basically creating as much chaos as they did here. \nHowever, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences because it was such an emotional event. \nAnd we just went there without being prepared and without a plan. \nAnd I think that backfired on us. \nI don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. \nI don't think it achieved anything. \nI think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. \nI don't think our presence there is going to make a difference if they can't even get along with themselves. \nIt's unfortunate, but due to 9/11, I'm almost indifferent to what happens over there. \nI just don't care about those people. \nI just think they're not human sometimes. \nI don't know, they fight with each other and can't do anything themselves. \nSo, I really don't care. \nI don't know, we definitely went there unprepared. \nWe didn't know what to expect over there. \nIt's also bad because war is viewed very differently over there than it is here. \nThey're just savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're interested in improving their country. \nI just think they want us out of there. \nAnd I think that would be okay for us. \nI think we should just leave and that's it. \nI think we were just hyped up when we went there. \nI don't think we thought rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. \nI think we pretty much just went there seeking revenge and I think President Bush went there because the people wanted to go there because of 9/11. \nAlso, I think he took it upon himself to declare war on Iraq. \nBut at the time, I understand where he was coming from. \nWe really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, \"Let's rebuild and that's it.\" \nSo, I don't think we could have just left it. \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do in terms of creating order. \nI don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do. \nAnd I don't know, I just think they didn't have unity. \nThey didn't know what they were going in there for. \nSo, I think that would have helped us a lot more. \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. \nSo, that's what we created there. \nHonestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. \nHonestly, I think they're always going to be like that. \nAnd I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. \nIt's gone on for long enough. \nI don't think we're making enough progress. \nWe've made progress, but not enough to stay there. \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. \nAnd we can't stay there forever. \nSo, I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying there. \nNo, okay."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views on various issues seem outdated. Many people think the Catholic Church is losing influence because it's not very open to many things. They have strong views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can be a turn-off for some people. If they were to adapt to a newer way of thinking, they might not lose their following. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of how it views certain issues. The Catholic Church is against abortion, which can make it difficult for people who are pro-choice to be part of the community. The same goes for gay marriage and other similar issues. The Church's stance on these topics can be a major reason for people to leave. I don't see why priests can't be married or have female priests. The Church says that priests are \"married\" to God, but I don't think that's a valid reason for not allowing them to have a family life. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family life, so why can't priests?",
            "Personally, I'm not opposed to same-sex marriage. I think it's not a decision that people make consciously. So I think that gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really put much thought into the topic, but I think it's wrong to say that it's not okay.\n\nIt doesn't seem like they have a choice in how they are. I mean, I was born straight, and another person might be born gay. It doesn't seem like they make a conscious decision that they should be held responsible for.\n\nI think it's wrong for the federal government to get involved, as it's not a legal issue or a moral issue. I don't think these gay people should be put on a stage like they made a wrong decision or choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government really has any say in this matter. It's hard [laughs].\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, nor is it a moral concern. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interfere in people's lives, and they're just who they are. Gay people are who they were born to be, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn't a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's just different and there are so many different aspects that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin, heads will never be tails but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. A lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just, it's a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up on is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. If you're allowing someone a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. His take on gay marriage actually goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, a lot of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "First of all, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a medication is illegal, it doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. First of all, if we make it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a medication is illegal, it doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. It's not harmful. You know what I mean.\n\nYeah, first of all, I mean there are a lot of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, vicodin, percocet, that kind of thing, and those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial, and if you deny their benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should accept its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nFirst of all, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol, because marijuana, if you abuse it, it's... although if you abuse alcohol, it can lead to bad things too. First of all, I'd say no, you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once, because then it would be abused, but if you just... You have to remove the taboo surrounding marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly.\n\nUh, yeah, first of all, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But I mean, it's not that bad for you, it's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. First of all, I mean, if we get rid of the image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNo.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. \nI'm not as strict as I used to be. \nI know, even as I've grown older, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. \nAnd I would get cute little dresses. \nAnd matching shoes. \nAnd a matching purse. \nThat was what I always did. I went to a private school. \nAnd I would see my friends there on the weekends. \nAnd we would just go. \nBut now, as I've grown older, they've created like a youth mass. \nAnd they cut it down to 30 minutes. \nAnd people dress a lot more casually. \nEspecially in the summer people come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. \nYou have the families there who are just running late. \nSo I think it's become a lot more casual. \nEven at the morning masses, where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. \nThose are okay too. \nBut it's just a lot more casual than it used to be. \nAs for other things, \nThat's the biggest thing that I've noticed. \nThat's the church I know. \nI don't know the politics within the church and whatnot. \nBut yes, that's it. \n[OK, in regards to all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] \nI don't think these things could have been avoided. \nBecause \nThere are men who are married. \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles. \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction to young kids. \nSo \nI think even if you allowed them to get married, it's just the person, not because they're allowed to get married or not. \nI also think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. \nThere are religions that allow them to get married, where they could do so \nLike Seventh Heaven. \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something. \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey allow them to get married. \nSo \nI know it's a bit different. \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe think about a different faith. \n[OK, can you elaborate on your answer a bit more?] \nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nThe changes \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] \nOh, on pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nI think, \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality is before \nUm \nGenetics, I think it's based on genetics. \nI think people are born that way. \nI don't think it has anything to do with upbringing. \nIt might have a bit to do with this case \nBut \nI think it's their genetics. \nAnd \nYou can't hide that through a marriage. \nYou can try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out. \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. \nUm \nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them. \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew. \n[OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] \nUm no.",
            "(laughs) Initially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext; there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that the Bush administration early on connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq war just boils my blood. \n\nUm... It just seems to me that the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that, to me, is a form of malfeasance in office, I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution, and has been trying to marginalize it since September 11th at least, I mean. I think that they... Um... They came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nUm... That last part... I forget the name of the... Um... Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office... Um... But it seems to me that the younger Bush had a blood vendetta kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration, and I think that in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it’s gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war, and even more people would die as a result. Um... I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, coming in to try to restore order. But I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either, because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because... Um... Iraq’s sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue, there, because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Um... Oh, I can’t remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening in the country, and even Muktada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we’re still dealing with lots of radical elements that are vying for control of the government, and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm...

            "I don't know, I don't feel comfortable with it. It's not right that it's legalized or that a state even declares it legal. I think it's really up to the churches because in the constitution it says church and state are separated. It's clear, it's clear, I don't know. It's clearly stated and I think you should do anything to try to enforce any kind of power over it. Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution. So, in regards to the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think they are really picking one church over another. Because as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think it's really up to the state to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make legal. And legal.\n\nI don't know, well, the separation of church and state is almost a key aspect of the constitution, and what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States. And although they had planned on amending, I think even amending it would be completely wrong and in direct contradiction to what's already been said and written there. And I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that actually restricts the people rather than the government. So, I don't think it's right in that aspect.\n\nI don't know, no, I don't believe that the federal government or any government should get involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So, I really think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it I think by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\nMmm, not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay \nThe war in Iraq \nNow \nTo start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other

2003 \nAh \nI \nI myself am against the war and \nEspecially against a preemptive strike I was against that \nAh \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they made \n\nI mean \nA \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible and \nWhat they \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the country's government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nAh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nAh \nBecause there because there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to the end but again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is too much to continue risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue \nAnd this is where we get our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions was before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nAh \nI just hope that it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "I think we should see, I'm for gay marriage, I've always been. I really think it's a personal preference and it's something that's been proven more and more to be biological rather than sociological, instead of giving people fewer rights because of something they have no control over. I think it's quite inhumane and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think that politics and government in general should have anything to do with it, it's a personal matter, it's a household matter. I mean, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. I mean, they function just like any other family, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would and I think that Bush is trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, I think it's quite ridiculous.\n\nYeah, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from various different publications and TV reports or newspapers, it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be homosexual, as opposed to growing up with four sisters and being the only brother, and you know, not having a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side, as opposed to sociological.\n\nWell, other than the obvious, I think marriage is something that if a man and a woman want to do it, they can do it without telling a single person, run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's quite the type of thing that should be a personal, private, interpersonal matter, rather than in the public domain, in the national or federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "As an RA, I've already had to deal with this, when you put something on the internet, it becomes a public forum, it's completely public. You can't just post something that's going to color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there in the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get the bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin; someone went to the school and they had to act on it. They can't just let it sit there, then God forbid something happens and they could have prevented it. [Right] On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just mess around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. I apologize, I couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were certain things there that he may have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you post things into the public internet forum, there really is no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be befriending their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to their attention, then it's a completely different thing. Um, yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a fake Facebook or Myspace account and befriend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't befriend my residents because honestly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see it and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Um, not really.",
            "I think the war has been going on for too long. I think the purpose was good at first. To restore democracy in another country. But I think we've lost sight of that purpose and we're now maybe just doing it to prove we're some kind of superpower in the world. I think the original motivation, considering George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein, was questionable. So I think if the original purpose was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal matters involved, I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. I think we got our message across in the first couple of months after starting the war, I think that was a statement in itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year or several years, I just think it's gone on too long. \n\nYes, I think, I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. But I don't think our justification has been deteriorated and misleading over time. It seems like we're still at war just to be at war. And we don't want to come out of this thing without a clear end, without a victory or whatever. \n\nYes, I think it's been long enough and it should stop. I mean, there's a point in time when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We've been draining our own economy for too long, spending billions of dollars on wars on our own turf, such as poverty and whatnot, which we should be spending on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's been going on for too long. \n\nYes, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be a long-term goal in our budget. There are things like poverty or internal improvements, public roads or anything related to schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, which I think that money could be used better. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nI think that's it.",
            "I'd like to clarify a point that\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like that\n\nOkay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy, on platforms like Myspace if you post information on the internet it's almost like it's available to everyone. And I understand on Myspace, you know, in order to see someone's profile, you have to have someone else be a member, you have to add them as a friend or something like that, so if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it, you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you post information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think it was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's different profiles to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's just look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on the situation they came across that profile, or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just happened to see that, or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something, so I don't really know.\n\nYes, um, well, I mean, I personally don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook, I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just wanted to prove how easy it is to get information, and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away, and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I post, but at the same time, I think the whole point of having one is so you can communicate with some of your friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue, because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never really know who can see what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how the high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace, and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people what they could and couldn't do. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm, yeah, we only have this and then one more time to talk about the Iraq War. Yeah, I mean, I feel guilty talking about it, I mean, I hate to say, you know, that I was against it from the beginning, joining the bandwagon of people who are like, oh, I was against it from the start. I was, but it's not really important anymore, because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls, they've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and, I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops who are there, like the US troops who are there right now, think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in, it was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster, there's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states, I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration, or previous administrations, to understand, they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone is arguing that he isn't, but, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, just like quicksand when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them, I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that, but, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now, and like these, these are the people that we're trying to save, the people we're trying to help, telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that, and at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens, if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision to leave, and then you know at least we'll, I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we are now, where we stand.",
            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. And it's not just for women. I think it has to do with the specific field of work that one is in. I mean, in general, I feel that women have it harder because there's the \"glass ceiling\" where, even though it's supposed to be about equality, most people have a hard time finding someone to work under a woman if they're a man because the society has been raised for so long. And often, women in the workplace see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position because, historically, it's been shown that women are not usually in the upper levels of the business world. And I think the same thing goes for men. And in other fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really rare for a man to be at home. And often, people look down on that because society thinks, \"Oh, you're a man, you should be working. You should be the breadwinner of your family. Why are you staying at home?\" And it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has a better job, and it's working out fine for them. But society looks down on that. And in the fashion industry, often people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense. But I think it's because men who are typically into fashion... I think they have different lifestyles. And if a man has the typical lifestyle and is in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women? Like, you don't really know what our case is like? Like these other guys.\" And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of difficult because society has a fixed mindset and, obviously, we've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow. So, I think that if we continue to work at the pace we are now because women are advancing to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, but it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And similarly, as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, maybe the woman has a better job or she wants to be the one who works.\" And then for people in fashion, it'll be like, \"Oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and so they know where I'm coming from.\" So, I guess you have to kind of promote it by showing the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but showing the qualities of them. Because if you force it, people will resist. And I think we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So, I don't really know if there's anything we can do now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time. Yes. And I think they're also discriminated against each other, depending on the type of job you have or where you come from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't so good, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men will look down on you and be like, \"How do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, sometimes it's where you come from that discriminates against you, and from gender to gender. And I don't know, I think that would be another example. Not really.",
            "I mean they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it. But that made it from an offense to a traffic fine. You know what I mean, you get cited and you don’t have to get arrested and brought to jail and all that. But I think if someone gets caught and gets cited, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that. But there are arguments that it is expensive to arrest people and bring them in and to book them and then to let them go, and it costs a lot to bring them to court, maybe twice, maybe three times, and to appoint a public defender, and to pay the judge and the state attorney’s office has to take up the case and basically press the charges. I mean all these things cost a lot. And I mean if you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean many of them are philosophically not willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money. Like many communities are rightfully against marijuana and they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, to a certain extent, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for homeless people. But I think it’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want to have everywhere, all over the streets and stuff, but there’s a whole financial element to it as well, other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be that way. Well no, I mean I don’t know how I would feel about it, well if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, and I mean maybe a lot of people would say they’re smoking and driving, and it’s still a taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I find it awkward for a lot of people. But I think in general, alcohol has a much greater impact on your motor skills. But I think in general, marijuana has a more significant impact on people’s lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making skills. I mean but they both have their drawbacks. And I mean I think when it comes to substances in general, there are no two people who react the same way, I mean, and then there are people who have normal personalities and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then there are people who know how to exercise moderation, and then there are people who don’t, so it makes it really hard to make general statements about substances when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own drawbacks. But no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes, because a lot of things they do are very traditional, like they've done the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics, and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian, my dad was an Episcopalian, but my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them like that. So, I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine says you should do things, but the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. \n\nI don't think that would necessarily influence it; I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. It's just a different realm; it might be an issue, but I probably don't think that would be the case. Well, I guess people who molest children would probably do that regardless of whether they were married or not, because it's a child, which is different from a spouse. So, if you're going to do something like that, you'd probably do it whether you're married or not. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening; I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",
            "I'm not quite sure about this matter, I haven't made a decision,\nSo I can't say which side is right or wrong,\nBut I think that's the trickiest topic we're dealing with today,\nBecause the separation of church and state \nThe topic of marriage is something very difficult to define without offending anyone.\nSo I don't know, I think,\nI think that all civil unions \nShouldn't marriage be looked at \nAnd \nDefined by the government in the sense \nSince it is considered a sacrament \nOne wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr \nBe looked at in a certain way by the government if one was baptized,\nAnd \nSo \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause \nThat's what it is \nTwo people \nThey shouldn't have a separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't go into the question of what kind of marriage it was \nTwo people who got united in a partnership,\nSo \nAnd \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat would just be \nTwo people who entered into a civil union \n\nSo \nIf all the states come to a logical conclusion, then they should try to make it federal law.\nBut \nA constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is just absurd.\nIt is \nSomething that shouldn't be changed in the constitution,\nI mean, it's a very big issue for certain people,\nBut \nIt's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment.\n\nIt's not important enough to change the constitution,\nTo define \nTo ban same-sex marriage \nSimply put.\n\nNo",

However, I believe it should be something that each state decides for itself, instead of the President deciding for the whole country. \n\nLike many states are democratic, and some states are Republican. Obviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think you should disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. Because you kind of chose to live there, you know. So I think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. So I think it should be up to the decision of each state. \n\nWell, I kind of already answered that.\n\nI just don’t think that President Bush should decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just think that I don’t think that President Bush doesn’t live in every single state. So he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to govern itself. I don’t know what to do. So I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. And also, he will be out of office in about two years. And if a Democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should just be up to the decision of each individual state. Because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the President. No, I don’t.",
            "I think that \nNo, I don't know if \nI think, that's how I figure it \nMySpace is a public thing \nAnd \nA message \nYou know, if you look at that definition \nI think, then \nYou know, that's basically meaning to post something for the public to see or others to see \nOr whatever you're trying to get at \nAnd \nNow if you post that on the internet \nI think, you have to realize that others will see it \nWhether it be school officials or not \nI think, that school officials seeing that \nThey had every right to see it \nBecause \nEven if they weren't posting it under the school's name \nThey could have still accessed that \nThrough their homes \nI think it's good to do something that saves lives \nBecause \nAs long as the lives of students are in danger \nI think that's the responsibility of the school system \nI think that's okay \nI think if they go on the internet to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing things they're not supposed to be doing \nThey go there specifically to catch students \nAnd \nTo get them in trouble \nAnd \nI think that's an invasion of privacy \nBut \nI think, if they save lives \nOr make the school a better and safer place \nI don't think that's an invasion at all \nI think it's okay if they do that \n\nYeah, I think I should elaborate more on that \n\nYeah, I think it's easier to \nExpress yourself \nWhen you're writing \nBut \n\nYeah, that's okay \nI think it's a public thing \nAnd if a student posts something on MySpace \nAnd \nIsn't expecting to get in trouble \nThat's ridiculous \nI think that's everything \nI'm worried about posting stuff, even through emails \nI think I wouldn't say anything negative about someone \nBecause \nI'm afraid someone will find it \nAnd \nYou know, everything \nEverything comes back \nAnd \nYou know, it bites you, I guess you could say \n\nI think if you do something as a college student, then you'll grow up to be an important person \nAnd they'll find an email you sent \nAnd \nIf it's on the internet, it's still on the internet \nAnd \nI think if you do that, there's no way to avoid it \nYou'll get in trouble \nAnd \nI don't think that's an invasion of privacy \nBecause \nI said before that \nAnd \nThat's basically what I've been saying \nIt's a public thing \nAnd \nI think that's okay \nI don't know what else to say \n\nI said before, I don't think they should go on the internet to catch students \nBut \nIf they have something that leads them to make the school a safer place \nI think that's okay \nOr \nOther officials like the police to go on \nI think when parents drop off their kids at school, they feel safe \nI've actually discussed that with a \nMy teacher \nI went to a public high school \nAnd \nThey say, \nWe have to ensure that \nLike we would do a lockdown \nAnd \nThings \nAnd \nThat's in reference to the terrorist attacks \nWe had lockdown drills \nAnd \nWe got used to it \nAnd \nI think that has nothing to do with the \nI mean it has something to do with the school shooting \nBecause \nI think that's in case someone breaks into the building \nI think we \nWe practiced that \nTo make the school a safer place \nAnd \nThat's what the school officials did \nThey made it a safer place \nThey prevented something bad from happening \nLike Columbine or something like that \nI think that's all I can say \n\nThat's it, I think",
            "Okay, initially I was for it because I was personally affected by 9/11. \nAlso, I was for going back and basically creating as much chaos as they did here. \nHowever, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences because it was such an emotional event. \nAnd we just went there without being prepared and without a plan. \nAnd I think that backfired on us. \nI don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. \nI don't think it achieved anything. \nI think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. \nI don't think our presence there is going to make a difference if they can't even get along with themselves. \nIt's unfortunate, but due to 9/11, I'm almost indifferent to what happens over there. \nI just don't care about those people. \nI just think they're not human sometimes. \nI don't know, they fight with each other and can't do anything themselves. \nSo, I really don't care. \nI don't know, we definitely went there unprepared. \nWe didn't know what to expect over there. \nIt's also bad because war is viewed very differently over there than it is here. \nThey're just savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're interested in improving their country. \nI just think they want us out of there. \nAnd I think that would be okay for us. \nI think we should just leave and that's it. \nI think we were just hyped up when we went there. \nI don't think we thought rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. \nI think we pretty much just went there seeking revenge and I think President Bush went there because the people wanted to go there because of 9/11. \nAlso, I think he took it upon himself to declare war on Iraq. \nBut at the time, I understand where he was coming from. \nWe really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, \"Let's rebuild and that's it.\" \nSo, I don't think we could have just left it. \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do in terms of creating order. \nI don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do. \nAnd I don't know, I just think they didn't have unity. \nThey didn't know what they were going in there for. \nSo, I think that would have helped us a lot more. \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. \nSo, that's what we created there. \nHonestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. \nHonestly, I think they're always going to be like that. \nAnd I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. \nIt's gone on for long enough. \nI don't think we're making enough progress. \nWe've made progress, but not enough to stay there. \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. \nAnd we can't stay there forever. \nSo, I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying there. \nNo, okay."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views are quite outdated in some aspects, and I think the Church is losing followers because it's not very accepting of many things. Within the cases of gay marriages, abortion, and birth control, the Church has strong views, which is fine, but they seem old-fashioned to me. I think if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because of their views on these situations and because people disagree with them on certain subjects. Therefore, I think the Church has the wrong view on things. I mean, the Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a community where it's taught to be completely wrong and you're against it. The same goes for gay marriage, where if you believe in it and want to do it or feel strongly about it, you might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with it. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or have female priests, but I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. Maybe they wouldn't have done it if they were allowed to be married or have women priests, but I don't know if that would have necessarily changed things. I mean, that was something they did, and it didn't seem to be affected. If they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to tell. I don't see why priests can't be married. The Church says that priests are married to God, but everyone else in the world has a job and a family life. I don't see why priests can't have both. No.",
            "I personally think it's okay for gay couples to get married. I believe it's not just a matter of choice, but also a part of biology. I don't think it's a conscious decision. Gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about the topic, but I'd definitely say it's wrong to say that. It seems it's not really a choice; they don't really have a choice in who they are. Like, I was born straight, and I guess another person is born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held responsible for. I'd definitely think it's wrong to say they made a wrong decision. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not something affecting our country's security or moral issues. It just seems like they're out of place. They don't seem to have the right to intervene in people's lives. That's just who they are - gay people, that's how they were born, at least that's what I think. And they shouldn't be punished for that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security concern or a moral issue; it's just not their place. It's hard. I think the federal government shouldn't be involved because it has nothing to do with our country's security or moral issues. They're just out of place, and it doesn't seem like they have the right to intervene in people's lives.

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's simply no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin; heads will never be tails. But it's like the same thing, and there are a lot of civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing, where your primary or next of kin can't even be in the room with you if you're sick. It's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone and lots of scientific studies have been done, and homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. I don't understand where people, like Catholics, get hung up on saying it's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing. But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yes, they are the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation, or not. But again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption, because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean they're going to have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But I think President Bush has very strong views of his own to do with his religion. Well, his take on gay marriage actually goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research, which I think most of the reasons I've heard at least in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the culture and morality of all the rest is hypocritical of the government, considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay-marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "At the beginning I was okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks and I think we went into Iraq as a pretext - there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and claimed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general the Iraq war still boils my blood. \n\nUm, It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been very openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since 9/11, at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. Um, That last part I forget the name of the Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. Um, But it seems to me that the younger Bush had a kind of bloodlust against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. Well, I do think it's gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. Um, I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order, but I don't necessarily know that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the parliament is very effective at all, that um, Oh I don't remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government, and I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.

            "I don't feel comfortable with this\nIt's not right, that it's legalized or declared legal by a state\nI think it's really up to the churches, because in the constitution it says there's a step between church and state\nIt's clear\nIt's clear\nUh\nIt's\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it \nTrying to exert any kind of power over it \nWould be in defiance of what has already been said and written\nSo \nUh\nAs for the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really a stance of one church against another\nBecause we can see that most Catholics \nUh\nCatholics and Christians are really against it\nAnd don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um\nI don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd although they planned on making an amendment\nI think even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contrary to what's already been said and written\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don't feel that's right\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion\nSo I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don't know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society \nThan it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Okay\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other\nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nUm \nI \nI myself am against war and \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is in many ways \nA \nA repeat of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with\n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing was that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into the war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and the Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard cause once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to its finish but them again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil factor\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let’s see, I’m for gay marriage, I've always been. I think it's a personal preference and what has been proven more and more now is that it could be biological, rather than sociological, so people shouldn't be given less rights just because it's not their control. I think it's inhumane to give them less rights. And I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think there should be any influence from the state and government in this, it's a personal matter, a household matter. You know, in my neighborhood at home there are, I think, two or three openly gay couples who aren't, you know, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way as any other family would. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that with Bush trying to play God and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, it's kind of ridiculous.\n\nYes, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from various different publications and TV reports or newspapers, that it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain; it's something they might be predisposed to be homosexual. Instead of growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know you don't have a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side, opposed to the sociological.\n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that marriage is something that, if a man and a woman want to do it, they can just go to Vegas and do it without telling a single person, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to be on the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's something that should be a personal, private matter, rather than public domain and national, federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum. It's completely public. You can't. I mean, as an R.A., it's something I've actually had to deal with already. When you put something out there, it's going to color people's opinions of you. And if you're talking about blowing things up or if you're talking about shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there, put it to the world. The internet is seen by everybody. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin. Obviously it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school and they have to act on that. They can't just let it sit because then, God forbid, something happens, they could have prevented it. [Right] But you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. Sorry, couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think. What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through a friend of his Facebook and got very worried because there were certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friend-ing their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking. And going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs and if it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Um. Yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Um. Not really.",

I hate joining the bandwagon of people who are like, \"I was against it from the beginning.\" I was against it, but it's not that important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit that they were wrong. And you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now, think it was a stupid idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration, or previous administrations, to understand. They think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's disputing that. But you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand from when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And these are the people that we're trying to save, that we're trying to help. They're telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then we know it's not on us if something happens. If it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in, but you guys made the decision not to, and then we'll at least... I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys. Kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But you know, it'll be better than where we are, where we stand right now.",
            "I feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. Um, and it's not just with women, but also with men. I think it has to do with the specific field of work you're dealing with. Um, I mean, overall, I think women have it harder because there's the glass ceiling where, even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time recognizing that they can work under a woman if they're a man. It's due to how society has been raised for so long. And often in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. And um, I think the same thing goes for men, and like in other industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really uncommon for a man to be the one staying at home. Um, a lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh, you're a man, you should be working, you should be the breadwinner of your family, why are you staying at home? And it can be really hard on them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe their wife has a better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that. And in the fashion industry, um, a lot of times people won't take straight men seriously. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I think it's because typically men who are into fashion, um, like they have different lifestyles, and so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women, if you're not really, like, in that case? And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Um, to change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and obviously, we've made great strides since the 1800s, in many areas, but the change is very slow, and I think that if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more, and just like men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh, maybe the woman has a better job or she wants to be the one working, and um, then for people in fashion, they'll be like, oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives and so they know where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them, because if you force it, people will resist, and I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, it's like people will resist, and we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time. Yes, um, well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you may not have the best grammar in the world, and or even though you may be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, well, how do I really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right, so yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example, um, not really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it. They decriminalized it, which means they no longer considered it a crime. It got knocked down from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket; you know, something you get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean, usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about, are the future ramifications, and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time, there’s an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. When you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of on the open-minded track, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on food programs for homeless people. I mean, so I think it’s important because marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and about everywhere. I mean, there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized, not just financial. Other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized. Well no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well, if it were totally legal, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be smoking and driving. And it’s still like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana. So, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. I mean, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think marijuana has a more negative impact on a lot of people’s lives, as opposed to just their decision making and motor skills. I mean, but they both have their negative effects, and I mean, when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. So, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own negative effects. Um, yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes. Because many of the things they do are very traditional like they've been doing the same things for a long time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe you have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was Episcopalian, no my dad was Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm it might but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. People who molest children would probably do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",
            "I don't know \nI haven't really made a decision on this matter \nSo \nI can't say if either side is right or wrong \nBut \nI believe that this is the most difficult point we're facing today \nBecause \nSomething that's so close to the separation of church and state \nAnd \nHow to define marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending someone \nSo \nI don't know, I think \nI think that all civil unions \nI don't know if marriage should be seen that way \nAnd \nLike \nDefined by the government \nSince it's considered a sacrament \nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr \nBe looked at in a specific way by the government if they were baptized \nAnd \nSo \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause \nThat's what it is \nIt's two people \nThere shouldn't be a separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was \nTwo people got together \nSo \nAnd \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat's just \nOh two people who entered a civil union \n\nUm \nWell if all the states come to a logical conclusion, they should try to make it federal law \nBut \nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is simply ridiculous \nIt is \nSomething that the constitution shouldn't be changed for \nI mean it's a very big issue for some people \nBut \nIt's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment \n\nIt's just not important enough to change the constitution \nTo ban \nTo ban gay marriage \nSimply put \n\nUh \nNo",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like \nHomosexuality is kind of a gray area for me \nBecause \nI have a lot of gay friends \nUm \nI think that I don't necessarily agree with this lifestyle \nBut \nI think it should be legalized \nI don't think it should be a national issue \nHowever I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than \nUm \nLike \nThe president deciding for the entire country \n\nUm \nWell, like many states are democratic \nAnd \nMany states are Republican \nObviously democratic states are going to push for gay marriage \nAnd \nUm \nIf you're living in a democratic state \nLike obviously you know how that state feels about that position \nAnd \nUm \nI don't think you're necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage \nBecause \nLike \nYou kind of chose to live there \nYou know \nSo I \nLike \nI think \nI don't \nI think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals so \nI feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state \n\nWell I kind of already answered that \nBut \n\nUm \nYeah I don't feel as though \nUm \nBush should be allowed to \nUm \nDecide \nUm \nUm \nThat the whole country should be against gay marriage \nI think that it should be up to the \nUm \nIndividual states as to whether they want to legalize it \nI don't agree with his ban on it \n\nUm \nI just \nI just don't think \nLike \nI don't think that \nLike Bush doesn't live in every single state \nSo \nHe shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to govern \nUm \nItself I guess I don't know \nUm \nSo \nI think that \nUm \nSome things should be left up to \nUm \nEach individual state \nPlus he's going to be out of office in like two years \nAnd \nIf a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage \nLike \nIt's just going to go back and forth \nIt should just be up to each individual state \nBecause \nThey're the ones that are going to have to live with that decision \nNot the president \n\nNo I don't",
            "No, I don't think so at all, I mean. Let's see how I see it. In my opinion, Myspace is a public thing, and a bulletin. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know that's just enough reason to post for the public to see or for others to see. Whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you know you have to realize that people will see that, whether it be school officials or not. So, in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it. Because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But, uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Let me see here. Like, you know, if they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble. And I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. But I feel as though, you know, as long as they save lives, or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that?\n\nYeah, I mean, okay. Well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. But\n\nOkay, well, I mean, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. I mean, everything, like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid someone will pick that up and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, I guess you could say.\n\nLike, you know, if you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll like find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble. And I don't think it's not an invasion of privacy because, you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying, it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here.\n\nI mean, like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them or other officials, such as the police, to go on. You know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they said, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff and, uh, that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, because, uh, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess. So we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school safer, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Yeah, that's basically all I can come up with.\n\nUh, no, that's about it.",
            "Okay, I initially thought it was the right thing to do because I was personally affected by September 11. Um, I was for going over there and causing as much chaos as they had caused over here. Um, I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. And we kind of just went over there unprepared, without a plan. Um, I think it backfired on us. Um, I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it, I don't think it achieved anything. Um, I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like I don't think our being over there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. So um, like unfortunately because of September 11, I've almost lost interest in what's going on over there. Um, with those people, I just don't care, I just think, I don't think they're human sometimes. I don't know, they just can't stop fighting with each other and can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care, um, I don't know, we definitely went over there unprepared, we didn't know what we were going to face over there. Um, and it's also bad because war for them is totally different than war for us, they're just like savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're interested in improving their country, I just think they're interested in getting us out of there. And I think that would be fine for us, I think we should just leave and that's it. Um, we just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything, I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay, let's rebuild and that's it. So um, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do, I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order, and I don't know, I just think they didn't, there was no unity, they didn't know what they were going into, so I think that would have helped us a lot more, but like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say, it's gone on for long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress, like we've made progress but not enough to stay there, and I think no matter how long we stay there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse, and we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay."

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views are quite outdated in some aspects, and I think the Church is losing followers because it's not very accepting of many things. Within the cases of gay marriages, abortion, and birth control, the Church has strong views, which is fine, but they seem old-fashioned to me. I think if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because of their views on these situations and because people disagree with them on certain subjects. Therefore, I think the Church has the wrong view on things. I mean, the Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a community where it's taught to be completely wrong and you're against it. The same goes for gay marriage, where if you believe in it and want to do it or feel strongly about it, you might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with it. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or have female priests, but I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. Maybe they wouldn't have done it if they were allowed to be married or have women priests, but I don't know if that would have necessarily changed things. I mean, that was something they did, and it didn't seem to be affected. If they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to tell. I don't see why priests can't be married. The Church says that priests are married to God, but everyone else in the world has a job and a family life. I don't see why priests can't have both. No.",
            "I personally think it's okay for gay couples to get married. I believe it's not just a matter of choice, but also a part of biology. I don't think it's a conscious decision. Gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about the topic, but I'd definitely say it's wrong to say that. It seems it's not really a choice; they don't really have a choice in who they are. Like, I was born straight, and I guess another person is born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held responsible for. I'd definitely think it's wrong to say they made a wrong decision. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not something affecting our country's security or moral issues. It just seems like they're out of place. They don't seem to have the right to intervene in people's lives. That's just who they are - gay people, that's how they were born, at least that's what I think. And they shouldn't be punished for that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security concern or a moral issue; it's just not their place. It's hard. I think the federal government shouldn't be involved because it has nothing to do with our country's security or moral issues. They're just out of place, and it doesn't seem like they have the right to intervene in people's lives.

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's simply no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin; heads will never be tails. But it's like the same thing, and there are a lot of civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing, where your primary or next of kin can't even be in the room with you if you're sick. It's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone and lots of scientific studies have been done, and homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. I don't understand where people, like Catholics, get hung up on saying it's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing. But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yes, they are the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation, or not. But again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption, because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean they're going to have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But I think President Bush has very strong views of his own to do with his religion. Well, his take on gay marriage actually goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research, which I think most of the reasons I've heard at least in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the culture and morality of all the rest is hypocritical of the government, considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay-marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "At the beginning I was okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks and I think we went into Iraq as a pretext - there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and claimed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general the Iraq war still boils my blood. \n\nUm, It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been very openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since 9/11, at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. Um, That last part I forget the name of the Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. Um, But it seems to me that the younger Bush had a kind of bloodlust against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. Well, I do think it's gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. Um, I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order, but I don't necessarily know that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the parliament is very effective at all, that um, Oh I don't remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government, and I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.

            "I don't feel comfortable with this\nIt's not right, that it's legalized or declared legal by a state\nI think it's really up to the churches, because in the constitution it says there's a step between church and state\nIt's clear\nIt's clear\nUh\nIt's\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it \nTrying to exert any kind of power over it \nWould be in defiance of what has already been said and written\nSo \nUh\nAs for the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really a stance of one church against another\nBecause we can see that most Catholics \nUh\nCatholics and Christians are really against it\nAnd don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um\nI don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd although they planned on making an amendment\nI think even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contrary to what's already been said and written\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don't feel that's right\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion\nSo I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don't know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society \nThan it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Okay\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other\nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nUm \nI \nI myself am against war and \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is in many ways \nA \nA repeat of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with\n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing was that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into the war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and the Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard cause once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to its finish but them again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil factor\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let’s see, I’m for gay marriage, I've always been. I think it's a personal preference and what has been proven more and more now is that it could be biological, rather than sociological, so people shouldn't be given less rights just because it's not their control. I think it's inhumane to give them less rights. And I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think there should be any influence from the state and government in this, it's a personal matter, a household matter. You know, in my neighborhood at home there are, I think, two or three openly gay couples who aren't, you know, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way as any other family would. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that with Bush trying to play God and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, it's kind of ridiculous.\n\nYes, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from various different publications and TV reports or newspapers, that it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain; it's something they might be predisposed to be homosexual. Instead of growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know you don't have a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side, opposed to the sociological.\n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that marriage is something that, if a man and a woman want to do it, they can just go to Vegas and do it without telling a single person, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to be on the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's something that should be a personal, private matter, rather than public domain and national, federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum. It's completely public. You can't. I mean, as an R.A., it's something I've actually had to deal with already. When you put something out there, it's going to color people's opinions of you. And if you're talking about blowing things up or if you're talking about shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there, put it to the world. The internet is seen by everybody. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin. Obviously it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school and they have to act on that. They can't just let it sit because then, God forbid, something happens, they could have prevented it. [Right] But you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. Sorry, couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think. What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through a friend of his Facebook and got very worried because there were certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friend-ing their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking. And going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs and if it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Um. Yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Um. Not really.",

I hate joining the bandwagon of people who are like, \"I was against it from the beginning.\" I was against it, but it's not that important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit that they were wrong. And you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now, think it was a stupid idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration, or previous administrations, to understand. They think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's disputing that. But you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand from when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And these are the people that we're trying to save, that we're trying to help. They're telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then we know it's not on us if something happens. If it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in, but you guys made the decision not to, and then we'll at least... I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys. Kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But you know, it'll be better than where we are, where we stand right now.",
            "I feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. Um, and it's not just with women, but also with men. I think it has to do with the specific field of work you're dealing with. Um, I mean, overall, I think women have it harder because there's the glass ceiling where, even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time recognizing that they can work under a woman if they're a man. It's due to how society has been raised for so long. And often in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. And um, I think the same thing goes for men, and like in other industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really uncommon for a man to be the one staying at home. Um, a lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh, you're a man, you should be working, you should be the breadwinner of your family, why are you staying at home? And it can be really hard on them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe their wife has a better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that. And in the fashion industry, um, a lot of times people won't take straight men seriously. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I think it's because typically men who are into fashion, um, like they have different lifestyles, and so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women, if you're not really, like, in that case? And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Um, to change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and obviously, we've made great strides since the 1800s, in many areas, but the change is very slow, and I think that if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more, and just like men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh, maybe the woman has a better job or she wants to be the one working, and um, then for people in fashion, they'll be like, oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives and so they know where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them, because if you force it, people will resist, and I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, it's like people will resist, and we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time. Yes, um, well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you may not have the best grammar in the world, and or even though you may be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, well, how do I really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right, so yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example, um, not really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it. They decriminalized it, which means they no longer considered it a crime. It got knocked down from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket; you know, something you get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean, usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about, are the future ramifications, and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time, there’s an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. When you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of on the open-minded track, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on food programs for homeless people. I mean, so I think it’s important because marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and about everywhere. I mean, there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized, not just financial. Other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized. Well no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well, if it were totally legal, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be smoking and driving. And it’s still like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana. So, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. I mean, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think marijuana has a more negative impact on a lot of people’s lives, as opposed to just their decision making and motor skills. I mean, but they both have their negative effects, and I mean, when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. So, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own negative effects. Um, yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes. Because many of the things they do are very traditional like they've been doing the same things for a long time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe you have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was Episcopalian, no my dad was Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm it might but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. People who molest children would probably do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",
            "I don't know \nI haven't really made a decision on this matter \nSo \nI can't say if either side is right or wrong \nBut \nI believe that this is the most difficult point we're facing today \nBecause \nSomething that's so close to the separation of church and state \nAnd \nHow to define marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending someone \nSo \nI don't know, I think \nI think that all civil unions \nI don't know if marriage should be seen that way \nAnd \nLike \nDefined by the government \nSince it's considered a sacrament \nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr \nBe looked at in a specific way by the government if they were baptized \nAnd \nSo \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause \nThat's what it is \nIt's two people \nThere shouldn't be a separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was \nTwo people got together \nSo \nAnd \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat's just \nOh two people who entered a civil union \n\nUm \nWell if all the states come to a logical conclusion, they should try to make it federal law \nBut \nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is simply ridiculous \nIt is \nSomething that the constitution shouldn't be changed for \nI mean it's a very big issue for some people \nBut \nIt's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment \n\nIt's just not important enough to change the constitution \nTo ban \nTo ban gay marriage \nSimply put \n\nUh \nNo",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like \nHomosexuality is kind of a gray area for me \nBecause \nI have a lot of gay friends \nUm \nI think that I don't necessarily agree with this lifestyle \nBut \nI think it should be legalized \nI don't think it should be a national issue \nHowever I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than \nUm \nLike \nThe president deciding for the entire country \n\nUm \nWell, like many states are democratic \nAnd \nMany states are Republican \nObviously democratic states are going to push for gay marriage \nAnd \nUm \nIf you're living in a democratic state \nLike obviously you know how that state feels about that position \nAnd \nUm \nI don't think you're necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage \nBecause \nLike \nYou kind of chose to live there \nYou know \nSo I \nLike \nI think \nI don't \nI think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals so \nI feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state \n\nWell I kind of already answered that \nBut \n\nUm \nYeah I don't feel as though \nUm \nBush should be allowed to \nUm \nDecide \nUm \nUm \nThat the whole country should be against gay marriage \nI think that it should be up to the \nUm \nIndividual states as to whether they want to legalize it \nI don't agree with his ban on it \n\nUm \nI just \nI just don't think \nLike \nI don't think that \nLike Bush doesn't live in every single state \nSo \nHe shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to govern \nUm \nItself I guess I don't know \nUm \nSo \nI think that \nUm \nSome things should be left up to \nUm \nEach individual state \nPlus he's going to be out of office in like two years \nAnd \nIf a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage \nLike \nIt's just going to go back and forth \nIt should just be up to each individual state \nBecause \nThey're the ones that are going to have to live with that decision \nNot the president \n\nNo I don't",
            "No, I don't think so at all, I mean. Let's see how I see it. In my opinion, Myspace is a public thing, and a bulletin. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know that's just enough reason to post for the public to see or for others to see. Whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you know you have to realize that people will see that, whether it be school officials or not. So, in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it. Because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But, uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Let me see here. Like, you know, if they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble. And I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. But I feel as though, you know, as long as they save lives, or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that?\n\nYeah, I mean, okay. Well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. But\n\nOkay, well, I mean, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. I mean, everything, like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid someone will pick that up and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, I guess you could say.\n\nLike, you know, if you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll like find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble. And I don't think it's not an invasion of privacy because, you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying, it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here.\n\nI mean, like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them or other officials, such as the police, to go on. You know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they said, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff and, uh, that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, because, uh, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess. So we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school safer, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Yeah, that's basically all I can come up with.\n\nUh, no, that's about it.",
            "Okay, I initially thought it was the right thing to do because I was personally affected by September 11. Um, I was for going over there and causing as much chaos as they had caused over here. Um, I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. And we kind of just went over there unprepared, without a plan. Um, I think it backfired on us. Um, I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it, I don't think it achieved anything. Um, I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like I don't think our being over there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. So um, like unfortunately because of September 11, I've almost lost interest in what's going on over there. Um, with those people, I just don't care, I just think, I don't think they're human sometimes. I don't know, they just can't stop fighting with each other and can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care, um, I don't know, we definitely went over there unprepared, we didn't know what we were going to face over there. Um, and it's also bad because war for them is totally different than war for us, they're just like savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're interested in improving their country, I just think they're interested in getting us out of there. And I think that would be fine for us, I think we should just leave and that's it. Um, we just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything, I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay, let's rebuild and that's it. So um, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do, I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order, and I don't know, I just think they didn't, there was no unity, they didn't know what they were going into, so I think that would have helped us a lot more, but like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say, it's gone on for long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress, like we've made progress but not enough to stay there, and I think no matter how long we stay there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse, and we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views are quite outdated in some aspects, and I think the Church is losing followers because it's not very accepting of many things. Within the cases of gay marriages, abortion, and birth control, the Church has strong views, which is fine, but they seem old-fashioned to me. I think if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because of their views on these situations and because people disagree with them on certain subjects. Therefore, I think the Church has the wrong view on things. I mean, the Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a community where it's taught to be completely wrong and you're against it. The same goes for gay marriage, where if you believe in it and want to do it or feel strongly about it, you might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with it. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or have female priests, but I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. Maybe they wouldn't have done it if they were allowed to be married or have women priests, but I don't know if that would have necessarily changed things. I mean, that was something they did, and it didn't seem to be affected. If they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to tell. I don't see why priests can't be married. The Church says that priests are married to God, but everyone else in the world has a job and a family life. I don't see why priests can't have both. No.",
            "I personally think it's okay for gay couples to get married. I believe it's not just a matter of choice, but also a part of biology. I don't think it's a conscious decision. Gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about the topic, but I'd definitely say it's wrong to say that. It seems it's not really a choice; they don't really have a choice in who they are. Like, I was born straight, and I guess another person is born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held responsible for. I'd definitely think it's wrong to say they made a wrong decision. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not something affecting our country's security or moral issues. It just seems like they're out of place. They don't seem to have the right to intervene in people's lives. That's just who they are - gay people, that's how they were born, at least that's what I think. And they shouldn't be punished for that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security concern or a moral issue; it's just not their place. It's hard. I think the federal government shouldn't be involved because it has nothing to do with our country's security or moral issues. They're just out of place, and it doesn't seem like they have the right to intervene in people's lives.

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's simply no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin; heads will never be tails. But it's like the same thing, and there are a lot of civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing, where your primary or next of kin can't even be in the room with you if you're sick. It's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone and lots of scientific studies have been done, and homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. I don't understand where people, like Catholics, get hung up on saying it's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing. But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yes, they are the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation, or not. But again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption, because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean they're going to have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But I think President Bush has very strong views of his own to do with his religion. Well, his take on gay marriage actually goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research, which I think most of the reasons I've heard at least in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the culture and morality of all the rest is hypocritical of the government, considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay-marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "At the beginning I was okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks and I think we went into Iraq as a pretext - there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and claimed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general the Iraq war still boils my blood. \n\nUm, It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been very openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since 9/11, at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. Um, That last part I forget the name of the Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. Um, But it seems to me that the younger Bush had a kind of bloodlust against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. Well, I do think it's gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. Um, I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order, but I don't necessarily know that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the parliament is very effective at all, that um, Oh I don't remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government, and I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. Um, (laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I was thinking \nMmhmm \nShould I just talk about it? \nOk \nOk, that would be cool \nUh huh \nUh \nSorry, I'm done \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me think \nBut at this point, I feel like it's pointless because it's not even a declared war actually \nI mean, it was just a revenge thing against Iraq because we thought they carried out the 9/11 attacks \nSo I feel like \nI mean, I'm not a big fan of the War in Iraq \nI don't keep up with it \nI don't know the details \nBut at this point, I know that we're staying over there to try and build a democratic system so that it can feel like another U.S. place \nAnd also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut there's no reason for us to stay over there because it's making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd if we stay over there then what's going to end up happening is we have to try and build a democratic system which is going to take forever because a democratic system can't be built in just a day \nAnd then if we leave they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me think \nOh, this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I know the least about \nUm \nIraq War \nOh, this is hard \nUh \nMmm \nI don't know \nDo you have anything I can go by? \nOk \nThanks \nUm \nWell, actually I think \nI think the war should continue because it's not fair \nI don't think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I think \nYou know \nI think the only reason we use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn't even declare it \nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it was never declared by Congress \nI think that's how it works \nYou have to declare a war with Congress \nAnd then it's \nI just don't think it's a big point to still stay over there and try \nActually not \nI do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them \nBut it's also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like \nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of what it's doing and it's like \nAnd what it's doing to \nRemember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nThe Vietnam War was an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war \nAnd he's like saying \nHe'll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nYou have to make this in 30 minutes, don't you? \nUh \nOk, yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt's like \nIt's hard to say \nI want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it's going to be even worse for them \nAnd it's going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them \nAnd they've been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it's going to \nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat's it \nOk",
            "I don't feel comfortable with this\nIt's not right, that it's legalized or declared legal by a state\nI think it's really up to the churches, because in the constitution it says there's a step between church and state\nIt's clear\nIt's clear\nUh\nIt's\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it \nTrying to exert any kind of power over it \nWould be in defiance of what has already been said and written\nSo \nUh\nAs for the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really a stance of one church against another\nBecause we can see that most Catholics \nUh\nCatholics and Christians are really against it\nAnd don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um\nI don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd although they planned on making an amendment\nI think even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contrary to what's already been said and written\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don't feel that's right\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion\nSo I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don't know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society \nThan it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Okay\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other\nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nUm \nI \nI myself am against war and \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is in many ways \nA \nA repeat of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with\n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing was that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into the war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and the Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard cause once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to its finish but them again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil factor\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let’s see, I’m for gay marriage, I've always been. I think it's a personal preference and what has been proven more and more now is that it could be biological, rather than sociological, so people shouldn't be given less rights just because it's not their control. I think it's inhumane to give them less rights. And I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think there should be any influence from the state and government in this, it's a personal matter, a household matter. You know, in my neighborhood at home there are, I think, two or three openly gay couples who aren't, you know, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way as any other family would. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that with Bush trying to play God and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, it's kind of ridiculous.\n\nYes, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from various different publications and TV reports or newspapers, that it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain; it's something they might be predisposed to be homosexual. Instead of growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know you don't have a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side, opposed to the sociological.\n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that marriage is something that, if a man and a woman want to do it, they can just go to Vegas and do it without telling a single person, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to be on the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's something that should be a personal, private matter, rather than public domain and national, federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum. It's completely public. You can't. I mean, as an R.A., it's something I've actually had to deal with already. When you put something out there, it's going to color people's opinions of you. And if you're talking about blowing things up or if you're talking about shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there, put it to the world. The internet is seen by everybody. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin. Obviously it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school and they have to act on that. They can't just let it sit because then, God forbid, something happens, they could have prevented it. [Right] But you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. Sorry, couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think. What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through a friend of his Facebook and got very worried because there were certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friend-ing their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking. And going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs and if it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Um. Yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Um. Not really.",

I hate joining the bandwagon of people who are like, \"I was against it from the beginning.\" I was against it, but it's not that important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit that they were wrong. And you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now, think it was a stupid idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration, or previous administrations, to understand. They think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's disputing that. But you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand from when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And these are the people that we're trying to save, that we're trying to help. They're telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then we know it's not on us if something happens. If it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in, but you guys made the decision not to, and then we'll at least... I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys. Kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But you know, it'll be better than where we are, where we stand right now.",
            "I feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. Um, and it's not just with women, but also with men. I think it has to do with the specific field of work you're dealing with. Um, I mean, overall, I think women have it harder because there's the glass ceiling where, even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time recognizing that they can work under a woman if they're a man. It's due to how society has been raised for so long. And often in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. And um, I think the same thing goes for men, and like in other industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really uncommon for a man to be the one staying at home. Um, a lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh, you're a man, you should be working, you should be the breadwinner of your family, why are you staying at home? And it can be really hard on them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe their wife has a better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that. And in the fashion industry, um, a lot of times people won't take straight men seriously. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I think it's because typically men who are into fashion, um, like they have different lifestyles, and so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women, if you're not really, like, in that case? And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Um, to change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and obviously, we've made great strides since the 1800s, in many areas, but the change is very slow, and I think that if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more, and just like men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh, maybe the woman has a better job or she wants to be the one working, and um, then for people in fashion, they'll be like, oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives and so they know where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them, because if you force it, people will resist, and I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, it's like people will resist, and we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time. Yes, um, well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you may not have the best grammar in the world, and or even though you may be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, well, how do I really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right, so yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example, um, not really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it. They decriminalized it, which means they no longer considered it a crime. It got knocked down from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket; you know, something you get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean, usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about, are the future ramifications, and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time, there’s an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. When you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of on the open-minded track, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on food programs for homeless people. I mean, so I think it’s important because marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and about everywhere. I mean, there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized, not just financial. Other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized. Well no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well, if it were totally legal, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be smoking and driving. And it’s still like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana. So, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. I mean, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think marijuana has a more negative impact on a lot of people’s lives, as opposed to just their decision making and motor skills. I mean, but they both have their negative effects, and I mean, when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. So, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own negative effects. Um, yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes. Because many of the things they do are very traditional like they've been doing the same things for a long time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe you have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was Episcopalian, no my dad was Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm it might but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. People who molest children would probably do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",
            "I don't know \nI haven't really made a decision on this matter \nSo \nI can't say if either side is right or wrong \nBut \nI believe that this is the most difficult point we're facing today \nBecause \nSomething that's so close to the separation of church and state \nAnd \nHow to define marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending someone \nSo \nI don't know, I think \nI think that all civil unions \nI don't know if marriage should be seen that way \nAnd \nLike \nDefined by the government \nSince it's considered a sacrament \nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr \nBe looked at in a specific way by the government if they were baptized \nAnd \nSo \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause \nThat's what it is \nIt's two people \nThere shouldn't be a separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was \nTwo people got together \nSo \nAnd \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat's just \nOh two people who entered a civil union \n\nUm \nWell if all the states come to a logical conclusion, they should try to make it federal law \nBut \nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is simply ridiculous \nIt is \nSomething that the constitution shouldn't be changed for \nI mean it's a very big issue for some people \nBut \nIt's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment \n\nIt's just not important enough to change the constitution \nTo ban \nTo ban gay marriage \nSimply put \n\nUh \nNo",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like \nHomosexuality is kind of a gray area for me \nBecause \nI have a lot of gay friends \nUm \nI think that I don't necessarily agree with this lifestyle \nBut \nI think it should be legalized \nI don't think it should be a national issue \nHowever I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than \nUm \nLike \nThe president deciding for the entire country \n\nUm \nWell, like many states are democratic \nAnd \nMany states are Republican \nObviously democratic states are going to push for gay marriage \nAnd \nUm \nIf you're living in a democratic state \nLike obviously you know how that state feels about that position \nAnd \nUm \nI don't think you're necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage \nBecause \nLike \nYou kind of chose to live there \nYou know \nSo I \nLike \nI think \nI don't \nI think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals so \nI feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state \n\nWell I kind of already answered that \nBut \n\nUm \nYeah I don't feel as though \nUm \nBush should be allowed to \nUm \nDecide \nUm \nUm \nThat the whole country should be against gay marriage \nI think that it should be up to the \nUm \nIndividual states as to whether they want to legalize it \nI don't agree with his ban on it \n\nUm \nI just \nI just don't think \nLike \nI don't think that \nLike Bush doesn't live in every single state \nSo \nHe shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to govern \nUm \nItself I guess I don't know \nUm \nSo \nI think that \nUm \nSome things should be left up to \nUm \nEach individual state \nPlus he's going to be out of office in like two years \nAnd \nIf a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage \nLike \nIt's just going to go back and forth \nIt should just be up to each individual state \nBecause \nThey're the ones that are going to have to live with that decision \nNot the president \n\nNo I don't",
            "No, I don't think so at all, I mean. Let's see how I see it. In my opinion, Myspace is a public thing, and a bulletin. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know that's just enough reason to post for the public to see or for others to see. Whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you know you have to realize that people will see that, whether it be school officials or not. So, in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it. Because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But, uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Let me see here. Like, you know, if they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble. And I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. But I feel as though, you know, as long as they save lives, or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that?\n\nYeah, I mean, okay. Well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. But\n\nOkay, well, I mean, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. I mean, everything, like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid someone will pick that up and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, I guess you could say.\n\nLike, you know, if you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll like find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble. And I don't think it's not an invasion of privacy because, you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying, it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here.\n\nI mean, like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them or other officials, such as the police, to go on. You know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they said, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff and, uh, that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, because, uh, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess. So we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school safer, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Yeah, that's basically all I can come up with.\n\nUh, no, that's about it.",
            "Okay, I initially thought it was the right thing to do because I was personally affected by September 11. Um, I was for going over there and causing as much chaos as they had caused over here. Um, I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. And we kind of just went over there unprepared, without a plan. Um, I think it backfired on us. Um, I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it, I don't think it achieved anything. Um, I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like I don't think our being over there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. So um, like unfortunately because of September 11, I've almost lost interest in what's going on over there. Um, with those people, I just don't care, I just think, I don't think they're human sometimes. I don't know, they just can't stop fighting with each other and can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care, um, I don't know, we definitely went over there unprepared, we didn't know what we were going to face over there. Um, and it's also bad because war for them is totally different than war for us, they're just like savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're interested in improving their country, I just think they're interested in getting us out of there. And I think that would be fine for us, I think we should just leave and that's it. Um, we just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything, I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay, let's rebuild and that's it. So um, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do, I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order, and I don't know, I just think they didn't, there was no unity, they didn't know what they were going into, so I think that would have helped us a lot more, but like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say, it's gone on for long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress, like we've made progress but not enough to stay there, and I think no matter how long we stay there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse, and we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that gay marriages should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s no good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nThere are a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \nBecause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s a really hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s no involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their

Yeah, um, I mean, there are a lot of medications that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, um, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances.

You should accept its beneficial properties, I think.

            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. I don't think it's as strict as it used to be. I know even as I've grown up, I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would get these cute little dresses. And matching shoes. And a matching purse. That was just all I did in the church. I went to a private school. And I would see all my friends there on Sundays. And we would just go there. But now that I've grown older, they've introduced a \"teenager mass.\" And they've cut it down to thirty minutes. And people wear a lot more casual clothing. Especially in the summer, people come in their beach clothes, straight from the beach. You'd have the families there who are just running in late. So I think it's become much more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just much more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing I've noticed. Like, that's the church I know; I don't know the church politics and whatnot. But yes, that's it. [OK, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have... an attraction to young children. So I think even if you get them married, it's just the person; it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think also when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. There are religions where they're allowed to get married. Like Seventh Heaven, I don't know what kind of... He's a reverend or a minister or something. [Mm hmm] They're allowed to get married. So I know it's a little different. But if they really want to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. [OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, on which part... About... [Um] The changes... [That it really wouldn't make a difference I guess.] Oh, on pedophilia... [Mm hmm] I think... Like the whole... Um... Sexuality is primarily based on genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I think people aren't just born that way. I think they're born that way. I think it has nothing to do with how they were raised. Maybe it plays a role in this case. But I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that by getting married. You can try, but it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them. But I don't think they knew in all cases. [OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] I don't have any.",
            "At first I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the 9/11 attacks and that we went into Iraq as a pretext, and there were pretexts that led us into Iraq.\nI think the Bush administration quickly connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and claimed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false.\nAnd that really got under my skin and in general, the Iraq war really gets my blood boiling.\n\nI just think that the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and hasn't yet taken responsibility for that fact.\nEven Colin Powell \nI mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nAnd \nI think that's malfeasance in office, and I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since 9/11 at the very least, I mean.\nI think they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nThe other part \nI forget the name of \nUm \nThe Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that claim in his book, after he was probably pushed out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to me that the younger Bush had a kind of bloodlust against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell \nI do think it's gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though, because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq's sovereignty will become an issue \nA major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can't remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less than a year ago \nHis party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with a lot of radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\n(laughs)",
            "I'm not sure how to put this, but I kind of feel like the war in Iraq is pointless because it's not even officially a declared war\nIt was more of a revenge thing because we thought Iraq was responsible for the 9/11 attacks\nIt's hard to say, but I don't really care about the War in Iraq\nI'm not really up to date on it, and I don't know the details\nBut at this point, I know we're staying there to help build democracy so it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd also to get oil and stuff from them, but that's not a good reason to stay there because it's causing so much conflict\nAnd if we stay there, we'll be trying to build democracy which will take forever because democracy can't be built overnight\nAnd if we leave, they'll be angry with us because we messed everything up and now they have to start over from scratch\nI'm not really sure what to say\nThis is one topic I don't know much about\nI don't know what to think about the War in Iraq\nIt's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq, and I want them to keep going because I know they want them to stay\nBut the people over there have lives and we've kind of destroyed them because we made them leave\nI'm sure some kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so unsafe and there are all these different little groups in Iraq that are killing each other because of their different beliefs\nBut then again, it's hard to say\nI want them to stay, but it's like they have such a different culture than we do, and if we stay there we're going to try to change them into a second United States\nAnd that's going to make it worse for them\nAnd it's going to make the whole Al-Qaeda problem worse and their hatred towards the U.S. will get worse because we're trying to change them\nAnd they've had this whole totalitarian, dictatorial system for so long\nYou know, I think it's going to end up hurting us in the end to keep trying to interfere\nSo I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years",
            "I don't feel like it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as legal. I think it's really up to the churches, as it's even stated in the constitution, separation of church and state. It's clear that trying to do anything with it, trying to enforce any kind of power over it, would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution. So, regarding the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another. Because as we can see, most Catholics, Catholics are really against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think it's really up to the state to decide what the churches are allowed to and what they're not allowed to make. Separation of church and state is pretty much a key aspect of the constitution and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they did plan on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just in contradiction to what's already been said and written there. And plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't feel that it's right at all. In that aspect, no I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it, I think, by I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Almost, I think I pretty much said it all",
            "The war in Iraq \nNow \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUh \nAnd I think that it’s a repeat in many ways of the war in Vietnam and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \nAnd that’s horrible and what they were doing is that they were taking out the countries government and I really don’t think the government the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government and it’s a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists and uphold or implement democracy \nAnd it’s a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear cut victory like it wasn’t a clear cut victory in Vietnam because there are a large number of insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army \nYou’re fighting the citizens of the country and \nSo I think the government should have been more prepared and planned for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been and they really didn’t plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq \nI mean we shouldn’t have been so naive to believe that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful \nI mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was a lot of tension and there was civil war and \nIt’s just not an easy thing to do and I think the government the US government made it seem like an easy thing to do \nAnd so the war in Iraq is a difficult decision to make because once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life so how can we abandon them now \nSo it’s probably something that we should try to see to its finish but again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq \nI mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we’re invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is the oil issue \nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them \nSo I don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions \nLet’s see \nUh \nI just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace in Iraq soon but probably not",
            "Let's see, I'm for gay marriage. I've always been. Um, I really think it's a personal preference, and uh, and it's something that's been proven more and more now that it's biological, not sociological, so people shouldn't have fewer rights because something that really isn't in their control. Um, due to reasons that aren't in their control, I think it's a bit inhumane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. \n\nUh, I don't think there's any, I think that politics and government in general shouldn't play a role in this, it's not even at the state level, it's a personal level, it's a household level. Um, you know, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples who aren't, you know, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. Um, but they function the same way as any other family would. You know, they walk the dogs down the street, just like anyone else would, and I think that with Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage in the way he wants to, I think it's a bit ridiculous. \n\nYes, sure. I mean, I think, I mean, I'm convinced, I've read and heard from various different publications and and TV reports or newspapers, what it is now, it's something chemical in your brain, it's something that might predispose you to be homosexual. Opposed to growing up and you know, maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know, you don't have a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side opposed to the sociological side. \n\nUm, well, other than the obvious, you know, in this, I think maybe because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can do it without telling a single person and just run off to, you know, Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to be on the front page of the New York Times, you know. Uh, I think it's a bit the kind of thing that should be a personal, private affair, as opposed to, um, in public domain and um, national, um federal domain. \n\nUh, no, no.",

I think it's a drain on our economy for a cause that's long since been dragged out. \n\nYes, I mean they're spending billions and billions of dollars \nAnd \nWar shouldn't be in our budget for the long term. \nThere are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements \nYou know \nUm \nPublic roads or anything dealing with schools \nWe certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that \nHealth care that I think that money could be much better spent on. \nRight now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's all",

            "Hmm, we only have this and then one more time to talk about the Iraq War. Um, yeah, I mean, I feel guilty talking about it. I mean, I hate to say you know, I hate to join the bandwagon of people who are like, oh, I was against it from the beginning. Um, I was, but it's not really important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit that they were wrong. And um, I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls. Um, they've done US polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, um, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. Um, I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. Um, I mean, I think it's just a cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap, and for this administration or previous administrations, and they think that they can just introduce democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that, um, this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's arguing that he wasn't. But, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went there. Um, I don't even know what to say about it. Um, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. Um, I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there. Um, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. Um, I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people we're trying to save, like we're trying to help, telling us to leave. Um, you know, I think they might know better than that. And um, if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens, you know if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay but you guys made the decision not to. Um, and then you know, at least we'll, I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than, where we stand right now. Where we stand.",
            "Yes, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. Um. And it's not just with women, but I think it's because of the specific field that one deals with in their work. Um. I mean overall I feel like women have it harder because there's the \"glass ceiling\" where even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time working under a woman if they're a man. It's just how society has been since so long. And often in the workplace, women see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. Um. I think the same thing applies to men, though. And like in other industries such as fashion or being a stay-at-home dad, it's really uncommon. Um. To have a stay-at-home dad who's a man, and um, many people look down upon that because society thinks: \"Oh, you're the man, you should be working,\" \"You should be the breadwinner of your family.\" Why are you staying home? And it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and to help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that. And in the fashion industry, um, many people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I think it's because typically men who are into fashion, um, have different lifestyles. And so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like: \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women?\" Like you don't really know what our thing is like, like the other guys. And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Um. To change it is a bit more difficult because society has a fixed mindset, and obviously we've come a long way since the 1800s, and leaps and bounds, but the change is slow, so I think that if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it. And just like men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize: \"Oh, maybe the woman has the better job or she wants to be the one who works,\" and um, then for like people in the fashion industry, they'll be like: \"Oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives and stuff,\" and so they do know where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not by being too pushy, but by saying like the qualities of them, because if you force it people will resist, and I think that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time, yes. Um. And I think they're also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar might not be so good, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men will look down upon you and be like: \"How do I know you're really saying what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example.",
            "My understanding is they didn't legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a crime to \nUh \nA \nTo more like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get fined for rather than have to get arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets fined for it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it's totally fine \nAnd I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it's \nIt's important because I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there's this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn't necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don't know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don't really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don't",
            "I would say yes because some of the things they do are very traditional like they've been doing the same things for long periods of time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. I guess some Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week and they're very strict on how things are done and sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee. They don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian no I'm sorry my dad was an Episcopalian my mom was a Catholic and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions we always learned to love others that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that so I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm it might but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. Well I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I'm not even sure if I've made up my mind on this issue yet \nSo I can't say if either side is right or wrong \nBut I do think this is the trickiest topic we're facing today \nBecause it's so close to the separation of church and state \nAnd how to define marriage is something that's very tricky to do without offending anyone \nSo I don't know, I think that all civil unions \nI don't know whether marriage should be looked at \nAnd like \nDefined by the government \nSeeing as it's a sacrament, like \nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr be looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized \nAnd so \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause that's what it is \nIt's two people \nThey shouldn't have the separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't look into like, well, what kind of marriage was it \nTwo people got unioned together \nSo and \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat would just be \nOh two people you got a civil union \n\nWell if all the states can come to a logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law \nBut a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous \nIt is \nSomething that the constitution shouldn't just be amended for \nI mean it's a very big issue for certain people \nBut it's not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment \n\nIt's just not important enough to amend the constitution \nTo ban gay marriage \nSimply put \n\nUh no",
            "I was basically raised in a Christian family, so homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. \n\nBecause I have many gay friends.\n\nI think that I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. \n\nBut I think it should be legalized.\n\nI don't think it should be a national issue.\n\nHowever, I feel like it should be something that each state decides for themselves rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, a lot of states are democratic. \n\nAnd a lot of states are republican.\n\nObviously, democratic states are going to fight for same-sex marriage.\n\nAnd if you're living in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position.\n\nAnd I don't think that you're necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nBecause you did choose to live there.\n\nI think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals.\n\nI feel like it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already mentioned that.\n\nYeah, I don't think that Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against same-sex marriage.\n\nI think it should be up to each individual state to decide whether they want to legalize it.\n\nI don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just think that I don't think that \n\nI don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state.\n\nSo he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to govern itself.\n\nI think that some things should be left up to each individual state.\n\nPlus, he's going to be out of office in about two years.\n\nAnd if a democratic president decides that they want to lift the ban on same-sex marriage, it's just going to go back and forth.\n\nIt should just be up to each individual state.\n\nBecause they're the ones who are going to have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that gay marriages should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s no good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nThere are a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \nBecause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s a really hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s no involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their

Yeah, um, I mean, there are a lot of medications that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, um, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances.

You should accept its beneficial properties, I think.

            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. I don't think it's as strict as it used to be. I know even as I've grown up, I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would get these cute little dresses. And matching shoes. And a matching purse. That was just all I did in the church. I went to a private school. And I would see all my friends there on Sundays. And we would just go there. But now that I've grown older, they've introduced a \"teenager mass.\" And they've cut it down to thirty minutes. And people wear a lot more casual clothing. Especially in the summer, people come in their beach clothes, straight from the beach. You'd have the families there who are just running in late. So I think it's become much more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just much more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing I've noticed. Like, that's the church I know; I don't know the church politics and whatnot. But yes, that's it. [OK, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have... an attraction to young children. So I think even if you get them married, it's just the person; it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think also when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. There are religions where they're allowed to get married. Like Seventh Heaven, I don't know what kind of... He's a reverend or a minister or something. [Mm hmm] They're allowed to get married. So I know it's a little different. But if they really want to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. [OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, on which part... About... [Um] The changes... [That it really wouldn't make a difference I guess.] Oh, on pedophilia... [Mm hmm] I think... Like the whole... Um... Sexuality is primarily based on genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I think people aren't just born that way. I think they're born that way. I think it has nothing to do with how they were raised. Maybe it plays a role in this case. But I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that by getting married. You can try, but it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them. But I don't think they knew in all cases. [OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] I don't have any.",
            "At first I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the 9/11 attacks and that we went into Iraq as a pretext, and there were pretexts that led us into Iraq.\nI think the Bush administration quickly connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and claimed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false.\nAnd that really got under my skin and in general, the Iraq war really gets my blood boiling.\n\nI just think that the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and hasn't yet taken responsibility for that fact.\nEven Colin Powell \nI mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nAnd \nI think that's malfeasance in office, and I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since 9/11 at the very least, I mean.\nI think they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nThe other part \nI forget the name of \nUm \nThe Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that claim in his book, after he was probably pushed out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to me that the younger Bush had a kind of bloodlust against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell \nI do think it's gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though, because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq's sovereignty will become an issue \nA major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can't remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less than a year ago \nHis party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with a lot of radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\n(laughs)",
            "I'm not sure how to put this, but I kind of feel like the war in Iraq is pointless because it's not even officially a declared war\nIt was more of a revenge thing because we thought Iraq was responsible for the 9/11 attacks\nIt's hard to say, but I don't really care about the War in Iraq\nI'm not really up to date on it, and I don't know the details\nBut at this point, I know we're staying there to help build democracy so it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd also to get oil and stuff from them, but that's not a good reason to stay there because it's causing so much conflict\nAnd if we stay there, we'll be trying to build democracy which will take forever because democracy can't be built overnight\nAnd if we leave, they'll be angry with us because we messed everything up and now they have to start over from scratch\nI'm not really sure what to say\nThis is one topic I don't know much about\nI don't know what to think about the War in Iraq\nIt's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq, and I want them to keep going because I know they want them to stay\nBut the people over there have lives and we've kind of destroyed them because we made them leave\nI'm sure some kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so unsafe and there are all these different little groups in Iraq that are killing each other because of their different beliefs\nBut then again, it's hard to say\nI want them to stay, but it's like they have such a different culture than we do, and if we stay there we're going to try to change them into a second United States\nAnd that's going to make it worse for them\nAnd it's going to make the whole Al-Qaeda problem worse and their hatred towards the U.S. will get worse because we're trying to change them\nAnd they've had this whole totalitarian, dictatorial system for so long\nYou know, I think it's going to end up hurting us in the end to keep trying to interfere\nSo I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years",
            "I don't feel like it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as legal. I think it's really up to the churches, as it's even stated in the constitution, separation of church and state. It's clear that trying to do anything with it, trying to enforce any kind of power over it, would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution. So, regarding the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another. Because as we can see, most Catholics, Catholics are really against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think it's really up to the state to decide what the churches are allowed to and what they're not allowed to make. Separation of church and state is pretty much a key aspect of the constitution and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they did plan on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just in contradiction to what's already been said and written there. And plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't feel that it's right at all. In that aspect, no I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it, I think, by I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Almost, I think I pretty much said it all",
            "The war in Iraq \nNow \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUh \nAnd I think that it’s a repeat in many ways of the war in Vietnam and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \nAnd that’s horrible and what they were doing is that they were taking out the countries government and I really don’t think the government the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government and it’s a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists and uphold or implement democracy \nAnd it’s a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear cut victory like it wasn’t a clear cut victory in Vietnam because there are a large number of insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army \nYou’re fighting the citizens of the country and \nSo I think the government should have been more prepared and planned for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been and they really didn’t plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq \nI mean we shouldn’t have been so naive to believe that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful \nI mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was a lot of tension and there was civil war and \nIt’s just not an easy thing to do and I think the government the US government made it seem like an easy thing to do \nAnd so the war in Iraq is a difficult decision to make because once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life so how can we abandon them now \nSo it’s probably something that we should try to see to its finish but again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq \nI mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we’re invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is the oil issue \nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them \nSo I don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions \nLet’s see \nUh \nI just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace in Iraq soon but probably not",
            "Let's see, I'm for gay marriage. I've always been. Um, I really think it's a personal preference, and uh, and it's something that's been proven more and more now that it's biological, not sociological, so people shouldn't have fewer rights because something that really isn't in their control. Um, due to reasons that aren't in their control, I think it's a bit inhumane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. \n\nUh, I don't think there's any, I think that politics and government in general shouldn't play a role in this, it's not even at the state level, it's a personal level, it's a household level. Um, you know, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples who aren't, you know, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. Um, but they function the same way as any other family would. You know, they walk the dogs down the street, just like anyone else would, and I think that with Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage in the way he wants to, I think it's a bit ridiculous. \n\nYes, sure. I mean, I think, I mean, I'm convinced, I've read and heard from various different publications and and TV reports or newspapers, what it is now, it's something chemical in your brain, it's something that might predispose you to be homosexual. Opposed to growing up and you know, maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know, you don't have a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side opposed to the sociological side. \n\nUm, well, other than the obvious, you know, in this, I think maybe because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can do it without telling a single person and just run off to, you know, Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to be on the front page of the New York Times, you know. Uh, I think it's a bit the kind of thing that should be a personal, private affair, as opposed to, um, in public domain and um, national, um federal domain. \n\nUh, no, no.",

I think it's a drain on our economy for a cause that's long since been dragged out. \n\nYes, I mean they're spending billions and billions of dollars \nAnd \nWar shouldn't be in our budget for the long term. \nThere are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements \nYou know \nUm \nPublic roads or anything dealing with schools \nWe certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that \nHealth care that I think that money could be much better spent on. \nRight now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's all",

            "Hmm, we only have this and then one more time to talk about the Iraq War. Um, yeah, I mean, I feel guilty talking about it. I mean, I hate to say you know, I hate to join the bandwagon of people who are like, oh, I was against it from the beginning. Um, I was, but it's not really important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit that they were wrong. And um, I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls. Um, they've done US polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, um, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. Um, I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. Um, I mean, I think it's just a cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap, and for this administration or previous administrations, and they think that they can just introduce democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that, um, this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's arguing that he wasn't. But, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went there. Um, I don't even know what to say about it. Um, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. Um, I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there. Um, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. Um, I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people we're trying to save, like we're trying to help, telling us to leave. Um, you know, I think they might know better than that. And um, if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens, you know if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay but you guys made the decision not to. Um, and then you know, at least we'll, I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than, where we stand right now. Where we stand.",
            "Yes, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. Um. And it's not just with women, but I think it's because of the specific field that one deals with in their work. Um. I mean overall I feel like women have it harder because there's the \"glass ceiling\" where even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time working under a woman if they're a man. It's just how society has been since so long. And often in the workplace, women see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. Um. I think the same thing applies to men, though. And like in other industries such as fashion or being a stay-at-home dad, it's really uncommon. Um. To have a stay-at-home dad who's a man, and um, many people look down upon that because society thinks: \"Oh, you're the man, you should be working,\" \"You should be the breadwinner of your family.\" Why are you staying home? And it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and to help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that. And in the fashion industry, um, many people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I think it's because typically men who are into fashion, um, have different lifestyles. And so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like: \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women?\" Like you don't really know what our thing is like, like the other guys. And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Um. To change it is a bit more difficult because society has a fixed mindset, and obviously we've come a long way since the 1800s, and leaps and bounds, but the change is slow, so I think that if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it. And just like men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize: \"Oh, maybe the woman has the better job or she wants to be the one who works,\" and um, then for like people in the fashion industry, they'll be like: \"Oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives and stuff,\" and so they do know where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not by being too pushy, but by saying like the qualities of them, because if you force it people will resist, and I think that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time, yes. Um. And I think they're also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar might not be so good, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men will look down upon you and be like: \"How do I know you're really saying what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example.",
            "My understanding is they didn't legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a crime to \nUh \nA \nTo more like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get fined for rather than have to get arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets fined for it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it's totally fine \nAnd I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it's \nIt's important because I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there's this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn't necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don't know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don't really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don't",
            "I would say yes because some of the things they do are very traditional like they've been doing the same things for long periods of time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. I guess some Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week and they're very strict on how things are done and sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee. They don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian no I'm sorry my dad was an Episcopalian my mom was a Catholic and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions we always learned to love others that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that so I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm it might but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. Well I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I'm not even sure if I've made up my mind on this issue yet \nSo I can't say if either side is right or wrong \nBut I do think this is the trickiest topic we're facing today \nBecause it's so close to the separation of church and state \nAnd how to define marriage is something that's very tricky to do without offending anyone \nSo I don't know, I think that all civil unions \nI don't know whether marriage should be looked at \nAnd like \nDefined by the government \nSeeing as it's a sacrament, like \nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr be looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized \nAnd so \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause that's what it is \nIt's two people \nThey shouldn't have the separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't look into like, well, what kind of marriage was it \nTwo people got unioned together \nSo and \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat would just be \nOh two people you got a civil union \n\nWell if all the states can come to a logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law \nBut a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous \nIt is \nSomething that the constitution shouldn't just be amended for \nI mean it's a very big issue for certain people \nBut it's not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment \n\nIt's just not important enough to amend the constitution \nTo ban gay marriage \nSimply put \n\nUh no",
            "I was basically raised in a Christian family, so homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. \n\nBecause I have many gay friends.\n\nI think that I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. \n\nBut I think it should be legalized.\n\nI don't think it should be a national issue.\n\nHowever, I feel like it should be something that each state decides for themselves rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, a lot of states are democratic. \n\nAnd a lot of states are republican.\n\nObviously, democratic states are going to fight for same-sex marriage.\n\nAnd if you're living in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position.\n\nAnd I don't think that you're necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nBecause you did choose to live there.\n\nI think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals.\n\nI feel like it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already mentioned that.\n\nYeah, I don't think that Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against same-sex marriage.\n\nI think it should be up to each individual state to decide whether they want to legalize it.\n\nI don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just think that I don't think that \n\nI don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state.\n\nSo he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to govern itself.\n\nI think that some things should be left up to each individual state.\n\nPlus, he's going to be out of office in about two years.\n\nAnd if a democratic president decides that they want to lift the ban on same-sex marriage, it's just going to go back and forth.\n\nIt should just be up to each individual state.\n\nBecause they're the ones who are going to have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.",

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that gay marriages should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s no good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nThere are a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \nBecause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s a really hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s no involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their

Yeah, um, I mean, there are a lot of medications that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, um, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances.

You should accept its beneficial properties, I think.

            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. I don't think it's as strict as it used to be. I know even as I've grown up, I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would get these cute little dresses. And matching shoes. And a matching purse. That was just all I did in the church. I went to a private school. And I would see all my friends there on Sundays. And we would just go there. But now that I've grown older, they've introduced a \"teenager mass.\" And they've cut it down to thirty minutes. And people wear a lot more casual clothing. Especially in the summer, people come in their beach clothes, straight from the beach. You'd have the families there who are just running in late. So I think it's become much more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just much more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing I've noticed. Like, that's the church I know; I don't know the church politics and whatnot. But yes, that's it. [OK, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have... an attraction to young children. So I think even if you get them married, it's just the person; it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think also when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. There are religions where they're allowed to get married. Like Seventh Heaven, I don't know what kind of... He's a reverend or a minister or something. [Mm hmm] They're allowed to get married. So I know it's a little different. But if they really want to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. [OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, on which part... About... [Um] The changes... [That it really wouldn't make a difference I guess.] Oh, on pedophilia... [Mm hmm] I think... Like the whole... Um... Sexuality is primarily based on genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I think people aren't just born that way. I think they're born that way. I think it has nothing to do with how they were raised. Maybe it plays a role in this case. But I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that by getting married. You can try, but it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them. But I don't think they knew in all cases. [OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] I don't have any.",
            "At first I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the 9/11 attacks and that we went into Iraq as a pretext, and there were pretexts that led us into Iraq.\nI think the Bush administration quickly connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and claimed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false.\nAnd that really got under my skin and in general, the Iraq war really gets my blood boiling.\n\nI just think that the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and hasn't yet taken responsibility for that fact.\nEven Colin Powell \nI mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nAnd \nI think that's malfeasance in office, and I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since 9/11 at the very least, I mean.\nI think they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nThe other part \nI forget the name of \nUm \nThe Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that claim in his book, after he was probably pushed out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to me that the younger Bush had a kind of bloodlust against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell \nI do think it's gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though, because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq's sovereignty will become an issue \nA major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can't remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less than a year ago \nHis party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with a lot of radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\n(laughs)",
            "I'm not sure how to put this, but I kind of feel like the war in Iraq is pointless because it's not even officially a declared war\nIt was more of a revenge thing because we thought Iraq was responsible for the 9/11 attacks\nIt's hard to say, but I don't really care about the War in Iraq\nI'm not really up to date on it, and I don't know the details\nBut at this point, I know we're staying there to help build democracy so it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd also to get oil and stuff from them, but that's not a good reason to stay there because it's causing so much conflict\nAnd if we stay there, we'll be trying to build democracy which will take forever because democracy can't be built overnight\nAnd if we leave, they'll be angry with us because we messed everything up and now they have to start over from scratch\nI'm not really sure what to say\nThis is one topic I don't know much about\nI don't know what to think about the War in Iraq\nIt's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq, and I want them to keep going because I know they want them to stay\nBut the people over there have lives and we've kind of destroyed them because we made them leave\nI'm sure some kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so unsafe and there are all these different little groups in Iraq that are killing each other because of their different beliefs\nBut then again, it's hard to say\nI want them to stay, but it's like they have such a different culture than we do, and if we stay there we're going to try to change them into a second United States\nAnd that's going to make it worse for them\nAnd it's going to make the whole Al-Qaeda problem worse and their hatred towards the U.S. will get worse because we're trying to change them\nAnd they've had this whole totalitarian, dictatorial system for so long\nYou know, I think it's going to end up hurting us in the end to keep trying to interfere\nSo I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years",
            "I don't feel like it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as legal. I think it's really up to the churches, as it's even stated in the constitution, separation of church and state. It's clear that trying to do anything with it, trying to enforce any kind of power over it, would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution. So, regarding the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another. Because as we can see, most Catholics, Catholics are really against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think it's really up to the state to decide what the churches are allowed to and what they're not allowed to make. Separation of church and state is pretty much a key aspect of the constitution and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they did plan on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just in contradiction to what's already been said and written there. And plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't feel that it's right at all. In that aspect, no I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it, I think, by I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Almost, I think I pretty much said it all",
            "The war in Iraq \nNow \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUh \nAnd I think that it’s a repeat in many ways of the war in Vietnam and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \nAnd that’s horrible and what they were doing is that they were taking out the countries government and I really don’t think the government the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government and it’s a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists and uphold or implement democracy \nAnd it’s a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear cut victory like it wasn’t a clear cut victory in Vietnam because there are a large number of insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army \nYou’re fighting the citizens of the country and \nSo I think the government should have been more prepared and planned for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been and they really didn’t plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq \nI mean we shouldn’t have been so naive to believe that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful \nI mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was a lot of tension and there was civil war and \nIt’s just not an easy thing to do and I think the government the US government made it seem like an easy thing to do \nAnd so the war in Iraq is a difficult decision to make because once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life so how can we abandon them now \nSo it’s probably something that we should try to see to its finish but again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq \nI mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we’re invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is the oil issue \nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them \nSo I don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions \nLet’s see \nUh \nI just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace in Iraq soon but probably not",
            "Let's see, I'm for gay marriage. I've always been. Um, I really think it's a personal preference, and uh, and it's something that's been proven more and more now that it's biological, not sociological, so people shouldn't have fewer rights because something that really isn't in their control. Um, due to reasons that aren't in their control, I think it's a bit inhumane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. \n\nUh, I don't think there's any, I think that politics and government in general shouldn't play a role in this, it's not even at the state level, it's a personal level, it's a household level. Um, you know, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples who aren't, you know, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. Um, but they function the same way as any other family would. You know, they walk the dogs down the street, just like anyone else would, and I think that with Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage in the way he wants to, I think it's a bit ridiculous. \n\nYes, sure. I mean, I think, I mean, I'm convinced, I've read and heard from various different publications and and TV reports or newspapers, what it is now, it's something chemical in your brain, it's something that might predispose you to be homosexual. Opposed to growing up and you know, maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know, you don't have a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side opposed to the sociological side. \n\nUm, well, other than the obvious, you know, in this, I think maybe because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can do it without telling a single person and just run off to, you know, Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to be on the front page of the New York Times, you know. Uh, I think it's a bit the kind of thing that should be a personal, private affair, as opposed to, um, in public domain and um, national, um federal domain. \n\nUh, no, no.",

I think it's a drain on our economy for a cause that's long since been dragged out. \n\nYes, I mean they're spending billions and billions of dollars \nAnd \nWar shouldn't be in our budget for the long term. \nThere are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements \nYou know \nUm \nPublic roads or anything dealing with schools \nWe certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that \nHealth care that I think that money could be much better spent on. \nRight now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's all",

            "Hmm, we only have this and then one more time to talk about the Iraq War. Um, yeah, I mean, I feel guilty talking about it. I mean, I hate to say you know, I hate to join the bandwagon of people who are like, oh, I was against it from the beginning. Um, I was, but it's not really important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit that they were wrong. And um, I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls. Um, they've done US polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, um, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. Um, I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. Um, I mean, I think it's just a cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap, and for this administration or previous administrations, and they think that they can just introduce democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that, um, this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's arguing that he wasn't. But, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went there. Um, I don't even know what to say about it. Um, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. Um, I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there. Um, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. Um, I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people we're trying to save, like we're trying to help, telling us to leave. Um, you know, I think they might know better than that. And um, if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens, you know if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay but you guys made the decision not to. Um, and then you know, at least we'll, I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than, where we stand right now. Where we stand.",
            "Yes, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. Um. And it's not just with women, but I think it's because of the specific field that one deals with in their work. Um. I mean overall I feel like women have it harder because there's the \"glass ceiling\" where even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time working under a woman if they're a man. It's just how society has been since so long. And often in the workplace, women see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. Um. I think the same thing applies to men, though. And like in other industries such as fashion or being a stay-at-home dad, it's really uncommon. Um. To have a stay-at-home dad who's a man, and um, many people look down upon that because society thinks: \"Oh, you're the man, you should be working,\" \"You should be the breadwinner of your family.\" Why are you staying home? And it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and to help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that. And in the fashion industry, um, many people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I think it's because typically men who are into fashion, um, have different lifestyles. And so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like: \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women?\" Like you don't really know what our thing is like, like the other guys. And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Um. To change it is a bit more difficult because society has a fixed mindset, and obviously we've come a long way since the 1800s, and leaps and bounds, but the change is slow, so I think that if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it. And just like men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize: \"Oh, maybe the woman has the better job or she wants to be the one who works,\" and um, then for like people in the fashion industry, they'll be like: \"Oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives and stuff,\" and so they do know where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not by being too pushy, but by saying like the qualities of them, because if you force it people will resist, and I think that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time, yes. Um. And I think they're also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar might not be so good, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men will look down upon you and be like: \"How do I know you're really saying what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example.",
            "My understanding is they didn't legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a crime to \nUh \nA \nTo more like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get fined for rather than have to get arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets fined for it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it's totally fine \nAnd I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it's \nIt's important because I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there's this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn't necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don't know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don't really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don't",
            "I would say yes because some of the things they do are very traditional like they've been doing the same things for long periods of time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. I guess some Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week and they're very strict on how things are done and sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee. They don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian no I'm sorry my dad was an Episcopalian my mom was a Catholic and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions we always learned to love others that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that so I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm it might but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. Well I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I'm not even sure if I've made up my mind on this issue yet \nSo I can't say if either side is right or wrong \nBut I do think this is the trickiest topic we're facing today \nBecause it's so close to the separation of church and state \nAnd how to define marriage is something that's very tricky to do without offending anyone \nSo I don't know, I think that all civil unions \nI don't know whether marriage should be looked at \nAnd like \nDefined by the government \nSeeing as it's a sacrament, like \nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr be looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized \nAnd so \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause that's what it is \nIt's two people \nThey shouldn't have the separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't look into like, well, what kind of marriage was it \nTwo people got unioned together \nSo and \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat would just be \nOh two people you got a civil union \n\nWell if all the states can come to a logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law \nBut a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous \nIt is \nSomething that the constitution shouldn't just be amended for \nI mean it's a very big issue for certain people \nBut it's not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment \n\nIt's just not important enough to amend the constitution \nTo ban gay marriage \nSimply put \n\nUh no",
            "I was basically raised in a Christian family, so homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. \n\nBecause I have many gay friends.\n\nI think that I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. \n\nBut I think it should be legalized.\n\nI don't think it should be a national issue.\n\nHowever, I feel like it should be something that each state decides for themselves rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, a lot of states are democratic. \n\nAnd a lot of states are republican.\n\nObviously, democratic states are going to fight for same-sex marriage.\n\nAnd if you're living in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position.\n\nAnd I don't think that you're necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nBecause you did choose to live there.\n\nI think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals.\n\nI feel like it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already mentioned that.\n\nYeah, I don't think that Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against same-sex marriage.\n\nI think it should be up to each individual state to decide whether they want to legalize it.\n\nI don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just think that I don't think that \n\nI don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state.\n\nSo he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to govern itself.\n\nI think that some things should be left up to each individual state.\n\nPlus, he's going to be out of office in about two years.\n\nAnd if a democratic president decides that they want to lift the ban on same-sex marriage, it's just going to go back and forth.\n\nIt should just be up to each individual state.\n\nBecause they're the ones who are going to have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.",

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views are a bit old-fashioned. They have strong opinions on many things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. I think this is one of the reasons why the Catholic Church is losing followers. They are not very open to many things. \n\nI think if they were to adapt a bit, they wouldn't lose as many followers. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because they don't share their views. They think the Catholic Church has the wrong views. If you're for abortion, for example, you might not feel comfortable in a community that believes abortion is wrong. The same goes for gay marriage and other things. If you believe the Catholic Church is wrong, you might not be able to join a community that upholds these views. I think there's no reason why priests can't get married or why there can't be female priests. But I'm not sure if that would have made a difference. \n\nIf priests got married or there were female priests, it might not have made a difference. It's hard to say if they would have acted differently. I think there's no reason why priests can't get married. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God, but I don't think that's the same as a marriage. Everyone has a job and a family and other people they love. Why shouldn't that be the same for priests?",
            "I personally don't oppose men getting married. I think one doesn't consciously decide whether to be gay or not. I think you shouldn't be held responsible for who you are. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this much thought, but I think it's wrong for them to say that. \n\nIt seems to me that it's not like a choice whether you're gay or not. I mean, you're either gay or straight, and that's something you can't actively choose. It's like being born gay or not, and I think it's wrong to hold someone responsible for their sexual orientation. \n\nI think the federal government shouldn't interfere because it's not a legal or moral issue. I mean, you should just accept who you are and not try to change someone. It's tough to exclude the federal government, but I think they shouldn't interfere because it's not their business. \n\nIt's hard to exclude them, but I think they shouldn't interfere because it's not their thing. It's not about national security or moral concerns, it's just that they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have the right to interfere in people's lives. And you know, that's who they are, the gay people, that's just how they were born, at least that's what I think, and I mean they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn’t a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but they are just different. It’s like two different sides of the same coin, and heads will never be tails, but it’s the same thing. There are many civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and healthcare, where your primary or next of kin can’t visit because they aren’t technically family. It’s silly to spend the rest of your life with someone but not be able to have them in the room with you if you’re sick. Many scientific studies have been done and they show that homosexual couples have the same success rates and the same factors that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It’s just a relationship, it’s the same thing. Where people get hung up is that homosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church, they’re asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no involvement with church and state, then it shouldn’t be an issue. The Catholic church can believe whatever they want, but it shouldn’t be an issue in a legal sense. If you’re allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It’s like segregation, separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the roles played by different partners and so on. People are worried about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. They are especially worried about children of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society, but it’s hard to say. The main drawback to adoption is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. In New York City, they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools, kids get bullied and beat up, and parents protest to get them removed from school. It’s just a kid, they have the same points of view and everything, and parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. They can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But President Bush has very strong views related to his religion. His views on gay marriage go along with his views on abortion and stem cell research, and most of the reasons I’ve heard are moral reasons. Morality is not always negotiable, but it differs from person to person. It’s not fair to embrace the morality of one group in America while ignoring the culture and morality of the rest. It’s not fair to go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the whole country. It’s hypocritical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage considering the recent controversy over “under God” in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are opposed to that but will let laws be made that enforce religious standards on the whole country. Many people are against gay people and gay marriage because they believe they are somehow psychologically damaged. The American Psychological Association has just put out a memo saying that is untrue. If people listened to institutions that actually do research and studies on these subjects instead of their neighbors and friends, and maybe what’s popular opinion in their culture and church, then the world would be seen a little bit differently. No.",

            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. I understand that it's not as strict as it used to be. I know, even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would wear cute little dresses. And I would wear matching shoes. And I would wear a matching purse. That was the case when I went to a private school. And I would see all my friends on the weekends. And we would just go. But now, as I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass. And they cut it down to 30 minutes. And people dress a lot more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes, straight from the beach. You'd have families there who are just running late. So I think it's become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. People are wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just a lot more casual compared to that. What I've noticed is that that's the biggest thing that's changed. That's the church I know. I don't know the politics of the church and whatnot. But yeah, that's it. [OK, what exactly do you have to say about the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia?] I don't think these things could have been prevented. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. I think even if you let them get married, it's just the person. It's not because they're allowed to get married or not. I also think that when they become a priest, it's their decision. There are religions where they're allowed to get married. For example, on Seventh Heaven. I don't know what kind of [a reverend or a minister or something]. [mm hmm] But they're allowed to get married. I know it's a little different. If they really want to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe choose a different faith. [OK, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, about the changes. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, pedophilia. [Mm hmm] I think like the whole thing, sexual attraction before, as if it were genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I don't think people become it. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with upbringing. It might have something to do a little bit in this case, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through a marriage. You could try, but then it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, but I don't think in all cases they knew. [OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] No",
            "I was initially okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still pretty much reeling from the 9/11 attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that the Bush administration was quick to connect the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general the Iraq war really boils my blood. I was initially for the Iraq war, but now I think it was a bad idea to think that we would find WMDs in Iraq. I think that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, I mean, after he came back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that is a perversion of the constitution, I think that is an impeachable offense because they lied to the American people. I think that the Bush administration completely disregards the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since September 11. Honestly, I think they had the intention to go to war from the start. I think they went into Iraq to secure their energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. I think it's gone on long enough, but I also think that if we withdraw now, there's a good chance that the country will plunge into civil war and even more people will die as a result. I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving towards now seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to try to restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea because I think it will also cause more problems in the long term because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major point of contention. I think the interim government is dissolving because it's not effective. I've heard that the parliament is not very effective and that the Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process or what's happening. And also Mugtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I think it was less than a year ago, his party now has at least 20 seats in the Iraqi parliament and I think we're still dealing with radical elements that are vying for control of the government. I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. I can't discuss this in polite company.",
            "I was thinking \nI mean, let's just talk about this? \nOkay, cool \nUh-huh \nUh \nOkay, sorry \nOkay \nHow do I feel about the war in Iraq? \nLet me see \nUh \nAt this point, I feel like it's kind of pointless because it's not even officially declared as a war \nAnd I think it was just a big revenge thing against Iraq because we thought they were the ones who bombed the U.S. \nYou know, like the 9/11 attacks \nSo I don't feel like \nI mean, I'm not a big fan of the war in Iraq \nSo I don't really keep up with it \nI don't know the big details of it \nBut at this point, I know we're just going to stay there and try to build democracy so it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd also so we can get oil and resources from them \nBut that's not a good reason to stay there because it's causing a lot of resentment \nSo \nAnd then, if we stay there, it's going to end up with us trying to build democracy, which is going to take forever because democracy can't be built in a day \nAnd then if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUh \nLet me think \nOh, this is so difficult \nThis is the one topic I don't know anything about \nUh \nWar in Iraq \nOh, this is hard \nUh \nMmm \nI don't know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOkay \nThanks \nUh \nWell, actually \nI think \nI think the war should continue because it's not fair \nI don't think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I think \nYou know \nI think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore \nBecause we didn't even declare it \nI think that's how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by Congress \nAnd then it's \nI just don't think it's a big deal to stay there and try to help them \nBut it's also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like \nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of what it's doing and it's like \nAnd what it's doing to \nRemember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nThe Vietnam War was an undeclared war and it's now considered a meaningless war \nAnd he's like saying \nHe'll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nDoesn't this have to be a half an hour? \nUh \nOkay, yeah \nUh \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to continue because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are just killing each other because of different beliefs \nBut then again \nIt's like \nIt's hard to say \nI want them to be there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there, we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nIt's going to be even worse for them \nAnd it's going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Qaeda thing is just going to get even bigger and their hatred towards the U.S. is just going to get even bigger because we're now trying to change them \nAnd they've been going on this whole totalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it's going to \nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat's it \nOkay",
            "I don't see how it would be right to make it constitutionally legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal because I think it's up to the churches, as it's even stated in the constitution, separation of church and state. It's clear that trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be in direct contradiction to what has already been said and written in the constitution. In terms of the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really just choosing one church's belief over another because most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas. I don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal. The decision of what's legal or illegal should be left up to the churches. Separation of church and state is basically a key aspect of the constitution and what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Although they thought about proposing an amendment, I think even proposing an amendment about it would be completely wrong and in direct contradiction to what's already been said and written there. I also think that it would be one of the few amendments that actually restricts the people rather than the government. So, I don't think that's right. No, I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic, and as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion. So I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular, and there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it, I think, by I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nWell, \nTo start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUh \nAnd I think that it's \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear, clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUh \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with a country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUh \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short, successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was a lot of tension and there was a civil war and \nUh \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUh \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell, that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUh \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is it too much to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue \nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions was before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nUh \nI just hope that it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I think I'm for gay marriage, I've always been. I really think it's a personal preference and it's something that's been proven more and more now that it's biological rather than sociological, so to give people less rights due to something that's really not under their control. I think it's kinda inhumane and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think there's any role for politics and government in this; it's not even at a state level, it's a personal level, a family level. I know two or three openly gay couples in my neighborhood who aren't married or anything because they're not allowed to, but they function the same way as any other family would. They walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to is kinda ridiculous.\n\nYeah, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different publications and TV reports or newspapers that it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain, something you might be predisposed to be gay. As opposed to growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know you don't have anything to do with it, so that would be the biological side rather than sociological.\n\nWell, other than the obvious, I think maybe because marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it they can do it without telling a single person, just run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it'll make the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it should be a personal, private, matter rather than a public and national issue.\n\nNo, no.",

            "I think the war has been going on for too long, I think the purpose in the beginning was good. To restore democracy in another country is a good purpose. But I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose and we're now maybe just doing it because we're doing it to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I also think the original motivations were questionable because of George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \n\nSo, I think if the original motivation was to give democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, if there were personal matters involved I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. I think we got our purpose across in the first couple of months just starting the war, I think that was a statement in and of itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too long.\n\nYeah, I think. I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think our reason over time has been deteriorated and misconceived. It seems like we're still at war just to go to war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive end, a victory or whatever.\n\nYeah, I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway, and I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf, like poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out.\n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our budget for the long term. There are obvious things like poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that, healthcare, that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for.",
            "Can I ask a question clarifying that it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like that\n\nO k, umm, no I don't think that's an invasion of privacy on sites such as Myspace if I mean if you post information on the internet it's pretty much available for everyone to see and I understand on Myspace you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile you might need to be their friend or something like that but if that's the case you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it you're giving them permission to see your profile so I mean anytime you put information on the internet you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that so if I think that was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think O let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything um I mean I don't think it would really be right to go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something so I don't really know\n\nYeah, um well, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook I do it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me and I saw something on TV once that was about this this man who just he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me and it's hard because you think that they know your interests they know what you look like sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day who your friends are they pretty much know a lot about you all sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends I don't want to limit it too much so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know I mean you never really know who can look at what so\n\nHum, uh, well I heard my roommate was telling me that her um high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that's the only other thought I can think of \n\nYes",

I mean, I hate to say you know, I hate joining the bandwagon of people who say I was against it from the beginning. Yeah, I was, but it's not really important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now, think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states, I mean, it's just too big a gap for this administration or previous administrations to understand. And they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that totally different people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's arguing that he wasn't, but, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them, I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that, but, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago, that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these people that we're trying to save, these people that we're trying to help, are telling us to leave. Yeah, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. If it completely goes to hell, we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we'll, I mean if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the US. \n\nNot just for women, I think it has to do with the specific field of work you're in. \n\nI mean, overall, I think women have it harder because of the \"glass ceiling\" where even with equal opportunities, most people have a hard time finding someone who works under a woman if they're a man. \n\nBecause society has been built this way for so long. \n\nAnd often in the workplace, women see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position just because historically, it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. \n\nAnd, I think the same goes for men. \n\nIn certain industries like fashion or raising children at home, it's really uncommon for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. \n\nAnd often, people will look down on them because society thinks, \"Well, you're a man, you should be working and making money, why are you staying at home?\" \n\nAnd it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and the woman has a better job. \n\nAnd it's working out fine for them, but society looks down on it. \n\nIn the fashion industry, it's often the case that people won't take straight men seriously who are interested in fashion. \n\nI don't know if that makes sense, but I think it's because men who are interested in fashion often have a different lifestyle. \n\nSo if you have a typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women, like you don't really know what our case is like, like the other guys.\" \n\nAnd depending on the field of work you're in, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the US. \n\nIt's hard to change because society has a set mindset, and we've made huge progress since the 1800s, but it's a slow process. \n\nIf we continue at the same rate because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, it's a long process. \n\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. \n\nAnd just like men who stay at home to raise their children, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh wait, maybe the woman has the better job or she wants to be the one working.\" \n\nAnd in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Oh wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or wives and stuff, so they do know where I'm coming from.\" \n\nSo maybe you have to promote it by showing the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against without being too pushy. \n\nIf you force it, people will resist. \n\nAnd I think we're in a good balance where it's starting to permeate that way. \n\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist. \n\nAnd we've made progress, and change takes time. \n\nYes, and... \n\nThere is also discrimination between genders, depending on the field of work you're in or where you're from. \n\nIf you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't that great, but you're extremely intelligent and you worked your way up to a CEO position, other men will look down on you because they'll say, \"I don't know if you really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right.\" \n\nSo it's sometimes like where you're from discriminates against you. \n\nAnd between genders. \n\nI don't know, I think that would be another example.",
            "I mean they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nAh \nThat knocked it down from a crime to like a traffic violation \nYou know it’s a crime you get punished for, but you don’t get arrested and taken to jail \nAh \nI think if someone gets caught and gets punished then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nI don’t think the negative consequences go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut there’s an argument that \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest someone and take them to a cell and book them and then let them go and then bring them to court maybe two times maybe three \nAnd then hire a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press charges \nI mean all these things cost a lot of money \nAnd I mean \nWhen you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble I mean a lot of them aren’t philosophically willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open-minded \nI have to use the word liberal \nI understand what I mean \nA kind of way of thinking \nThen I think it’s fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on social programs for seniors and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for homeless people \nAh \nI think it’s \nIt’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you want just lying around everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole financial aspect to it as well \nOther reasons why it shouldn’t be done \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel if it were completely legal \nI mean you could sell it like cigarettes in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be smoking and driving \nAnd it’s still taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nAh \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI think it would be uncomfortable for a lot of people \nAh \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is a bit low \nAh \nI don’t really know \nAh \nI think alcohol has more of a negative effect on your ability to drive \nAh \nI think marijuana has a more negative effect on a person’s lifestyle \nIn comparison to their decision making and control \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their negative effects \nAnd I mean when it comes to substances in general \nIt seems like no two people react the same \nI mean and some people have normal personalities and they just do everything they have \nAnd then there are people who can control themselves and then there are people who can’t \nSo \nI think it’s hard to make general statements about the substance when people react differently \nBut I do think they both have their negative effects \nAh \nYeah \nAh \nNo I don’t",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they've done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt's good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it's also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI think \nMany Catholics believe they have to go to Church every Sunday \nAnd \nUm \nThey're very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don't accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI'm sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad's religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat's not really \nLike \nTo say to love others and then not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI think a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it's so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don't think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don't think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nBecause it's just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don't think that that would be an issue \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it's a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you're going to do something like that \nYou're probably going to do it whether or not you're married \nLike \nI don't think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope",
            "I'm not sure, I haven't made up my mind on this matter yet. So I can't say if one side is right or wrong. But I believe this is the most complicated aspect we're facing today. Because there's something delicate about the separation of church and state. And defining marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending anyone. So I don't know, I think. I think that all civil unions are something that I don't know if marriage should be looked at as. And like defined by the government, since it's considered a sacrament. Well, people wouldn't get tax breaks or looked at any differently by the government if they were baptized. And so if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is. It's two people, they shouldn't have a separation of church and state, they shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was. Two people got united. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, that would just be two people who got a civil union. \n\nWell, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just absurd. It is something like the constitution shouldn't just be amended because it's a big issue for certain people. I mean it's a very big topic for some people. But it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Simply put. Uh no",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a gray area for me. \n\nBecause I have a lot of gay friends. \n\nI think that I don’t necessarily agree with that lifestyle. \n\nBut I think that it should be legalized. \n\nI don’t think it should be a national issue. \n\nHowever I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than something the president decides for the entire country. \n\nWell, like many states are democratic, so many also have republican governments. \n\nObviously democratic states are going to vote for gay marriage. \n\nAnd if you live in a democratic state, you already know how that state feels about that position. \n\nI don’t think you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. \n\nBecause you’ve already chosen to live there. \n\nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals. \n\nSo I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. \n\nWell I kind of already said that. \n\nNow, I don’t think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. \n\nI think it should be up to each individual state as to whether they want to legalize it. \n\nI don’t agree with his stance against gay marriage. \n\nI just think some things should be left up to each individual state. \n\nPlus he’s going to be out of office in about two years. \n\nAnd if a democratic president decides he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it’s just going to go back and forth. \n\nIt should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are going to have to live with that decision, not the president. \n\nNo I don’t.",
            "I mean, no, I don't think so. I mean, let's see how I look at it. MySpace is a public thing, and a bulletin, you know? If you look at that definition, then you know that's basically to post for the public to see or for others to see. Whatever you're trying to get at, and now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it's school officials or not. So in my opinion, I think that school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But yeah, to prevent a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. I mean, let me see here. Like, if they go on to the internet, like on MySpace, just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble, and I think that's an invasion of privacy. But I think as long as they save lives, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. I mean, should I elaborate more on that? Yeah, I mean, okay, well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. But in order for them to express themselves, they need to be able to write.\n\nIn order for me to express myself, I'd rather write. Alright, well, like what I was saying, it's a public thing, and with a student posting something on MySpace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. I mean, everything, like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails. Like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that in an email because I'm afraid someone will pick it up and... you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, you know? If you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll find an email you sent somehow, and once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't think that's an invasion of privacy at all because, like I said before, it's a public thing. And well, that's basically all I've been saying, that it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here. Like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I think that's perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on. You know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like they're dropping them off at a safe place, and I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because we would do like lockdowns and stuff and... that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because, you know, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess. So we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. No, that's it.",
            "Okay, let's talk about war. At first, I was all for it because I was personally affected by 9/11. I was for going over there and causing as much chaos as they caused here. I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. We went there without a plan and were unprepared. I think that ultimately backfired on us. I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think we accomplished anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us as well. Like, I don't think us being there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. Unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've almost lost all feelings for what's going on over there. I just don't care about them. I don't think they're human, I don't know. They're just fighting with each other and can't get anything done, so I really don't care. We went over there completely unprepared, we didn't know what we were going to face over there. It's also bad because war is different for them than it is for us. They're like savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're looking to better their country, I think they're just looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. We were just hyped up, I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. We pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. But also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. At the time, I see where he was coming from, we really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, 'Okay, let's rebuild and that's it.' So, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order. I don't know, I just think that they didn't have any unity, they didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made progress, but not enough to stay in there. And I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. And we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views are a bit old-fashioned. They have strong opinions on many things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. I think this is one of the reasons why the Catholic Church is losing followers. They are not very open to many things. \n\nI think if they were to adapt a bit, they wouldn't lose as many followers. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because they don't share their views. They think the Catholic Church has the wrong views. If you're for abortion, for example, you might not feel comfortable in a community that believes abortion is wrong. The same goes for gay marriage and other things. If you believe the Catholic Church is wrong, you might not be able to join a community that upholds these views. I think there's no reason why priests can't get married or why there can't be female priests. But I'm not sure if that would have made a difference. \n\nIf priests got married or there were female priests, it might not have made a difference. It's hard to say if they would have acted differently. I think there's no reason why priests can't get married. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God, but I don't think that's the same as a marriage. Everyone has a job and a family and other people they love. Why shouldn't that be the same for priests?",
            "I personally don't oppose men getting married. I think one doesn't consciously decide whether to be gay or not. I think you shouldn't be held responsible for who you are. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this much thought, but I think it's wrong for them to say that. \n\nIt seems to me that it's not like a choice whether you're gay or not. I mean, you're either gay or straight, and that's something you can't actively choose. It's like being born gay or not, and I think it's wrong to hold someone responsible for their sexual orientation. \n\nI think the federal government shouldn't interfere because it's not a legal or moral issue. I mean, you should just accept who you are and not try to change someone. It's tough to exclude the federal government, but I think they shouldn't interfere because it's not their business. \n\nIt's hard to exclude them, but I think they shouldn't interfere because it's not their thing. It's not about national security or moral concerns, it's just that they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have the right to interfere in people's lives. And you know, that's who they are, the gay people, that's just how they were born, at least that's what I think, and I mean they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn’t a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but they are just different. It’s like two different sides of the same coin, and heads will never be tails, but it’s the same thing. There are many civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and healthcare, where your primary or next of kin can’t visit because they aren’t technically family. It’s silly to spend the rest of your life with someone but not be able to have them in the room with you if you’re sick. Many scientific studies have been done and they show that homosexual couples have the same success rates and the same factors that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It’s just a relationship, it’s the same thing. Where people get hung up is that homosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church, they’re asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no involvement with church and state, then it shouldn’t be an issue. The Catholic church can believe whatever they want, but it shouldn’t be an issue in a legal sense. If you’re allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It’s like segregation, separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the roles played by different partners and so on. People are worried about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. They are especially worried about children of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society, but it’s hard to say. The main drawback to adoption is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. In New York City, they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools, kids get bullied and beat up, and parents protest to get them removed from school. It’s just a kid, they have the same points of view and everything, and parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. They can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But President Bush has very strong views related to his religion. His views on gay marriage go along with his views on abortion and stem cell research, and most of the reasons I’ve heard are moral reasons. Morality is not always negotiable, but it differs from person to person. It’s not fair to embrace the morality of one group in America while ignoring the culture and morality of the rest. It’s not fair to go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the whole country. It’s hypocritical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage considering the recent controversy over “under God” in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are opposed to that but will let laws be made that enforce religious standards on the whole country. Many people are against gay people and gay marriage because they believe they are somehow psychologically damaged. The American Psychological Association has just put out a memo saying that is untrue. If people listened to institutions that actually do research and studies on these subjects instead of their neighbors and friends, and maybe what’s popular opinion in their culture and church, then the world would be seen a little bit differently. No.",

            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. I understand that it's not as strict as it used to be. I know, even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would wear cute little dresses. And I would wear matching shoes. And I would wear a matching purse. That was the case when I went to a private school. And I would see all my friends on the weekends. And we would just go. But now, as I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass. And they cut it down to 30 minutes. And people dress a lot more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes, straight from the beach. You'd have families there who are just running late. So I think it's become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. People are wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just a lot more casual compared to that. What I've noticed is that that's the biggest thing that's changed. That's the church I know. I don't know the politics of the church and whatnot. But yeah, that's it. [OK, what exactly do you have to say about the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia?] I don't think these things could have been prevented. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. I think even if you let them get married, it's just the person. It's not because they're allowed to get married or not. I also think that when they become a priest, it's their decision. There are religions where they're allowed to get married. For example, on Seventh Heaven. I don't know what kind of [a reverend or a minister or something]. [mm hmm] But they're allowed to get married. I know it's a little different. If they really want to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe choose a different faith. [OK, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, about the changes. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, pedophilia. [Mm hmm] I think like the whole thing, sexual attraction before, as if it were genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I don't think people become it. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with upbringing. It might have something to do a little bit in this case, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through a marriage. You could try, but then it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, but I don't think in all cases they knew. [OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] No",
            "I was initially okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still pretty much reeling from the 9/11 attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that the Bush administration was quick to connect the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general the Iraq war really boils my blood. I was initially for the Iraq war, but now I think it was a bad idea to think that we would find WMDs in Iraq. I think that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, I mean, after he came back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that is a perversion of the constitution, I think that is an impeachable offense because they lied to the American people. I think that the Bush administration completely disregards the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since September 11. Honestly, I think they had the intention to go to war from the start. I think they went into Iraq to secure their energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. I think it's gone on long enough, but I also think that if we withdraw now, there's a good chance that the country will plunge into civil war and even more people will die as a result. I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving towards now seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to try to restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea because I think it will also cause more problems in the long term because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major point of contention. I think the interim government is dissolving because it's not effective. I've heard that the parliament is not very effective and that the Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process or what's happening. And also Mugtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I think it was less than a year ago, his party now has at least 20 seats in the Iraqi parliament and I think we're still dealing with radical elements that are vying for control of the government. I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. I can't discuss this in polite company.",
            "I was thinking \nI mean, let's just talk about this? \nOkay, cool \nUh-huh \nUh \nOkay, sorry \nOkay \nHow do I feel about the war in Iraq? \nLet me see \nUh \nAt this point, I feel like it's kind of pointless because it's not even officially declared as a war \nAnd I think it was just a big revenge thing against Iraq because we thought they were the ones who bombed the U.S. \nYou know, like the 9/11 attacks \nSo I don't feel like \nI mean, I'm not a big fan of the war in Iraq \nSo I don't really keep up with it \nI don't know the big details of it \nBut at this point, I know we're just going to stay there and try to build democracy so it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd also so we can get oil and resources from them \nBut that's not a good reason to stay there because it's causing a lot of resentment \nSo \nAnd then, if we stay there, it's going to end up with us trying to build democracy, which is going to take forever because democracy can't be built in a day \nAnd then if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUh \nLet me think \nOh, this is so difficult \nThis is the one topic I don't know anything about \nUh \nWar in Iraq \nOh, this is hard \nUh \nMmm \nI don't know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOkay \nThanks \nUh \nWell, actually \nI think \nI think the war should continue because it's not fair \nI don't think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I think \nYou know \nI think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore \nBecause we didn't even declare it \nI think that's how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by Congress \nAnd then it's \nI just don't think it's a big deal to stay there and try to help them \nBut it's also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like \nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of what it's doing and it's like \nAnd what it's doing to \nRemember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nThe Vietnam War was an undeclared war and it's now considered a meaningless war \nAnd he's like saying \nHe'll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nDoesn't this have to be a half an hour? \nUh \nOkay, yeah \nUh \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to continue because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are just killing each other because of different beliefs \nBut then again \nIt's like \nIt's hard to say \nI want them to be there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there, we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nIt's going to be even worse for them \nAnd it's going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Qaeda thing is just going to get even bigger and their hatred towards the U.S. is just going to get even bigger because we're now trying to change them \nAnd they've been going on this whole totalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it's going to \nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat's it \nOkay",
            "I don't see how it would be right to make it constitutionally legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal because I think it's up to the churches, as it's even stated in the constitution, separation of church and state. It's clear that trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be in direct contradiction to what has already been said and written in the constitution. In terms of the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really just choosing one church's belief over another because most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas. I don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal. The decision of what's legal or illegal should be left up to the churches. Separation of church and state is basically a key aspect of the constitution and what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Although they thought about proposing an amendment, I think even proposing an amendment about it would be completely wrong and in direct contradiction to what's already been said and written there. I also think that it would be one of the few amendments that actually restricts the people rather than the government. So, I don't think that's right. No, I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic, and as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion. So I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular, and there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it, I think, by I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nWell, \nTo start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUh \nAnd I think that it's \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear, clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUh \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with a country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUh \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short, successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was a lot of tension and there was a civil war and \nUh \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUh \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell, that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUh \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is it too much to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue \nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions was before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nUh \nI just hope that it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I think I'm for gay marriage, I've always been. I really think it's a personal preference and it's something that's been proven more and more now that it's biological rather than sociological, so to give people less rights due to something that's really not under their control. I think it's kinda inhumane and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think there's any role for politics and government in this; it's not even at a state level, it's a personal level, a family level. I know two or three openly gay couples in my neighborhood who aren't married or anything because they're not allowed to, but they function the same way as any other family would. They walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to is kinda ridiculous.\n\nYeah, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different publications and TV reports or newspapers that it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain, something you might be predisposed to be gay. As opposed to growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know you don't have anything to do with it, so that would be the biological side rather than sociological.\n\nWell, other than the obvious, I think maybe because marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it they can do it without telling a single person, just run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it'll make the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it should be a personal, private, matter rather than a public and national issue.\n\nNo, no.",

            "I think the war has been going on for too long, I think the purpose in the beginning was good. To restore democracy in another country is a good purpose. But I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose and we're now maybe just doing it because we're doing it to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I also think the original motivations were questionable because of George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \n\nSo, I think if the original motivation was to give democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, if there were personal matters involved I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. I think we got our purpose across in the first couple of months just starting the war, I think that was a statement in and of itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too long.\n\nYeah, I think. I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think our reason over time has been deteriorated and misconceived. It seems like we're still at war just to go to war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive end, a victory or whatever.\n\nYeah, I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway, and I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf, like poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out.\n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our budget for the long term. There are obvious things like poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that, healthcare, that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for.",
            "Can I ask a question clarifying that it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like that\n\nO k, umm, no I don't think that's an invasion of privacy on sites such as Myspace if I mean if you post information on the internet it's pretty much available for everyone to see and I understand on Myspace you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile you might need to be their friend or something like that but if that's the case you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it you're giving them permission to see your profile so I mean anytime you put information on the internet you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that so if I think that was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think O let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything um I mean I don't think it would really be right to go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something so I don't really know\n\nYeah, um well, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook I do it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me and I saw something on TV once that was about this this man who just he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me and it's hard because you think that they know your interests they know what you look like sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day who your friends are they pretty much know a lot about you all sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends I don't want to limit it too much so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know I mean you never really know who can look at what so\n\nHum, uh, well I heard my roommate was telling me that her um high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that's the only other thought I can think of \n\nYes",

I mean, I hate to say you know, I hate joining the bandwagon of people who say I was against it from the beginning. Yeah, I was, but it's not really important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now, think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states, I mean, it's just too big a gap for this administration or previous administrations to understand. And they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that totally different people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's arguing that he wasn't, but, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them, I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that, but, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago, that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these people that we're trying to save, these people that we're trying to help, are telling us to leave. Yeah, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. If it completely goes to hell, we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we'll, I mean if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the US. \n\nNot just for women, I think it has to do with the specific field of work you're in. \n\nI mean, overall, I think women have it harder because of the \"glass ceiling\" where even with equal opportunities, most people have a hard time finding someone who works under a woman if they're a man. \n\nBecause society has been built this way for so long. \n\nAnd often in the workplace, women see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position just because historically, it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. \n\nAnd, I think the same goes for men. \n\nIn certain industries like fashion or raising children at home, it's really uncommon for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. \n\nAnd often, people will look down on them because society thinks, \"Well, you're a man, you should be working and making money, why are you staying at home?\" \n\nAnd it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and the woman has a better job. \n\nAnd it's working out fine for them, but society looks down on it. \n\nIn the fashion industry, it's often the case that people won't take straight men seriously who are interested in fashion. \n\nI don't know if that makes sense, but I think it's because men who are interested in fashion often have a different lifestyle. \n\nSo if you have a typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women, like you don't really know what our case is like, like the other guys.\" \n\nAnd depending on the field of work you're in, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the US. \n\nIt's hard to change because society has a set mindset, and we've made huge progress since the 1800s, but it's a slow process. \n\nIf we continue at the same rate because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, it's a long process. \n\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. \n\nAnd just like men who stay at home to raise their children, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh wait, maybe the woman has the better job or she wants to be the one working.\" \n\nAnd in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Oh wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or wives and stuff, so they do know where I'm coming from.\" \n\nSo maybe you have to promote it by showing the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against without being too pushy. \n\nIf you force it, people will resist. \n\nAnd I think we're in a good balance where it's starting to permeate that way. \n\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist. \n\nAnd we've made progress, and change takes time. \n\nYes, and... \n\nThere is also discrimination between genders, depending on the field of work you're in or where you're from. \n\nIf you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't that great, but you're extremely intelligent and you worked your way up to a CEO position, other men will look down on you because they'll say, \"I don't know if you really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right.\" \n\nSo it's sometimes like where you're from discriminates against you. \n\nAnd between genders. \n\nI don't know, I think that would be another example.",
            "I mean they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nAh \nThat knocked it down from a crime to like a traffic violation \nYou know it’s a crime you get punished for, but you don’t get arrested and taken to jail \nAh \nI think if someone gets caught and gets punished then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nI don’t think the negative consequences go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut there’s an argument that \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest someone and take them to a cell and book them and then let them go and then bring them to court maybe two times maybe three \nAnd then hire a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press charges \nI mean all these things cost a lot of money \nAnd I mean \nWhen you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble I mean a lot of them aren’t philosophically willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open-minded \nI have to use the word liberal \nI understand what I mean \nA kind of way of thinking \nThen I think it’s fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on social programs for seniors and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for homeless people \nAh \nI think it’s \nIt’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you want just lying around everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole financial aspect to it as well \nOther reasons why it shouldn’t be done \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel if it were completely legal \nI mean you could sell it like cigarettes in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be smoking and driving \nAnd it’s still taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nAh \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI think it would be uncomfortable for a lot of people \nAh \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is a bit low \nAh \nI don’t really know \nAh \nI think alcohol has more of a negative effect on your ability to drive \nAh \nI think marijuana has a more negative effect on a person’s lifestyle \nIn comparison to their decision making and control \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their negative effects \nAnd I mean when it comes to substances in general \nIt seems like no two people react the same \nI mean and some people have normal personalities and they just do everything they have \nAnd then there are people who can control themselves and then there are people who can’t \nSo \nI think it’s hard to make general statements about the substance when people react differently \nBut I do think they both have their negative effects \nAh \nYeah \nAh \nNo I don’t",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they've done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt's good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it's also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI think \nMany Catholics believe they have to go to Church every Sunday \nAnd \nUm \nThey're very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don't accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI'm sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad's religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat's not really \nLike \nTo say to love others and then not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI think a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it's so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don't think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don't think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nBecause it's just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don't think that that would be an issue \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it's a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you're going to do something like that \nYou're probably going to do it whether or not you're married \nLike \nI don't think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope",
            "I'm not sure, I haven't made up my mind on this matter yet. So I can't say if one side is right or wrong. But I believe this is the most complicated aspect we're facing today. Because there's something delicate about the separation of church and state. And defining marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending anyone. So I don't know, I think. I think that all civil unions are something that I don't know if marriage should be looked at as. And like defined by the government, since it's considered a sacrament. Well, people wouldn't get tax breaks or looked at any differently by the government if they were baptized. And so if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is. It's two people, they shouldn't have a separation of church and state, they shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was. Two people got united. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, that would just be two people who got a civil union. \n\nWell, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just absurd. It is something like the constitution shouldn't just be amended because it's a big issue for certain people. I mean it's a very big topic for some people. But it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Simply put. Uh no",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a gray area for me. \n\nBecause I have a lot of gay friends. \n\nI think that I don’t necessarily agree with that lifestyle. \n\nBut I think that it should be legalized. \n\nI don’t think it should be a national issue. \n\nHowever I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than something the president decides for the entire country. \n\nWell, like many states are democratic, so many also have republican governments. \n\nObviously democratic states are going to vote for gay marriage. \n\nAnd if you live in a democratic state, you already know how that state feels about that position. \n\nI don’t think you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. \n\nBecause you’ve already chosen to live there. \n\nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals. \n\nSo I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. \n\nWell I kind of already said that. \n\nNow, I don’t think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. \n\nI think it should be up to each individual state as to whether they want to legalize it. \n\nI don’t agree with his stance against gay marriage. \n\nI just think some things should be left up to each individual state. \n\nPlus he’s going to be out of office in about two years. \n\nAnd if a democratic president decides he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it’s just going to go back and forth. \n\nIt should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are going to have to live with that decision, not the president. \n\nNo I don’t.",
            "I mean, no, I don't think so. I mean, let's see how I look at it. MySpace is a public thing, and a bulletin, you know? If you look at that definition, then you know that's basically to post for the public to see or for others to see. Whatever you're trying to get at, and now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it's school officials or not. So in my opinion, I think that school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But yeah, to prevent a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. I mean, let me see here. Like, if they go on to the internet, like on MySpace, just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble, and I think that's an invasion of privacy. But I think as long as they save lives, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. I mean, should I elaborate more on that? Yeah, I mean, okay, well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. But in order for them to express themselves, they need to be able to write.\n\nIn order for me to express myself, I'd rather write. Alright, well, like what I was saying, it's a public thing, and with a student posting something on MySpace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. I mean, everything, like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails. Like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that in an email because I'm afraid someone will pick it up and... you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, you know? If you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll find an email you sent somehow, and once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't think that's an invasion of privacy at all because, like I said before, it's a public thing. And well, that's basically all I've been saying, that it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here. Like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I think that's perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on. You know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like they're dropping them off at a safe place, and I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because we would do like lockdowns and stuff and... that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because, you know, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess. So we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. No, that's it.",
            "Okay, let's talk about war. At first, I was all for it because I was personally affected by 9/11. I was for going over there and causing as much chaos as they caused here. I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. We went there without a plan and were unprepared. I think that ultimately backfired on us. I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think we accomplished anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us as well. Like, I don't think us being there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. Unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've almost lost all feelings for what's going on over there. I just don't care about them. I don't think they're human, I don't know. They're just fighting with each other and can't get anything done, so I really don't care. We went over there completely unprepared, we didn't know what we were going to face over there. It's also bad because war is different for them than it is for us. They're like savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're looking to better their country, I think they're just looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. We were just hyped up, I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. We pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. But also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. At the time, I see where he was coming from, we really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, 'Okay, let's rebuild and that's it.' So, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order. I don't know, I just think that they didn't have any unity, they didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made progress, but not enough to stay in there. And I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. And we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views are a bit old-fashioned. They have strong opinions on many things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. I think this is one of the reasons why the Catholic Church is losing followers. They are not very open to many things. \n\nI think if they were to adapt a bit, they wouldn't lose as many followers. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because they don't share their views. They think the Catholic Church has the wrong views. If you're for abortion, for example, you might not feel comfortable in a community that believes abortion is wrong. The same goes for gay marriage and other things. If you believe the Catholic Church is wrong, you might not be able to join a community that upholds these views. I think there's no reason why priests can't get married or why there can't be female priests. But I'm not sure if that would have made a difference. \n\nIf priests got married or there were female priests, it might not have made a difference. It's hard to say if they would have acted differently. I think there's no reason why priests can't get married. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God, but I don't think that's the same as a marriage. Everyone has a job and a family and other people they love. Why shouldn't that be the same for priests?",
            "I personally don't oppose men getting married. I think one doesn't consciously decide whether to be gay or not. I think you shouldn't be held responsible for who you are. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this much thought, but I think it's wrong for them to say that. \n\nIt seems to me that it's not like a choice whether you're gay or not. I mean, you're either gay or straight, and that's something you can't actively choose. It's like being born gay or not, and I think it's wrong to hold someone responsible for their sexual orientation. \n\nI think the federal government shouldn't interfere because it's not a legal or moral issue. I mean, you should just accept who you are and not try to change someone. It's tough to exclude the federal government, but I think they shouldn't interfere because it's not their business. \n\nIt's hard to exclude them, but I think they shouldn't interfere because it's not their thing. It's not about national security or moral concerns, it's just that they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have the right to interfere in people's lives. And you know, that's who they are, the gay people, that's just how they were born, at least that's what I think, and I mean they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn’t a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but they are just different. It’s like two different sides of the same coin, and heads will never be tails, but it’s the same thing. There are many civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and healthcare, where your primary or next of kin can’t visit because they aren’t technically family. It’s silly to spend the rest of your life with someone but not be able to have them in the room with you if you’re sick. Many scientific studies have been done and they show that homosexual couples have the same success rates and the same factors that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It’s just a relationship, it’s the same thing. Where people get hung up is that homosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church, they’re asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no involvement with church and state, then it shouldn’t be an issue. The Catholic church can believe whatever they want, but it shouldn’t be an issue in a legal sense. If you’re allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It’s like segregation, separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the roles played by different partners and so on. People are worried about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. They are especially worried about children of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society, but it’s hard to say. The main drawback to adoption is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. In New York City, they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools, kids get bullied and beat up, and parents protest to get them removed from school. It’s just a kid, they have the same points of view and everything, and parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. They can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But President Bush has very strong views related to his religion. His views on gay marriage go along with his views on abortion and stem cell research, and most of the reasons I’ve heard are moral reasons. Morality is not always negotiable, but it differs from person to person. It’s not fair to embrace the morality of one group in America while ignoring the culture and morality of the rest. It’s not fair to go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the whole country. It’s hypocritical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage considering the recent controversy over “under God” in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are opposed to that but will let laws be made that enforce religious standards on the whole country. Many people are against gay people and gay marriage because they believe they are somehow psychologically damaged. The American Psychological Association has just put out a memo saying that is untrue. If people listened to institutions that actually do research and studies on these subjects instead of their neighbors and friends, and maybe what’s popular opinion in their culture and church, then the world would be seen a little bit differently. No.",

            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. I understand that it's not as strict as it used to be. I know, even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would wear cute little dresses. And I would wear matching shoes. And I would wear a matching purse. That was the case when I went to a private school. And I would see all my friends on the weekends. And we would just go. But now, as I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass. And they cut it down to 30 minutes. And people dress a lot more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes, straight from the beach. You'd have families there who are just running late. So I think it's become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. People are wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just a lot more casual compared to that. What I've noticed is that that's the biggest thing that's changed. That's the church I know. I don't know the politics of the church and whatnot. But yeah, that's it. [OK, what exactly do you have to say about the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia?] I don't think these things could have been prevented. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. I think even if you let them get married, it's just the person. It's not because they're allowed to get married or not. I also think that when they become a priest, it's their decision. There are religions where they're allowed to get married. For example, on Seventh Heaven. I don't know what kind of [a reverend or a minister or something]. [mm hmm] But they're allowed to get married. I know it's a little different. If they really want to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe choose a different faith. [OK, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, about the changes. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, pedophilia. [Mm hmm] I think like the whole thing, sexual attraction before, as if it were genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I don't think people become it. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with upbringing. It might have something to do a little bit in this case, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through a marriage. You could try, but then it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, but I don't think in all cases they knew. [OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] No",
            "I was initially okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still pretty much reeling from the 9/11 attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that the Bush administration was quick to connect the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general the Iraq war really boils my blood. I was initially for the Iraq war, but now I think it was a bad idea to think that we would find WMDs in Iraq. I think that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, I mean, after he came back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that is a perversion of the constitution, I think that is an impeachable offense because they lied to the American people. I think that the Bush administration completely disregards the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since September 11. Honestly, I think they had the intention to go to war from the start. I think they went into Iraq to secure their energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. I think it's gone on long enough, but I also think that if we withdraw now, there's a good chance that the country will plunge into civil war and even more people will die as a result. I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving towards now seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to try to restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea because I think it will also cause more problems in the long term because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major point of contention. I think the interim government is dissolving because it's not effective. I've heard that the parliament is not very effective and that the Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process or what's happening. And also Mugtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I think it was less than a year ago, his party now has at least 20 seats in the Iraqi parliament and I think we're still dealing with radical elements that are vying for control of the government. I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. I can't discuss this in polite company.",
            "I was thinking \nI mean, let's just talk about this? \nOkay, cool \nUh-huh \nUh \nOkay, sorry \nOkay \nHow do I feel about the war in Iraq? \nLet me see \nUh \nAt this point, I feel like it's kind of pointless because it's not even officially declared as a war \nAnd I think it was just a big revenge thing against Iraq because we thought they were the ones who bombed the U.S. \nYou know, like the 9/11 attacks \nSo I don't feel like \nI mean, I'm not a big fan of the war in Iraq \nSo I don't really keep up with it \nI don't know the big details of it \nBut at this point, I know we're just going to stay there and try to build democracy so it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd also so we can get oil and resources from them \nBut that's not a good reason to stay there because it's causing a lot of resentment \nSo \nAnd then, if we stay there, it's going to end up with us trying to build democracy, which is going to take forever because democracy can't be built in a day \nAnd then if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUh \nLet me think \nOh, this is so difficult \nThis is the one topic I don't know anything about \nUh \nWar in Iraq \nOh, this is hard \nUh \nMmm \nI don't know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOkay \nThanks \nUh \nWell, actually \nI think \nI think the war should continue because it's not fair \nI don't think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I think \nYou know \nI think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore \nBecause we didn't even declare it \nI think that's how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by Congress \nAnd then it's \nI just don't think it's a big deal to stay there and try to help them \nBut it's also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like \nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of what it's doing and it's like \nAnd what it's doing to \nRemember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nThe Vietnam War was an undeclared war and it's now considered a meaningless war \nAnd he's like saying \nHe'll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nDoesn't this have to be a half an hour? \nUh \nOkay, yeah \nUh \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to continue because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are just killing each other because of different beliefs \nBut then again \nIt's like \nIt's hard to say \nI want them to be there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there, we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nIt's going to be even worse for them \nAnd it's going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Qaeda thing is just going to get even bigger and their hatred towards the U.S. is just going to get even bigger because we're now trying to change them \nAnd they've been going on this whole totalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it's going to \nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat's it \nOkay",
            "I don't see how it would be right to make it constitutionally legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal because I think it's up to the churches, as it's even stated in the constitution, separation of church and state. It's clear that trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be in direct contradiction to what has already been said and written in the constitution. In terms of the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really just choosing one church's belief over another because most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas. I don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal. The decision of what's legal or illegal should be left up to the churches. Separation of church and state is basically a key aspect of the constitution and what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Although they thought about proposing an amendment, I think even proposing an amendment about it would be completely wrong and in direct contradiction to what's already been said and written there. I also think that it would be one of the few amendments that actually restricts the people rather than the government. So, I don't think that's right. No, I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic, and as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion. So I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular, and there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else, if anything, it could possibly boost it, I think, by I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nWell, \nTo start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUh \nAnd I think that it's \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear, clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUh \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nSo I think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with a country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUh \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short, successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was a lot of tension and there was a civil war and \nUh \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUh \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell, that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUh \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see it through to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is it too much to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue \nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from \nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources \nI mean because another one of the predispositions was before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction \nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found \nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we're not making any attacks against them \nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see \nUh \nI just hope that it ends soon \nAnd there will be peace there soon \nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I think I'm for gay marriage, I've always been. I really think it's a personal preference and it's something that's been proven more and more now that it's biological rather than sociological, so to give people less rights due to something that's really not under their control. I think it's kinda inhumane and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think there's any role for politics and government in this; it's not even at a state level, it's a personal level, a family level. I know two or three openly gay couples in my neighborhood who aren't married or anything because they're not allowed to, but they function the same way as any other family would. They walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to is kinda ridiculous.\n\nYeah, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different publications and TV reports or newspapers that it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain, something you might be predisposed to be gay. As opposed to growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know you don't have anything to do with it, so that would be the biological side rather than sociological.\n\nWell, other than the obvious, I think maybe because marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it they can do it without telling a single person, just run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it'll make the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it should be a personal, private, matter rather than a public and national issue.\n\nNo, no.",

            "I think the war has been going on for too long, I think the purpose in the beginning was good. To restore democracy in another country is a good purpose. But I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose and we're now maybe just doing it because we're doing it to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I also think the original motivations were questionable because of George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \n\nSo, I think if the original motivation was to give democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, if there were personal matters involved I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. I think we got our purpose across in the first couple of months just starting the war, I think that was a statement in and of itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too long.\n\nYeah, I think. I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think our reason over time has been deteriorated and misconceived. It seems like we're still at war just to go to war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive end, a victory or whatever.\n\nYeah, I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway, and I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf, like poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out.\n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our budget for the long term. There are obvious things like poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that, healthcare, that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for.",
            "Can I ask a question clarifying that it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like that\n\nO k, umm, no I don't think that's an invasion of privacy on sites such as Myspace if I mean if you post information on the internet it's pretty much available for everyone to see and I understand on Myspace you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile you might need to be their friend or something like that but if that's the case you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it you're giving them permission to see your profile so I mean anytime you put information on the internet you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that so if I think that was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think O let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything um I mean I don't think it would really be right to go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something so I don't really know\n\nYeah, um well, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook I do it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me and I saw something on TV once that was about this this man who just he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me and it's hard because you think that they know your interests they know what you look like sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day who your friends are they pretty much know a lot about you all sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends I don't want to limit it too much so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know I mean you never really know who can look at what so\n\nHum, uh, well I heard my roommate was telling me that her um high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that's the only other thought I can think of \n\nYes",

I mean, I hate to say you know, I hate joining the bandwagon of people who say I was against it from the beginning. Yeah, I was, but it's not really important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now, think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states, I mean, it's just too big a gap for this administration or previous administrations to understand. And they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that totally different people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's arguing that he wasn't, but, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them, I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that, but, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago, that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these people that we're trying to save, these people that we're trying to help, are telling us to leave. Yeah, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. If it completely goes to hell, we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we'll, I mean if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys, kind of, not really, no, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the US. \n\nNot just for women, I think it has to do with the specific field of work you're in. \n\nI mean, overall, I think women have it harder because of the \"glass ceiling\" where even with equal opportunities, most people have a hard time finding someone who works under a woman if they're a man. \n\nBecause society has been built this way for so long. \n\nAnd often in the workplace, women see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position just because historically, it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. \n\nAnd, I think the same goes for men. \n\nIn certain industries like fashion or raising children at home, it's really uncommon for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. \n\nAnd often, people will look down on them because society thinks, \"Well, you're a man, you should be working and making money, why are you staying at home?\" \n\nAnd it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and the woman has a better job. \n\nAnd it's working out fine for them, but society looks down on it. \n\nIn the fashion industry, it's often the case that people won't take straight men seriously who are interested in fashion. \n\nI don't know if that makes sense, but I think it's because men who are interested in fashion often have a different lifestyle. \n\nSo if you have a typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women, like you don't really know what our case is like, like the other guys.\" \n\nAnd depending on the field of work you're in, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the US. \n\nIt's hard to change because society has a set mindset, and we've made huge progress since the 1800s, but it's a slow process. \n\nIf we continue at the same rate because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, it's a long process. \n\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. \n\nAnd just like men who stay at home to raise their children, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh wait, maybe the woman has the better job or she wants to be the one working.\" \n\nAnd in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Oh wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or wives and stuff, so they do know where I'm coming from.\" \n\nSo maybe you have to promote it by showing the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against without being too pushy. \n\nIf you force it, people will resist. \n\nAnd I think we're in a good balance where it's starting to permeate that way. \n\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist. \n\nAnd we've made progress, and change takes time. \n\nYes, and... \n\nThere is also discrimination between genders, depending on the field of work you're in or where you're from. \n\nIf you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't that great, but you're extremely intelligent and you worked your way up to a CEO position, other men will look down on you because they'll say, \"I don't know if you really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right.\" \n\nSo it's sometimes like where you're from discriminates against you. \n\nAnd between genders. \n\nI don't know, I think that would be another example.",
            "I mean they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nAh \nThat knocked it down from a crime to like a traffic violation \nYou know it’s a crime you get punished for, but you don’t get arrested and taken to jail \nAh \nI think if someone gets caught and gets punished then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nI don’t think the negative consequences go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut there’s an argument that \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest someone and take them to a cell and book them and then let them go and then bring them to court maybe two times maybe three \nAnd then hire a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press charges \nI mean all these things cost a lot of money \nAnd I mean \nWhen you look at municipalities that are financially in trouble I mean a lot of them aren’t philosophically willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open-minded \nI have to use the word liberal \nI understand what I mean \nA kind of way of thinking \nThen I think it’s fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on social programs for seniors and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for homeless people \nAh \nI think it’s \nIt’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you want just lying around everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole financial aspect to it as well \nOther reasons why it shouldn’t be done \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel if it were completely legal \nI mean you could sell it like cigarettes in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be smoking and driving \nAnd it’s still taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nAh \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI think it would be uncomfortable for a lot of people \nAh \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is a bit low \nAh \nI don’t really know \nAh \nI think alcohol has more of a negative effect on your ability to drive \nAh \nI think marijuana has a more negative effect on a person’s lifestyle \nIn comparison to their decision making and control \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their negative effects \nAnd I mean when it comes to substances in general \nIt seems like no two people react the same \nI mean and some people have normal personalities and they just do everything they have \nAnd then there are people who can control themselves and then there are people who can’t \nSo \nI think it’s hard to make general statements about the substance when people react differently \nBut I do think they both have their negative effects \nAh \nYeah \nAh \nNo I don’t",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they've done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt's good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it's also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI think \nMany Catholics believe they have to go to Church every Sunday \nAnd \nUm \nThey're very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don't accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI'm sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad's religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat's not really \nLike \nTo say to love others and then not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI think a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it's so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don't think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don't think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nBecause it's just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don't think that that would be an issue \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it's a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you're going to do something like that \nYou're probably going to do it whether or not you're married \nLike \nI don't think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope",
            "I'm not sure, I haven't made up my mind on this matter yet. So I can't say if one side is right or wrong. But I believe this is the most complicated aspect we're facing today. Because there's something delicate about the separation of church and state. And defining marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending anyone. So I don't know, I think. I think that all civil unions are something that I don't know if marriage should be looked at as. And like defined by the government, since it's considered a sacrament. Well, people wouldn't get tax breaks or looked at any differently by the government if they were baptized. And so if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is. It's two people, they shouldn't have a separation of church and state, they shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was. Two people got united. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, that would just be two people who got a civil union. \n\nWell, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just absurd. It is something like the constitution shouldn't just be amended because it's a big issue for certain people. I mean it's a very big topic for some people. But it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Simply put. Uh no",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a gray area for me. \n\nBecause I have a lot of gay friends. \n\nI think that I don’t necessarily agree with that lifestyle. \n\nBut I think that it should be legalized. \n\nI don’t think it should be a national issue. \n\nHowever I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than something the president decides for the entire country. \n\nWell, like many states are democratic, so many also have republican governments. \n\nObviously democratic states are going to vote for gay marriage. \n\nAnd if you live in a democratic state, you already know how that state feels about that position. \n\nI don’t think you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. \n\nBecause you’ve already chosen to live there. \n\nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals. \n\nSo I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. \n\nWell I kind of already said that. \n\nNow, I don’t think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. \n\nI think it should be up to each individual state as to whether they want to legalize it. \n\nI don’t agree with his stance against gay marriage. \n\nI just think some things should be left up to each individual state. \n\nPlus he’s going to be out of office in about two years. \n\nAnd if a democratic president decides he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it’s just going to go back and forth. \n\nIt should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are going to have to live with that decision, not the president. \n\nNo I don’t.",
            "I mean, no, I don't think so. I mean, let's see how I look at it. MySpace is a public thing, and a bulletin, you know? If you look at that definition, then you know that's basically to post for the public to see or for others to see. Whatever you're trying to get at, and now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it's school officials or not. So in my opinion, I think that school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But yeah, to prevent a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. I mean, let me see here. Like, if they go on to the internet, like on MySpace, just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble, and I think that's an invasion of privacy. But I think as long as they save lives, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. I mean, should I elaborate more on that? Yeah, I mean, okay, well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. But in order for them to express themselves, they need to be able to write.\n\nIn order for me to express myself, I'd rather write. Alright, well, like what I was saying, it's a public thing, and with a student posting something on MySpace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. I mean, everything, like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails. Like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that in an email because I'm afraid someone will pick it up and... you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, you know? If you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll find an email you sent somehow, and once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't think that's an invasion of privacy at all because, like I said before, it's a public thing. And well, that's basically all I've been saying, that it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here. Like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I think that's perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on. You know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like they're dropping them off at a safe place, and I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because we would do like lockdowns and stuff and... that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because, you know, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess. So we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. No, that's it.",
            "Okay, let's talk about war. At first, I was all for it because I was personally affected by 9/11. I was for going over there and causing as much chaos as they caused here. I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. We went there without a plan and were unprepared. I think that ultimately backfired on us. I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think we accomplished anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us as well. Like, I don't think us being there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. Unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've almost lost all feelings for what's going on over there. I just don't care about them. I don't think they're human, I don't know. They're just fighting with each other and can't get anything done, so I really don't care. We went over there completely unprepared, we didn't know what we were going to face over there. It's also bad because war is different for them than it is for us. They're like savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're looking to better their country, I think they're just looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. We were just hyped up, I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. We pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. But also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. At the time, I see where he was coming from, we really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, 'Okay, let's rebuild and that's it.' So, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order. I don't know, I just think that they didn't have any unity, they didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made progress, but not enough to stay in there. And I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. And we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay."
