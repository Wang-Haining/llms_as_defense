            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views are quite outdated in some aspects, and I think the Church is losing followers because it's not very accepting of many things. Within the cases of gay marriages, abortion, and birth control, the Church has strong views, which is fine, but they seem old-fashioned to me. I think if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because of their views on these situations and because people disagree with them on certain subjects. Therefore, I think the Church has the wrong view on things. I mean, the Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a community where it's taught to be completely wrong and you're against it. The same goes for gay marriage, where if you believe in it and want to do it or feel strongly about it, you might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with it. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or have female priests, but I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. Maybe they wouldn't have done it if they were allowed to be married or have women priests, but I don't know if that would have necessarily changed things. I mean, that was something they did, and it didn't seem to be affected. If they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to tell. I don't see why priests can't be married. The Church says that priests are married to God, but everyone else in the world has a job and a family life. I don't see why priests can't have both. No.",
            "I personally think it's okay for gay couples to get married. I believe it's not just a matter of choice, but also a part of biology. I don't think it's a conscious decision. Gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about the topic, but I'd definitely say it's wrong to say that. It seems it's not really a choice; they don't really have a choice in who they are. Like, I was born straight, and I guess another person is born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held responsible for. I'd definitely think it's wrong to say they made a wrong decision. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not something affecting our country's security or moral issues. It just seems like they're out of place. They don't seem to have the right to intervene in people's lives. That's just who they are - gay people, that's how they were born, at least that's what I think. And they shouldn't be punished for that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security concern or a moral issue; it's just not their place. It's hard. I think the federal government shouldn't be involved because it has nothing to do with our country's security or moral issues. They're just out of place, and it doesn't seem like they have the right to intervene in people's lives.

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's simply no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin; heads will never be tails. But it's like the same thing, and there are a lot of civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing, where your primary or next of kin can't even be in the room with you if you're sick. It's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone and lots of scientific studies have been done, and homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. I don't understand where people, like Catholics, get hung up on saying it's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing. But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yes, they are the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation, or not. But again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption, because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean they're going to have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But I think President Bush has very strong views of his own to do with his religion. Well, his take on gay marriage actually goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research, which I think most of the reasons I've heard at least in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the culture and morality of all the rest is hypocritical of the government, considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay-marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "At the beginning I was okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks and I think we went into Iraq as a pretext - there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and claimed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general the Iraq war still boils my blood. \n\nUm, It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been very openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since 9/11, at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. Um, That last part I forget the name of the Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. Um, But it seems to me that the younger Bush had a kind of bloodlust against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. Well, I do think it's gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. Um, I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order, but I don't necessarily know that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the parliament is very effective at all, that um, Oh I don't remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government, and I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. Um, (laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I was thinking \nMmhmm \nShould I just talk about it? \nOk \nOk, that would be cool \nUh huh \nUh \nSorry, I'm done \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me think \nBut at this point, I feel like it's pointless because it's not even a declared war actually \nI mean, it was just a revenge thing against Iraq because we thought they carried out the 9/11 attacks \nSo I feel like \nI mean, I'm not a big fan of the War in Iraq \nI don't keep up with it \nI don't know the details \nBut at this point, I know that we're staying over there to try and build a democratic system so that it can feel like another U.S. place \nAnd also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut there's no reason for us to stay over there because it's making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd if we stay over there then what's going to end up happening is we have to try and build a democratic system which is going to take forever because a democratic system can't be built in just a day \nAnd then if we leave they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me think \nOh, this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I know the least about \nUm \nIraq War \nOh, this is hard \nUh \nMmm \nI don't know \nDo you have anything I can go by? \nOk \nThanks \nUm \nWell, actually I think \nI think the war should continue because it's not fair \nI don't think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I think \nYou know \nI think the only reason we use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn't even declare it \nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it was never declared by Congress \nI think that's how it works \nYou have to declare a war with Congress \nAnd then it's \nI just don't think it's a big point to still stay over there and try \nActually not \nI do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them \nBut it's also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like \nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of what it's doing and it's like \nAnd what it's doing to \nRemember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nThe Vietnam War was an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war \nAnd he's like saying \nHe'll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nYou have to make this in 30 minutes, don't you? \nUh \nOk, yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt's like \nIt's hard to say \nI want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it's going to be even worse for them \nAnd it's going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them \nAnd they've been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it's going to \nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat's it \nOk",
            "I don't feel comfortable with this\nIt's not right, that it's legalized or declared legal by a state\nI think it's really up to the churches, because in the constitution it says there's a step between church and state\nIt's clear\nIt's clear\nUh\nIt's\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it \nTrying to exert any kind of power over it \nWould be in defiance of what has already been said and written\nSo \nUh\nAs for the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really a stance of one church against another\nBecause we can see that most Catholics \nUh\nCatholics and Christians are really against it\nAnd don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um\nI don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd although they planned on making an amendment\nI think even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contrary to what's already been said and written\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don't feel that's right\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion\nSo I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don't know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society \nThan it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Okay\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other\nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nUm \nI \nI myself am against war and \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is in many ways \nA \nA repeat of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with\n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing was that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into the war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and the Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard cause once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to its finish but them again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil factor\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let’s see, I’m for gay marriage, I've always been. I think it's a personal preference and what has been proven more and more now is that it could be biological, rather than sociological, so people shouldn't be given less rights just because it's not their control. I think it's inhumane to give them less rights. And I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think there should be any influence from the state and government in this, it's a personal matter, a household matter. You know, in my neighborhood at home there are, I think, two or three openly gay couples who aren't, you know, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way as any other family would. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that with Bush trying to play God and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, it's kind of ridiculous.\n\nYes, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from various different publications and TV reports or newspapers, that it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain; it's something they might be predisposed to be homosexual. Instead of growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know you don't have a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side, opposed to the sociological.\n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that marriage is something that, if a man and a woman want to do it, they can just go to Vegas and do it without telling a single person, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to be on the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's something that should be a personal, private matter, rather than public domain and national, federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum. It's completely public. You can't. I mean, as an R.A., it's something I've actually had to deal with already. When you put something out there, it's going to color people's opinions of you. And if you're talking about blowing things up or if you're talking about shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there, put it to the world. The internet is seen by everybody. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin. Obviously it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school and they have to act on that. They can't just let it sit because then, God forbid, something happens, they could have prevented it. [Right] But you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. Sorry, couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think. What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through a friend of his Facebook and got very worried because there were certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friend-ing their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking. And going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs and if it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Um. Yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Um. Not really.",

I hate joining the bandwagon of people who are like, \"I was against it from the beginning.\" I was against it, but it's not that important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit that they were wrong. And you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now, think it was a stupid idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration, or previous administrations, to understand. They think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's disputing that. But you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand from when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And these are the people that we're trying to save, that we're trying to help. They're telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then we know it's not on us if something happens. If it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in, but you guys made the decision not to, and then we'll at least... I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys. Kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But you know, it'll be better than where we are, where we stand right now.",
            "I feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. Um, and it's not just with women, but also with men. I think it has to do with the specific field of work you're dealing with. Um, I mean, overall, I think women have it harder because there's the glass ceiling where, even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time recognizing that they can work under a woman if they're a man. It's due to how society has been raised for so long. And often in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. And um, I think the same thing goes for men, and like in other industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really uncommon for a man to be the one staying at home. Um, a lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh, you're a man, you should be working, you should be the breadwinner of your family, why are you staying at home? And it can be really hard on them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe their wife has a better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that. And in the fashion industry, um, a lot of times people won't take straight men seriously. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I think it's because typically men who are into fashion, um, like they have different lifestyles, and so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women, if you're not really, like, in that case? And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Um, to change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and obviously, we've made great strides since the 1800s, in many areas, but the change is very slow, and I think that if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more, and just like men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh, maybe the woman has a better job or she wants to be the one working, and um, then for people in fashion, they'll be like, oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives and so they know where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them, because if you force it, people will resist, and I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, it's like people will resist, and we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time. Yes, um, well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you may not have the best grammar in the world, and or even though you may be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, well, how do I really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right, so yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example, um, not really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it. They decriminalized it, which means they no longer considered it a crime. It got knocked down from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket; you know, something you get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean, usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about, are the future ramifications, and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time, there’s an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. When you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of on the open-minded track, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on food programs for homeless people. I mean, so I think it’s important because marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and about everywhere. I mean, there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized, not just financial. Other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized. Well no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well, if it were totally legal, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be smoking and driving. And it’s still like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana. So, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. I mean, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think marijuana has a more negative impact on a lot of people’s lives, as opposed to just their decision making and motor skills. I mean, but they both have their negative effects, and I mean, when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. So, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own negative effects. Um, yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes. Because many of the things they do are very traditional like they've been doing the same things for a long time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe you have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was Episcopalian, no my dad was Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm it might but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. People who molest children would probably do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",
            "I don't know \nI haven't really made a decision on this matter \nSo \nI can't say if either side is right or wrong \nBut \nI believe that this is the most difficult point we're facing today \nBecause \nSomething that's so close to the separation of church and state \nAnd \nHow to define marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending someone \nSo \nI don't know, I think \nI think that all civil unions \nI don't know if marriage should be seen that way \nAnd \nLike \nDefined by the government \nSince it's considered a sacrament \nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr \nBe looked at in a specific way by the government if they were baptized \nAnd \nSo \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause \nThat's what it is \nIt's two people \nThere shouldn't be a separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was \nTwo people got together \nSo \nAnd \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat's just \nOh two people who entered a civil union \n\nUm \nWell if all the states come to a logical conclusion, they should try to make it federal law \nBut \nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is simply ridiculous \nIt is \nSomething that the constitution shouldn't be changed for \nI mean it's a very big issue for some people \nBut \nIt's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment \n\nIt's just not important enough to change the constitution \nTo ban \nTo ban gay marriage \nSimply put \n\nUh \nNo",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like \nHomosexuality is kind of a gray area for me \nBecause \nI have a lot of gay friends \nUm \nI think that I don't necessarily agree with this lifestyle \nBut \nI think it should be legalized \nI don't think it should be a national issue \nHowever I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than \nUm \nLike \nThe president deciding for the entire country \n\nUm \nWell, like many states are democratic \nAnd \nMany states are Republican \nObviously democratic states are going to push for gay marriage \nAnd \nUm \nIf you're living in a democratic state \nLike obviously you know how that state feels about that position \nAnd \nUm \nI don't think you're necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage \nBecause \nLike \nYou kind of chose to live there \nYou know \nSo I \nLike \nI think \nI don't \nI think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals so \nI feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state \n\nWell I kind of already answered that \nBut \n\nUm \nYeah I don't feel as though \nUm \nBush should be allowed to \nUm \nDecide \nUm \nUm \nThat the whole country should be against gay marriage \nI think that it should be up to the \nUm \nIndividual states as to whether they want to legalize it \nI don't agree with his ban on it \n\nUm \nI just \nI just don't think \nLike \nI don't think that \nLike Bush doesn't live in every single state \nSo \nHe shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to govern \nUm \nItself I guess I don't know \nUm \nSo \nI think that \nUm \nSome things should be left up to \nUm \nEach individual state \nPlus he's going to be out of office in like two years \nAnd \nIf a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage \nLike \nIt's just going to go back and forth \nIt should just be up to each individual state \nBecause \nThey're the ones that are going to have to live with that decision \nNot the president \n\nNo I don't",
            "No, I don't think so at all, I mean. Let's see how I see it. In my opinion, Myspace is a public thing, and a bulletin. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know that's just enough reason to post for the public to see or for others to see. Whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you know you have to realize that people will see that, whether it be school officials or not. So, in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it. Because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But, uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Let me see here. Like, you know, if they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble. And I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. But I feel as though, you know, as long as they save lives, or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that?\n\nYeah, I mean, okay. Well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. But\n\nOkay, well, I mean, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. I mean, everything, like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid someone will pick that up and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, I guess you could say.\n\nLike, you know, if you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll like find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble. And I don't think it's not an invasion of privacy because, you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying, it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here.\n\nI mean, like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them or other officials, such as the police, to go on. You know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they said, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff and, uh, that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, because, uh, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess. So we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school safer, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Yeah, that's basically all I can come up with.\n\nUh, no, that's about it.",
            "Okay, I initially thought it was the right thing to do because I was personally affected by September 11. Um, I was for going over there and causing as much chaos as they had caused over here. Um, I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. And we kind of just went over there unprepared, without a plan. Um, I think it backfired on us. Um, I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it, I don't think it achieved anything. Um, I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like I don't think our being over there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. So um, like unfortunately because of September 11, I've almost lost interest in what's going on over there. Um, with those people, I just don't care, I just think, I don't think they're human sometimes. I don't know, they just can't stop fighting with each other and can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care, um, I don't know, we definitely went over there unprepared, we didn't know what we were going to face over there. Um, and it's also bad because war for them is totally different than war for us, they're just like savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're interested in improving their country, I just think they're interested in getting us out of there. And I think that would be fine for us, I think we should just leave and that's it. Um, we just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything, I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay, let's rebuild and that's it. So um, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do, I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order, and I don't know, I just think they didn't, there was no unity, they didn't know what they were going into, so I think that would have helped us a lot more, but like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say, it's gone on for long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress, like we've made progress but not enough to stay there, and I think no matter how long we stay there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse, and we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay."

heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views are quite outdated in some aspects, and I think the Church is losing followers because it's not very accepting of many things. Within the cases of gay marriages, abortion, and birth control, the Church has strong views, which is fine, but they seem old-fashioned to me. I think if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because of their views on these situations and because people disagree with them on certain subjects. Therefore, I think the Church has the wrong view on things. I mean, the Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a community where it's taught to be completely wrong and you're against it. The same goes for gay marriage, where if you believe in it and want to do it or feel strongly about it, you might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with it. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or have female priests, but I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. Maybe they wouldn't have done it if they were allowed to be married or have women priests, but I don't know if that would have necessarily changed things. I mean, that was something they did, and it didn't seem to be affected. If they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to tell. I don't see why priests can't be married. The Church says that priests are married to God, but everyone else in the world has a job and a family life. I don't see why priests can't have both. No.",
            "I personally think it's okay for gay couples to get married. I believe it's not just a matter of choice, but also a part of biology. I don't think it's a conscious decision. Gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about the topic, but I'd definitely say it's wrong to say that. It seems it's not really a choice; they don't really have a choice in who they are. Like, I was born straight, and I guess another person is born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held responsible for. I'd definitely think it's wrong to say they made a wrong decision. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not something affecting our country's security or moral issues. It just seems like they're out of place. They don't seem to have the right to intervene in people's lives. That's just who they are - gay people, that's how they were born, at least that's what I think. And they shouldn't be punished for that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security concern or a moral issue; it's just not their place. It's hard. I think the federal government shouldn't be involved because it has nothing to do with our country's security or moral issues. They're just out of place, and it doesn't seem like they have the right to intervene in people's lives.

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's simply no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin; heads will never be tails. But it's like the same thing, and there are a lot of civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing, where your primary or next of kin can't even be in the room with you if you're sick. It's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone and lots of scientific studies have been done, and homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. I don't understand where people, like Catholics, get hung up on saying it's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing. But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yes, they are the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation, or not. But again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption, because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean they're going to have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But I think President Bush has very strong views of his own to do with his religion. Well, his take on gay marriage actually goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research, which I think most of the reasons I've heard at least in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the culture and morality of all the rest is hypocritical of the government, considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay-marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "At the beginning I was okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks and I think we went into Iraq as a pretext - there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and claimed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general the Iraq war still boils my blood. \n\nUm, It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been very openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since 9/11, at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. Um, That last part I forget the name of the Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. Um, But it seems to me that the younger Bush had a kind of bloodlust against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. Well, I do think it's gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. Um, I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order, but I don't necessarily know that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the parliament is very effective at all, that um, Oh I don't remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government, and I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.

            "I don't feel comfortable with this\nIt's not right, that it's legalized or declared legal by a state\nI think it's really up to the churches, because in the constitution it says there's a step between church and state\nIt's clear\nIt's clear\nUh\nIt's\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it \nTrying to exert any kind of power over it \nWould be in defiance of what has already been said and written\nSo \nUh\nAs for the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really a stance of one church against another\nBecause we can see that most Catholics \nUh\nCatholics and Christians are really against it\nAnd don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um\nI don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd although they planned on making an amendment\nI think even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contrary to what's already been said and written\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don't feel that's right\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion\nSo I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don't know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society \nThan it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Okay\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other\nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nUm \nI \nI myself am against war and \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is in many ways \nA \nA repeat of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with\n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing was that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into the war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and the Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard cause once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to its finish but them again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil factor\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let’s see, I’m for gay marriage, I've always been. I think it's a personal preference and what has been proven more and more now is that it could be biological, rather than sociological, so people shouldn't be given less rights just because it's not their control. I think it's inhumane to give them less rights. And I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think there should be any influence from the state and government in this, it's a personal matter, a household matter. You know, in my neighborhood at home there are, I think, two or three openly gay couples who aren't, you know, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way as any other family would. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that with Bush trying to play God and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, it's kind of ridiculous.\n\nYes, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from various different publications and TV reports or newspapers, that it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain; it's something they might be predisposed to be homosexual. Instead of growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know you don't have a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side, opposed to the sociological.\n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that marriage is something that, if a man and a woman want to do it, they can just go to Vegas and do it without telling a single person, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to be on the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's something that should be a personal, private matter, rather than public domain and national, federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum. It's completely public. You can't. I mean, as an R.A., it's something I've actually had to deal with already. When you put something out there, it's going to color people's opinions of you. And if you're talking about blowing things up or if you're talking about shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there, put it to the world. The internet is seen by everybody. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin. Obviously it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school and they have to act on that. They can't just let it sit because then, God forbid, something happens, they could have prevented it. [Right] But you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. Sorry, couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think. What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through a friend of his Facebook and got very worried because there were certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friend-ing their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking. And going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs and if it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Um. Yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Um. Not really.",

I hate joining the bandwagon of people who are like, \"I was against it from the beginning.\" I was against it, but it's not that important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit that they were wrong. And you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now, think it was a stupid idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration, or previous administrations, to understand. They think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's disputing that. But you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand from when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And these are the people that we're trying to save, that we're trying to help. They're telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then we know it's not on us if something happens. If it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in, but you guys made the decision not to, and then we'll at least... I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys. Kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But you know, it'll be better than where we are, where we stand right now.",
            "I feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. Um, and it's not just with women, but also with men. I think it has to do with the specific field of work you're dealing with. Um, I mean, overall, I think women have it harder because there's the glass ceiling where, even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time recognizing that they can work under a woman if they're a man. It's due to how society has been raised for so long. And often in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. And um, I think the same thing goes for men, and like in other industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really uncommon for a man to be the one staying at home. Um, a lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh, you're a man, you should be working, you should be the breadwinner of your family, why are you staying at home? And it can be really hard on them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe their wife has a better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that. And in the fashion industry, um, a lot of times people won't take straight men seriously. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I think it's because typically men who are into fashion, um, like they have different lifestyles, and so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women, if you're not really, like, in that case? And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Um, to change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and obviously, we've made great strides since the 1800s, in many areas, but the change is very slow, and I think that if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more, and just like men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh, maybe the woman has a better job or she wants to be the one working, and um, then for people in fashion, they'll be like, oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives and so they know where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them, because if you force it, people will resist, and I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, it's like people will resist, and we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time. Yes, um, well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you may not have the best grammar in the world, and or even though you may be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, well, how do I really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right, so yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example, um, not really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it. They decriminalized it, which means they no longer considered it a crime. It got knocked down from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket; you know, something you get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean, usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about, are the future ramifications, and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time, there’s an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. When you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of on the open-minded track, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on food programs for homeless people. I mean, so I think it’s important because marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and about everywhere. I mean, there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized, not just financial. Other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized. Well no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well, if it were totally legal, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be smoking and driving. And it’s still like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana. So, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. I mean, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think marijuana has a more negative impact on a lot of people’s lives, as opposed to just their decision making and motor skills. I mean, but they both have their negative effects, and I mean, when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. So, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own negative effects. Um, yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes. Because many of the things they do are very traditional like they've been doing the same things for a long time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe you have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was Episcopalian, no my dad was Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm it might but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. People who molest children would probably do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",
            "I don't know \nI haven't really made a decision on this matter \nSo \nI can't say if either side is right or wrong \nBut \nI believe that this is the most difficult point we're facing today \nBecause \nSomething that's so close to the separation of church and state \nAnd \nHow to define marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending someone \nSo \nI don't know, I think \nI think that all civil unions \nI don't know if marriage should be seen that way \nAnd \nLike \nDefined by the government \nSince it's considered a sacrament \nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr \nBe looked at in a specific way by the government if they were baptized \nAnd \nSo \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause \nThat's what it is \nIt's two people \nThere shouldn't be a separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was \nTwo people got together \nSo \nAnd \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat's just \nOh two people who entered a civil union \n\nUm \nWell if all the states come to a logical conclusion, they should try to make it federal law \nBut \nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is simply ridiculous \nIt is \nSomething that the constitution shouldn't be changed for \nI mean it's a very big issue for some people \nBut \nIt's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment \n\nIt's just not important enough to change the constitution \nTo ban \nTo ban gay marriage \nSimply put \n\nUh \nNo",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like \nHomosexuality is kind of a gray area for me \nBecause \nI have a lot of gay friends \nUm \nI think that I don't necessarily agree with this lifestyle \nBut \nI think it should be legalized \nI don't think it should be a national issue \nHowever I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than \nUm \nLike \nThe president deciding for the entire country \n\nUm \nWell, like many states are democratic \nAnd \nMany states are Republican \nObviously democratic states are going to push for gay marriage \nAnd \nUm \nIf you're living in a democratic state \nLike obviously you know how that state feels about that position \nAnd \nUm \nI don't think you're necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage \nBecause \nLike \nYou kind of chose to live there \nYou know \nSo I \nLike \nI think \nI don't \nI think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals so \nI feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state \n\nWell I kind of already answered that \nBut \n\nUm \nYeah I don't feel as though \nUm \nBush should be allowed to \nUm \nDecide \nUm \nUm \nThat the whole country should be against gay marriage \nI think that it should be up to the \nUm \nIndividual states as to whether they want to legalize it \nI don't agree with his ban on it \n\nUm \nI just \nI just don't think \nLike \nI don't think that \nLike Bush doesn't live in every single state \nSo \nHe shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to govern \nUm \nItself I guess I don't know \nUm \nSo \nI think that \nUm \nSome things should be left up to \nUm \nEach individual state \nPlus he's going to be out of office in like two years \nAnd \nIf a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage \nLike \nIt's just going to go back and forth \nIt should just be up to each individual state \nBecause \nThey're the ones that are going to have to live with that decision \nNot the president \n\nNo I don't",
            "No, I don't think so at all, I mean. Let's see how I see it. In my opinion, Myspace is a public thing, and a bulletin. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know that's just enough reason to post for the public to see or for others to see. Whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you know you have to realize that people will see that, whether it be school officials or not. So, in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it. Because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But, uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Let me see here. Like, you know, if they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble. And I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. But I feel as though, you know, as long as they save lives, or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that?\n\nYeah, I mean, okay. Well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. But\n\nOkay, well, I mean, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. I mean, everything, like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid someone will pick that up and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, I guess you could say.\n\nLike, you know, if you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll like find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble. And I don't think it's not an invasion of privacy because, you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying, it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here.\n\nI mean, like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them or other officials, such as the police, to go on. You know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they said, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff and, uh, that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, because, uh, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess. So we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school safer, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Yeah, that's basically all I can come up with.\n\nUh, no, that's about it.",
            "Okay, I initially thought it was the right thing to do because I was personally affected by September 11. Um, I was for going over there and causing as much chaos as they had caused over here. Um, I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. And we kind of just went over there unprepared, without a plan. Um, I think it backfired on us. Um, I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it, I don't think it achieved anything. Um, I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like I don't think our being over there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. So um, like unfortunately because of September 11, I've almost lost interest in what's going on over there. Um, with those people, I just don't care, I just think, I don't think they're human sometimes. I don't know, they just can't stop fighting with each other and can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care, um, I don't know, we definitely went over there unprepared, we didn't know what we were going to face over there. Um, and it's also bad because war for them is totally different than war for us, they're just like savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're interested in improving their country, I just think they're interested in getting us out of there. And I think that would be fine for us, I think we should just leave and that's it. Um, we just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything, I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay, let's rebuild and that's it. So um, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do, I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order, and I don't know, I just think they didn't, there was no unity, they didn't know what they were going into, so I think that would have helped us a lot more, but like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say, it's gone on for long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress, like we've made progress but not enough to stay there, and I think no matter how long we stay there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse, and we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Their views are quite outdated in some aspects, and I think the Church is losing followers because it's not very accepting of many things. Within the cases of gay marriages, abortion, and birth control, the Church has strong views, which is fine, but they seem old-fashioned to me. I think if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because of their views on these situations and because people disagree with them on certain subjects. Therefore, I think the Church has the wrong view on things. I mean, the Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a community where it's taught to be completely wrong and you're against it. The same goes for gay marriage, where if you believe in it and want to do it or feel strongly about it, you might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with it. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or have female priests, but I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. Maybe they wouldn't have done it if they were allowed to be married or have women priests, but I don't know if that would have necessarily changed things. I mean, that was something they did, and it didn't seem to be affected. If they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to tell. I don't see why priests can't be married. The Church says that priests are married to God, but everyone else in the world has a job and a family life. I don't see why priests can't have both. No.",
            "I personally think it's okay for gay couples to get married. I believe it's not just a matter of choice, but also a part of biology. I don't think it's a conscious decision. Gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about the topic, but I'd definitely say it's wrong to say that. It seems it's not really a choice; they don't really have a choice in who they are. Like, I was born straight, and I guess another person is born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held responsible for. I'd definitely think it's wrong to say they made a wrong decision. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not something affecting our country's security or moral issues. It just seems like they're out of place. They don't seem to have the right to intervene in people's lives. That's just who they are - gay people, that's how they were born, at least that's what I think. And they shouldn't be punished for that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security concern or a moral issue; it's just not their place. It's hard. I think the federal government shouldn't be involved because it has nothing to do with our country's security or moral issues. They're just out of place, and it doesn't seem like they have the right to intervene in people's lives.

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's simply no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin; heads will never be tails. But it's like the same thing, and there are a lot of civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing, where your primary or next of kin can't even be in the room with you if you're sick. It's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone and lots of scientific studies have been done, and homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. I don't understand where people, like Catholics, get hung up on saying it's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing. But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yes, they are the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation, or not. But again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption, because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean they're going to have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But I think President Bush has very strong views of his own to do with his religion. Well, his take on gay marriage actually goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research, which I think most of the reasons I've heard at least in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the culture and morality of all the rest is hypocritical of the government, considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay-marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "At the beginning I was okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks and I think we went into Iraq as a pretext - there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and claimed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general the Iraq war still boils my blood. \n\nUm, It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been very openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since 9/11, at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. Um, That last part I forget the name of the Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. Um, But it seems to me that the younger Bush had a kind of bloodlust against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. Well, I do think it's gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. Um, I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order, but I don't necessarily know that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the parliament is very effective at all, that um, Oh I don't remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government, and I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. Um, (laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I was thinking \nMmhmm \nShould I just talk about it? \nOk \nOk, that would be cool \nUh huh \nUh \nSorry, I'm done \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me think \nBut at this point, I feel like it's pointless because it's not even a declared war actually \nI mean, it was just a revenge thing against Iraq because we thought they carried out the 9/11 attacks \nSo I feel like \nI mean, I'm not a big fan of the War in Iraq \nI don't keep up with it \nI don't know the details \nBut at this point, I know that we're staying over there to try and build a democratic system so that it can feel like another U.S. place \nAnd also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut there's no reason for us to stay over there because it's making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd if we stay over there then what's going to end up happening is we have to try and build a democratic system which is going to take forever because a democratic system can't be built in just a day \nAnd then if we leave they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me think \nOh, this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I know the least about \nUm \nIraq War \nOh, this is hard \nUh \nMmm \nI don't know \nDo you have anything I can go by? \nOk \nThanks \nUm \nWell, actually I think \nI think the war should continue because it's not fair \nI don't think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I think \nYou know \nI think the only reason we use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn't even declare it \nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it was never declared by Congress \nI think that's how it works \nYou have to declare a war with Congress \nAnd then it's \nI just don't think it's a big point to still stay over there and try \nActually not \nI do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them \nBut it's also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like \nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of what it's doing and it's like \nAnd what it's doing to \nRemember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nThe Vietnam War was an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war \nAnd he's like saying \nHe'll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nYou have to make this in 30 minutes, don't you? \nUh \nOk, yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt's like \nIt's hard to say \nI want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it's going to be even worse for them \nAnd it's going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them \nAnd they've been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it's going to \nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat's it \nOk",
            "I don't feel comfortable with this\nIt's not right, that it's legalized or declared legal by a state\nI think it's really up to the churches, because in the constitution it says there's a step between church and state\nIt's clear\nIt's clear\nUh\nIt's\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it \nTrying to exert any kind of power over it \nWould be in defiance of what has already been said and written\nSo \nUh\nAs for the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really a stance of one church against another\nBecause we can see that most Catholics \nUh\nCatholics and Christians are really against it\nAnd don't support it, except in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um\nI don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd although they planned on making an amendment\nI think even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contrary to what's already been said and written\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don't feel that's right\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion\nSo I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don't know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society \nThan it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Okay\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other\nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nUm \nI \nI myself am against war and \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is in many ways \nA \nA repeat of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with\n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that's horrible \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing was that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don't think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into the war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and the Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard cause once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to its finish but them again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil factor\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let’s see, I’m for gay marriage, I've always been. I think it's a personal preference and what has been proven more and more now is that it could be biological, rather than sociological, so people shouldn't be given less rights just because it's not their control. I think it's inhumane to give them less rights. And I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think there should be any influence from the state and government in this, it's a personal matter, a household matter. You know, in my neighborhood at home there are, I think, two or three openly gay couples who aren't, you know, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way as any other family would. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that with Bush trying to play God and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, it's kind of ridiculous.\n\nYes, sure, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from various different publications and TV reports or newspapers, that it's something now that's a chemical thing in the brain; it's something they might be predisposed to be homosexual. Instead of growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother and you know you don't have a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side, opposed to the sociological.\n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that marriage is something that, if a man and a woman want to do it, they can just go to Vegas and do it without telling a single person, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to be on the front page of the New York Times, you know. I think it's something that should be a personal, private matter, rather than public domain and national, federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum. It's completely public. You can't. I mean, as an R.A., it's something I've actually had to deal with already. When you put something out there, it's going to color people's opinions of you. And if you're talking about blowing things up or if you're talking about shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there, put it to the world. The internet is seen by everybody. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin. Obviously it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school and they have to act on that. They can't just let it sit because then, God forbid, something happens, they could have prevented it. [Right] But you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. Sorry, couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think. What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through a friend of his Facebook and got very worried because there were certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friend-ing their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking. And going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs and if it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Um. Yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Um. Not really.",

I hate joining the bandwagon of people who are like, \"I was against it from the beginning.\" I was against it, but it's not that important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit that they were wrong. And you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now, think it was a stupid idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration, or previous administrations, to understand. They think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's disputing that. But you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand from when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And these are the people that we're trying to save, that we're trying to help. They're telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then we know it's not on us if something happens. If it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in, but you guys made the decision not to, and then we'll at least... I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys. Kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But you know, it'll be better than where we are, where we stand right now.",
            "I feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. Um, and it's not just with women, but also with men. I think it has to do with the specific field of work you're dealing with. Um, I mean, overall, I think women have it harder because there's the glass ceiling where, even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time recognizing that they can work under a woman if they're a man. It's due to how society has been raised for so long. And often in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. And um, I think the same thing goes for men, and like in other industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really uncommon for a man to be the one staying at home. Um, a lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh, you're a man, you should be working, you should be the breadwinner of your family, why are you staying at home? And it can be really hard on them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe their wife has a better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that. And in the fashion industry, um, a lot of times people won't take straight men seriously. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I think it's because typically men who are into fashion, um, like they have different lifestyles, and so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women, if you're not really, like, in that case? And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Um, to change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and obviously, we've made great strides since the 1800s, in many areas, but the change is very slow, and I think that if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more, and just like men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh, maybe the woman has a better job or she wants to be the one working, and um, then for people in fashion, they'll be like, oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives and so they know where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them, because if you force it, people will resist, and I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, it's like people will resist, and we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time. Yes, um, well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you may not have the best grammar in the world, and or even though you may be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, well, how do I really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right, so yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example, um, not really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it. They decriminalized it, which means they no longer considered it a crime. It got knocked down from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket; you know, something you get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean, usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about, are the future ramifications, and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time, there’s an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. When you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of on the open-minded track, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on food programs for homeless people. I mean, so I think it’s important because marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and about everywhere. I mean, there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized, not just financial. Other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized. Well no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well, if it were totally legal, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be smoking and driving. And it’s still like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana. So, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. I mean, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think marijuana has a more negative impact on a lot of people’s lives, as opposed to just their decision making and motor skills. I mean, but they both have their negative effects, and I mean, when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. So, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own negative effects. Um, yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes. Because many of the things they do are very traditional like they've been doing the same things for a long time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe you have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was Episcopalian, no my dad was Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm it might but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. People who molest children would probably do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",
            "I don't know \nI haven't really made a decision on this matter \nSo \nI can't say if either side is right or wrong \nBut \nI believe that this is the most difficult point we're facing today \nBecause \nSomething that's so close to the separation of church and state \nAnd \nHow to define marriage is something that's very difficult to do without offending someone \nSo \nI don't know, I think \nI think that all civil unions \nI don't know if marriage should be seen that way \nAnd \nLike \nDefined by the government \nSince it's considered a sacrament \nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks \nOr \nBe looked at in a specific way by the government if they were baptized \nAnd \nSo \nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union \nBecause \nThat's what it is \nIt's two people \nThere shouldn't be a separation of church and state \nThey shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was \nTwo people got together \nSo \nAnd \nThe fact that gay marriage \nI mean \nThat's just \nOh two people who entered a civil union \n\nUm \nWell if all the states come to a logical conclusion, they should try to make it federal law \nBut \nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is simply ridiculous \nIt is \nSomething that the constitution shouldn't be changed for \nI mean it's a very big issue for some people \nBut \nIt's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment \n\nIt's just not important enough to change the constitution \nTo ban \nTo ban gay marriage \nSimply put \n\nUh \nNo",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like \nHomosexuality is kind of a gray area for me \nBecause \nI have a lot of gay friends \nUm \nI think that I don't necessarily agree with this lifestyle \nBut \nI think it should be legalized \nI don't think it should be a national issue \nHowever I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than \nUm \nLike \nThe president deciding for the entire country \n\nUm \nWell, like many states are democratic \nAnd \nMany states are Republican \nObviously democratic states are going to push for gay marriage \nAnd \nUm \nIf you're living in a democratic state \nLike obviously you know how that state feels about that position \nAnd \nUm \nI don't think you're necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage \nBecause \nLike \nYou kind of chose to live there \nYou know \nSo I \nLike \nI think \nI don't \nI think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals so \nI feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state \n\nWell I kind of already answered that \nBut \n\nUm \nYeah I don't feel as though \nUm \nBush should be allowed to \nUm \nDecide \nUm \nUm \nThat the whole country should be against gay marriage \nI think that it should be up to the \nUm \nIndividual states as to whether they want to legalize it \nI don't agree with his ban on it \n\nUm \nI just \nI just don't think \nLike \nI don't think that \nLike Bush doesn't live in every single state \nSo \nHe shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to govern \nUm \nItself I guess I don't know \nUm \nSo \nI think that \nUm \nSome things should be left up to \nUm \nEach individual state \nPlus he's going to be out of office in like two years \nAnd \nIf a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage \nLike \nIt's just going to go back and forth \nIt should just be up to each individual state \nBecause \nThey're the ones that are going to have to live with that decision \nNot the president \n\nNo I don't",
            "No, I don't think so at all, I mean. Let's see how I see it. In my opinion, Myspace is a public thing, and a bulletin. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know that's just enough reason to post for the public to see or for others to see. Whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you know you have to realize that people will see that, whether it be school officials or not. So, in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it. Because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But, uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Let me see here. Like, you know, if they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble. And I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. But I feel as though, you know, as long as they save lives, or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that?\n\nYeah, I mean, okay. Well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. But\n\nOkay, well, I mean, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. I mean, everything, like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid someone will pick that up and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, I guess you could say.\n\nLike, you know, if you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll like find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble. And I don't think it's not an invasion of privacy because, you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying, it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here.\n\nI mean, like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them or other officials, such as the police, to go on. You know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they said, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff and, uh, that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, because, uh, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess. So we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school safer, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Yeah, that's basically all I can come up with.\n\nUh, no, that's about it.",
            "Okay, I initially thought it was the right thing to do because I was personally affected by September 11. Um, I was for going over there and causing as much chaos as they had caused over here. Um, I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. And we kind of just went over there unprepared, without a plan. Um, I think it backfired on us. Um, I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it, I don't think it achieved anything. Um, I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like I don't think our being over there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. So um, like unfortunately because of September 11, I've almost lost interest in what's going on over there. Um, with those people, I just don't care, I just think, I don't think they're human sometimes. I don't know, they just can't stop fighting with each other and can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care, um, I don't know, we definitely went over there unprepared, we didn't know what we were going to face over there. Um, and it's also bad because war for them is totally different than war for us, they're just like savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're interested in improving their country, I just think they're interested in getting us out of there. And I think that would be fine for us, I think we should just leave and that's it. Um, we just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything, I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay, let's rebuild and that's it. So um, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do, I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order, and I don't know, I just think they didn't, there was no unity, they didn't know what they were going into, so I think that would have helped us a lot more, but like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say, it's gone on for long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress, like we've made progress but not enough to stay there, and I think no matter how long we stay there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse, and we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay."
