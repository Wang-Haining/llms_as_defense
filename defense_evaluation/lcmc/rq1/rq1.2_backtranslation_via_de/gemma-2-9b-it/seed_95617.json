            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change their views. I think that a lot of people are talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its following, and I think it's because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things. Like, for example, gay marriages, abortion, birth control. Things like that. The Catholic Church has very strong views on them, which is fine, but their views are a little bit old-fashioned in some ways. So I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their following. \n\nWell, I've heard that people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of the way they see these situations. People are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects. So I feel that they feel the Catholic Church kind of has the wrong view on things. \n\nI mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion. So if you were for abortion, you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong and you were going against it.\n\nWell, I mean the same I guess with gay marriage and things like that where if that was something that you believed in and that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about, you might not want to be in a following where they didn't agree with that.\n\nI don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or that priests can't be married. But I don't know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened. I mean I don't know, eh? I don't know if they might not have just done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don't know if that would have necessarily changed it.\n\nWell, I mean that was something they did, and that was something that, I don't know, that was something they did, and it might not have really seemed to be affected. I mean, if they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to really tell.\n\nYeah, um, well I don't see why there priests can't be married. I mean, the Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God and they're devoted their complete life. But I don't see everyone else who has a job in the world has their job, then they also have their family life, and the other people they are devoted to, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "Um, well, I'm not against same-sex marriage. I think, regardless of whether you're born that way or whatever, I don't think it's a conscious decision. So I think that people, you know, gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation or whatever. Um, so I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't really. (Pause) I haven't really thought about the topic that much, but, uhm, yeah, I would definitely say it's wrong to say that.\n\nUm, so it seems that it's not really a choice. So, they don't really have a choice about how they are. Like, uhm, I mean, I was born straight, and you know, another person is born gay, I guess. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for if you know what I mean.\n\n(Pause, clears throat) Ah yeah, I would definitely think it's wrong to do that. I don't really think the federal government should be involved because it's more of, uhm, I don't think it's a legal issue. I, I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue. Um, I mean again, like I don't think these, uhm, gay people should be, um, how do I say, ah, um, should be put, like I mean, like, on a stage like they're, you know, like it's wrong, like, like, that they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever.\n\nSo I don't think the federal government really has any say. \n\nUm, it's hard.\n\n(laughs)\n\nUm, ok, well, um, I don't think the federal government should be involved because it is, I mean, it's nothing involving the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that, it's not like, it just seems like they're out of place, it doesn't seem like they have any right to, to interject in people's lives, and, and you know, that's just who they are, the, who, who, uhm, you know, gay people, that's just like how they were born or at least that's what I think, and I mean, it's, they shouldn't be punished for that.\n\nUh no, that's it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's not a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. There are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. And there are a bunch of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin, I don't want to say next of kin because I'm not sure that that's what it is, but if you're in a gay couple then your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's kind of a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success; they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just, it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's not involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation: separate but unequal. Yeah, they are; they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community and especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's um, sexual orientation choices or not, but well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is um, how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society like in New York City I know they um, they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get like beaten up, and stuff like that parents protest to get the child removed from their school and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples and so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to; I mean it's just about personality choices. \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion, well his um, his take on gay marriage actually um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which um, I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but the most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about um, under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country um, just one lots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect and that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.",

            "Um, I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century.\nIt's not as strict as it used to be.\nI know, even as I've gotten older, when I was younger, I always went to church every Sunday.\nAnd I would always get cute little dresses.\nAnd matching shoes.\nAnd a matching purse.\nAnd that was just every single Sunday.\nI went to a private school.\nAnd I would see all my friends there on the weekends.\nAnd we would just go.\nBut now, as I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass.\nAnd they cut it down to thirty minutes.\nAnd people dress a lot more casual.\nEspecially during summer people would come in their beach clothes, like straight from the beach.\nYou'd have the families there that are just running in late.\nSo I think it has become more casual.\nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up, people are wearing jeans and khakis.\nWell khakis are nice too.\nBut just a lot more casual in respect to that.\nAs for other things, that's the biggest thing that I noticed.\nLike that's the church I know.\nI don't know the politics into the church and what not.\nBut yeah, that's it.\n\n[OK, um regarding all of the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm, I don't think that these things could have been avoided.\nBecause there are men who are married and they still become pedophiles.\nAnd they still have uh an attraction towards young kids.\nSo I think even if you got them married it's just the person, it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married.\nUm, I think also when they're becoming a priest it's their choice to become a priest.\nUm, there are religions that they're allowed to get married where they could be like on Seventh Heaven, I don't know what kind of title he has.\nHe's a reverend or a minister or something.\n[Mm hmm]\nBut they're allowed to get married.\nSo I know it's a little different.\nBut if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith.\n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm, on which part?\nAbout [Um]\nJust the changing ways [That it really wouldn't make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia.\n[Mm hmm]\nUm, I think, like the whole thing about sexuality, before about being genetics.\nI think it's based on genetics.\nI don't think people um just become it.\nI think they're born that way.\nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up.\nIt might have something to do a little more in this case, but I think it's their genetics.\nAnd you can't hide that through a marriage.\nYou could try, but then it would usually come out.\nSo I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening.\nUm, if they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them.\nBut I don't think in all cases they knew.\n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUm no.",
            "(laughs)\nInitially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext - there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that's very much rubbed me the wrong way, and in general the Iraq war just boils my blood.\n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact.\nEven Colin Powell.\nI mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nAnd\nTo me that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well, since September 11th at least. I mean,\nI think that they\nUm\nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm \nThat last part\n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell\nI do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like\nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because\nUm\nIraq's sovereignty will come to be an issue.\nA major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all.\nThat um \nOh I can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what's happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting\nI guess it was less than a year ago.\nHis party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm \n(laughs)\nNone that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I did\nMmhmm\nJust talk into it?\nOk\nOk cool\nUh huh\nUh\nOk, I'm sorry\nOk\nHow I feel about the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point I feel it's kind of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S.\nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven\nSo I don't feel like\nI mean I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq\nSo I don't like keep up with it\nI don't know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them\nBut it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day\nAnd then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me see\nOhh this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don't know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh this hard\nUh\nMmm\nUhh I don't know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOk\nThank you\nUm\nWell um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair\nI don't think we should call it a war anymore\nBut because I don't think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn't even call it\nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it never was declared a war by congress\nI think that's how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it's\nI just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them\nBut it's also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like\nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it's doing and it's like\nAnd what it's doing to like\nCause remember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he's like saying\nHe'll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don't you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt's like\nIt's hard to say\nI want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it's going to be even worse for them\nAnd it's going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them\nAnd they've been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it's gonna\nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat's about it\nOk",
            "I agree with you. I don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to allow it to be legal. I think it really lies with the churches, because the constitution even says separation of church and state. \n\nIt's clear, clearly stated, and I feel that if we try to do anything with it, exert any kind of power over it, it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone in the constitution.  So, as for the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another because, as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it, except for up in Boston and some of those areas. But I don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal and legal.\n\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much, uh, like a key aspect of the constitution and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they planned on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just contradictory to what's already been said and written there. Plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't feel that's right at all in that aspect.\n\nNo, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic and, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular, and there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else. If anything, it could possibly boost it, I think by, I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\n\n\n Umm, not quite. I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay, here's the English translation:\n\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, to start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq, and I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, one really didn't have that much to do with the other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\nUm\nI\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially to make a preemptive strike. I was against that.\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with...\nI mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died. \nAnd that's horrible and what they were doing was that they were taking out, they were removing the countries government, and I really don't think the government, the American government was prepared for the... what for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\nUm\nAnd here, and the government, and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government, and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam, they were trying to push out Communists, and and to uphold or implement, implement and uphold democracy, and and it is, and it is, and the government, and the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't, that was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't, like it wasn't a clear. \nI mean it was more of a, it was more of a loss in Vietnam because because, because there because there are there are. No matter how many people may have supported, no matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents, and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting an actual army. \nYou're fighting the citizens, the specific citizens in the country and so so I think, I think that the government, so first of all, I think that we shouldn't have gotten into into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and but if you are going to go to war with a country you need to be, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been. I mean worst and either for what would really not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and I mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still, um many American troops are still dying and and there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi and the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that that the US government in a way tried to well they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a a a short successful stay in Iraq and I mean we shouldn't we're kinda we're naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful. I mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was lots of tension and there was civil war and um it's just not an easy thing to do, and I think the government the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do and um so so let's see the war in Iraq well that's, no that's a difficult decision to make because that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of um one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and and so I mean once it's really hard cause once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people I mean we're the ones that took away their government and and their way of life so how can we abandon them now so so its probably something that we should (coughs) excuse me try to see to its finish but them again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and and and how and how much is is too much to to to keep risking for for a free democratic Iraq I mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we're if we're if we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is is the is the oil issue and this is where we are getting our oil from and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found and yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them so I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions. \nLet’s see um I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not.",

            "I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. I think the purpose was good at the beginning, meaning to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose, and we're now maybe just doing it for the sake of doing it, just to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I just think also maybe the motives were originally questionable, considering George Bush's father's previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein. So I think, um, I think the original motivation, if it was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation. If there were any personal matters in it, I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. Um, I think we got our purpose across in the first couple of months, just starting the war. I think that was a statement in itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too drawn out.\n\nUm, yeah, I think, um, I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country that was ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose, and that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think, I think our reason over time has been deteriorated and misconceived, just like it seems that we're still at war for the purpose of going to war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive end, a victory or something.\n\nUm, yeah, I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway, and I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars, when we have our own wars on our own turf, such as poverty and whatnot, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out.\n\nYeah, I mean they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements, you know, um, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify that? Um, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... O okay. Um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if... I mean if you post information on the internet it's... It's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone's profile. You might need to... You know, be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So... I mean, whenever you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost... Hum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, O let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything. Um, I mean I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for... You know some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um like, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know that there's creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this um, this man who just... he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily. And he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that. But I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me and it's hard because you think that they know your interests they know what you look like sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day who your friends are they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean you never know really who can look at what so. Hum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her um high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn't sure how how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that.

            "Yes, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States.\nAnd not only with women, I think it also has to do with the particular field of work that you're dealing with.\nI mean, overall, I think women have it harder because there's the glass ceiling, and even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time finding that they could have to work under a woman if they're a man, just because of how society has been raised for so long.\nAnd often women will see at the workplace a job that they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it.\nBut maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper hands of the business world.\nAnd um, I guess the same thing goes for men.\nAnd in other industries like fashion or\nUm\nBeing a parent at home is really uncommon.\nIt's ähm\nNot typical to have a male parent staying at home.\nAnd um\nOften people look down upon that because society thinks, oh well, you're the male, you should be out working.\nYou should be the money maker of your family.\nWhy are you staying at home?\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job.\nAnd like it's working out fine for them.\nBut society looks down upon that.\nAnd then in the fashion industry\nUm\nPeople won't really take males seriously if they're straight.\nI don't know if that really makes sense.\nBut I guess it's because typically males who are into fashion\nUm\nLike, I guess have different styles of life.\nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, wait, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for a woman?\nLike, you don't really don't know what our case is like.\nLike, these other guys.\"\nSo\nDepending on, like, what field of work you're in,\nI feel like there definitely is gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because the society like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds.\nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO's and they're getting more accepted in the business world and it's a slow process.\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more.\nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads,\nIt's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works.\nAnd um\nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff.\nAnd so they do know like where I'm coming from.\nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy.\nBut um saying like the qualities of them.\nBecause if you force it people are going to resist.\nAnd I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that.\nSo I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist.\nAnd we've come a long ways and change takes time.\nYes\nUm\nWell I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from.\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job.\nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and\nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right.\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you.\nAnd like from gender to gender.\nAnd I don't know\nI guess that'd be another example.\nUm\nNot really.",
            "Well, my understanding is that they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it. Um, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to uh, a to more of like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. Um, and I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, um, those types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would, I mean, usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge. One thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and to house them and then to let them go. And then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times and then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of uh, kind of thought track, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it’s, it’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff. Um, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there’s this whole like financial element to it as well. Other reasons like? Why it shouldn’t necessarily, well no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere and then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving and um, it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don’t really know, um, I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um yeah, uh, no I don’t.",
            "I would say yes because a lot of the things they do are very traditional, like they've done the same things for long periods of time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. And sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. And they also don't accept people of other religions. Like for example, my dad was an Episcopalian. No, I'm sorry, my father was an Episcopalian, my mother was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to, you know, love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nUm, I don't think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior. So because it's just a different realm, um, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nUm, well, I guess, like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a, a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse. So if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent, um, those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless.\n\nNope.",
            "Um, I haven't really made up my mind on this matter yet. So I can't say if either side is right or wrong, but I believe this is the trickiest topic we're facing today because something so close to the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone. So, I don't know, I think that all civil unions, I don't know whether marriage should be looked at and defined by the government, seeing as it is a sacrament like considered, well, people wouldn't get tax breaks or looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized, and so, if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is, it's two people. They shouldn't have a separation of church and state, they shouldn't look into like, well, what kind of marriage was it? Two people got united. So, and the fact that gay marriage, I mean, that would just, oh, two people you got a civil union. Um, well, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It is something like the constitution shouldn't just be amended for something, I mean it is a very big cause for certain people, but it's not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define to ban gay marriage. Simply put, uh, no.",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends. I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, but I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. I feel, though, that it should be something that each state decides on its own rather than, say, the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nWell, a lot of states are democratic and a lot are republican. Obviously, democratic states are going to push for gay marriage. And if you're living in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. And I don't think you're really in a place to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage because you kind of chose to live there, you know? So I think, homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already answered that, but...\n\nYeah, I don't think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don't think, like, Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to run itself, I guess. I don't know. So I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's going to be out of office in like two years and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, like it's just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they're the ones that are going to have to live with that decision, not the president.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change their views. I think that a lot of people are talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its following, and I think it's because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things. Like, for example, gay marriages, abortion, birth control. Things like that. The Catholic Church has very strong views on them, which is fine, but their views are a little bit old-fashioned in some ways. So I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their following. \n\nWell, I've heard that people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of the way they see these situations. People are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects. So I feel that they feel the Catholic Church kind of has the wrong view on things. \n\nI mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion. So if you were for abortion, you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong and you were going against it.\n\nWell, I mean the same I guess with gay marriage and things like that where if that was something that you believed in and that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about, you might not want to be in a following where they didn't agree with that.\n\nI don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or that priests can't be married. But I don't know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened. I mean I don't know, eh? I don't know if they might not have just done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don't know if that would have necessarily changed it.\n\nWell, I mean that was something they did, and that was something that, I don't know, that was something they did, and it might not have really seemed to be affected. I mean, if they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to really tell.\n\nYeah, um, well I don't see why there priests can't be married. I mean, the Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God and they're devoted their complete life. But I don't see everyone else who has a job in the world has their job, then they also have their family life, and the other people they are devoted to, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "Um, well, I'm not against same-sex marriage. I think, regardless of whether you're born that way or whatever, I don't think it's a conscious decision. So I think that people, you know, gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation or whatever. Um, so I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't really. (Pause) I haven't really thought about the topic that much, but, uhm, yeah, I would definitely say it's wrong to say that.\n\nUm, so it seems that it's not really a choice. So, they don't really have a choice about how they are. Like, uhm, I mean, I was born straight, and you know, another person is born gay, I guess. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for if you know what I mean.\n\n(Pause, clears throat) Ah yeah, I would definitely think it's wrong to do that. I don't really think the federal government should be involved because it's more of, uhm, I don't think it's a legal issue. I, I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue. Um, I mean again, like I don't think these, uhm, gay people should be, um, how do I say, ah, um, should be put, like I mean, like, on a stage like they're, you know, like it's wrong, like, like, that they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever.\n\nSo I don't think the federal government really has any say. \n\nUm, it's hard.\n\n(laughs)\n\nUm, ok, well, um, I don't think the federal government should be involved because it is, I mean, it's nothing involving the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that, it's not like, it just seems like they're out of place, it doesn't seem like they have any right to, to interject in people's lives, and, and you know, that's just who they are, the, who, who, uhm, you know, gay people, that's just like how they were born or at least that's what I think, and I mean, it's, they shouldn't be punished for that.\n\nUh no, that's it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's not a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. There are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. And there are a bunch of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin, I don't want to say next of kin because I'm not sure that that's what it is, but if you're in a gay couple then your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's kind of a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success; they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just, it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's not involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation: separate but unequal. Yeah, they are; they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community and especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's um, sexual orientation choices or not, but well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is um, how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society like in New York City I know they um, they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get like beaten up, and stuff like that parents protest to get the child removed from their school and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples and so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to; I mean it's just about personality choices. \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion, well his um, his take on gay marriage actually um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which um, I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but the most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about um, under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country um, just one lots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect and that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.",
            "Well, first off, I work at the hospital pharmacy over the summer.\nYou know, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has positive properties.\nSo, I mean, as far as having it available for the public, I'd say no, absolutely not.\nBut, if it's used for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes, because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial, it's not beneficial, you know what I mean?\n\nYeah, so, I mean there are a lot of illegal drugs that pharmacies use,\nlike oxycodone,\nVicodin,\nPercocet,\nthat kind of thing.\nAnd those are controlled substances,\nbut we use them all the time because they're beneficial, and if you deny those benefits\njust because there's a taboo around marijuana then,\nI mean, there's no point in doing that for me.\nYou should embrace its positive properties, I think.\n\nWell, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana,\nalthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things.\nWell, it's a tough one.\nI'd say,\nnot,\nyou could integrate it,\nlike let it become legal gradually but not all at once,\nbecause then it would be abused, but if you just,\nyou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first,\nand then people might use it responsibly.\n\nUm, yeah,\npeople have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug.\nBut, I mean it's not that bad for you.\nIt's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that.\nSo,\nI mean, if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly,\nand certainly for medical purposes.",
            "Um, I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century.\nIt's not as strict as it used to be.\nI know, even as I've gotten older, when I was younger, I always went to church every Sunday.\nAnd I would always get cute little dresses.\nAnd matching shoes.\nAnd a matching purse.\nAnd that was just every single Sunday.\nI went to a private school.\nAnd I would see all my friends there on the weekends.\nAnd we would just go.\nBut now, as I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass.\nAnd they cut it down to thirty minutes.\nAnd people dress a lot more casual.\nEspecially during summer people would come in their beach clothes, like straight from the beach.\nYou'd have the families there that are just running in late.\nSo I think it has become more casual.\nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up, people are wearing jeans and khakis.\nWell khakis are nice too.\nBut just a lot more casual in respect to that.\nAs for other things, that's the biggest thing that I noticed.\nLike that's the church I know.\nI don't know the politics into the church and what not.\nBut yeah, that's it.\n\n[OK, um regarding all of the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm, I don't think that these things could have been avoided.\nBecause there are men who are married and they still become pedophiles.\nAnd they still have uh an attraction towards young kids.\nSo I think even if you got them married it's just the person, it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married.\nUm, I think also when they're becoming a priest it's their choice to become a priest.\nUm, there are religions that they're allowed to get married where they could be like on Seventh Heaven, I don't know what kind of title he has.\nHe's a reverend or a minister or something.\n[Mm hmm]\nBut they're allowed to get married.\nSo I know it's a little different.\nBut if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith.\n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm, on which part?\nAbout [Um]\nJust the changing ways [That it really wouldn't make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia.\n[Mm hmm]\nUm, I think, like the whole thing about sexuality, before about being genetics.\nI think it's based on genetics.\nI don't think people um just become it.\nI think they're born that way.\nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up.\nIt might have something to do a little more in this case, but I think it's their genetics.\nAnd you can't hide that through a marriage.\nYou could try, but then it would usually come out.\nSo I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening.\nUm, if they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them.\nBut I don't think in all cases they knew.\n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUm no.",
            "(laughs)\nInitially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext - there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that's very much rubbed me the wrong way, and in general the Iraq war just boils my blood.\n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact.\nEven Colin Powell.\nI mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nAnd\nTo me that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well, since September 11th at least. I mean,\nI think that they\nUm\nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm \nThat last part\n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell\nI do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like\nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because\nUm\nIraq's sovereignty will come to be an issue.\nA major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all.\nThat um \nOh I can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what's happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting\nI guess it was less than a year ago.\nHis party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm \n(laughs)\nNone that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I did\nMmhmm\nJust talk into it?\nOk\nOk cool\nUh huh\nUh\nOk, I'm sorry\nOk\nHow I feel about the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point I feel it's kind of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S.\nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven\nSo I don't feel like\nI mean I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq\nSo I don't like keep up with it\nI don't know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them\nBut it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day\nAnd then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me see\nOhh this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don't know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh this hard\nUh\nMmm\nUhh I don't know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOk\nThank you\nUm\nWell um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair\nI don't think we should call it a war anymore\nBut because I don't think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn't even call it\nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it never was declared a war by congress\nI think that's how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it's\nI just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them\nBut it's also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like\nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it's doing and it's like\nAnd what it's doing to like\nCause remember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he's like saying\nHe'll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don't you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt's like\nIt's hard to say\nI want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it's going to be even worse for them\nAnd it's going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them\nAnd they've been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it's gonna\nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat's about it\nOk",
            "I agree with you. I don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to allow it to be legal. I think it really lies with the churches, because the constitution even says separation of church and state. \n\nIt's clear, clearly stated, and I feel that if we try to do anything with it, exert any kind of power over it, it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone in the constitution.  So, as for the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another because, as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it, except for up in Boston and some of those areas. But I don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal and legal.\n\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much, uh, like a key aspect of the constitution and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they planned on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just contradictory to what's already been said and written there. Plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't feel that's right at all in that aspect.\n\nNo, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic and, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular, and there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else. If anything, it could possibly boost it, I think by, I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\n\n\n Umm, not quite. I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay, here's the English translation:\n\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, to start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq, and I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, one really didn't have that much to do with the other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\nUm\nI\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially to make a preemptive strike. I was against that.\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with...\nI mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died. \nAnd that's horrible and what they were doing was that they were taking out, they were removing the countries government, and I really don't think the government, the American government was prepared for the... what for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\nUm\nAnd here, and the government, and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government, and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam, they were trying to push out Communists, and and to uphold or implement, implement and uphold democracy, and and it is, and it is, and the government, and the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't, that was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't, like it wasn't a clear. \nI mean it was more of a, it was more of a loss in Vietnam because because, because there because there are there are. No matter how many people may have supported, no matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents, and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting an actual army. \nYou're fighting the citizens, the specific citizens in the country and so so I think, I think that the government, so first of all, I think that we shouldn't have gotten into into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and but if you are going to go to war with a country you need to be, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been. I mean worst and either for what would really not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and I mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still, um many American troops are still dying and and there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi and the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that that the US government in a way tried to well they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a a a short successful stay in Iraq and I mean we shouldn't we're kinda we're naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful. I mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was lots of tension and there was civil war and um it's just not an easy thing to do, and I think the government the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do and um so so let's see the war in Iraq well that's, no that's a difficult decision to make because that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of um one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and and so I mean once it's really hard cause once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people I mean we're the ones that took away their government and and their way of life so how can we abandon them now so so its probably something that we should (coughs) excuse me try to see to its finish but them again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and and and how and how much is is too much to to to keep risking for for a free democratic Iraq I mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we're if we're if we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is is the is the oil issue and this is where we are getting our oil from and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found and yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them so I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions. \nLet’s see um I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not.",

            "I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. I think the purpose was good at the beginning, meaning to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose, and we're now maybe just doing it for the sake of doing it, just to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I just think also maybe the motives were originally questionable, considering George Bush's father's previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein. So I think, um, I think the original motivation, if it was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation. If there were any personal matters in it, I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. Um, I think we got our purpose across in the first couple of months, just starting the war. I think that was a statement in itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too drawn out.\n\nUm, yeah, I think, um, I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country that was ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose, and that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think, I think our reason over time has been deteriorated and misconceived, just like it seems that we're still at war for the purpose of going to war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive end, a victory or something.\n\nUm, yeah, I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway, and I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars, when we have our own wars on our own turf, such as poverty and whatnot, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out.\n\nYeah, I mean they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements, you know, um, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify that? Um, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... O okay. Um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if... I mean if you post information on the internet it's... It's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone's profile. You might need to... You know, be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So... I mean, whenever you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost... Hum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, O let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything. Um, I mean I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for... You know some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um like, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know that there's creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this um, this man who just... he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily. And he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that. But I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me and it's hard because you think that they know your interests they know what you look like sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day who your friends are they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean you never know really who can look at what so. Hum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her um high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn't sure how how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that. That's the only other thought I can think of. Yes.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and then one more time that I need to talk about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean I feel hypocritical talking about it\nI mean I hate to say you know\nI hate to join the bandwagon of people who are like, \"Oh, I was against it from the beginning\"\nUm\nI was, but like, it's not really important anymore\nBecause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean you just have to look at like recent polls\nUm\nThey've done United States polls, Iraqi polls, and global polls\nAnd I mean no like\nAbout seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops that are over there\nLike the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI don't know\nIt's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in\nIt was already a disaster\nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean I think it's just\nJust the cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean it's just too big a gap, and for like this administration or previous administrations\nAnd they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist\nLike that's not the way that\nUm\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean sure Saddam was a bad guy\nI don't think anyone's arguing that he's not\nBut, I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to\nYou know turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don't even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don't really see a reason at all to stay in there\nUm\nI mean I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don't agree with them\nI've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now\nUm\nI mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these\nThese are the people that we're trying to save like that we're trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it's not on us if something happens\nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we'll\nI mean if we decide to help out after that we'll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt'll be better than you know where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Yes, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States.\nAnd not only with women, I think it also has to do with the particular field of work that you're dealing with.\nI mean, overall, I think women have it harder because there's the glass ceiling, and even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time finding that they could have to work under a woman if they're a man, just because of how society has been raised for so long.\nAnd often women will see at the workplace a job that they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it.\nBut maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper hands of the business world.\nAnd um, I guess the same thing goes for men.\nAnd in other industries like fashion or\nUm\nBeing a parent at home is really uncommon.\nIt's ähm\nNot typical to have a male parent staying at home.\nAnd um\nOften people look down upon that because society thinks, oh well, you're the male, you should be out working.\nYou should be the money maker of your family.\nWhy are you staying at home?\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job.\nAnd like it's working out fine for them.\nBut society looks down upon that.\nAnd then in the fashion industry\nUm\nPeople won't really take males seriously if they're straight.\nI don't know if that really makes sense.\nBut I guess it's because typically males who are into fashion\nUm\nLike, I guess have different styles of life.\nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, wait, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for a woman?\nLike, you don't really don't know what our case is like.\nLike, these other guys.\"\nSo\nDepending on, like, what field of work you're in,\nI feel like there definitely is gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because the society like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds.\nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO's and they're getting more accepted in the business world and it's a slow process.\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more.\nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads,\nIt's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works.\nAnd um\nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff.\nAnd so they do know like where I'm coming from.\nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy.\nBut um saying like the qualities of them.\nBecause if you force it people are going to resist.\nAnd I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that.\nSo I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist.\nAnd we've come a long ways and change takes time.\nYes\nUm\nWell I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from.\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job.\nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and\nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right.\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you.\nAnd like from gender to gender.\nAnd I don't know\nI guess that'd be another example.\nUm\nNot really.",
            "Well, my understanding is that they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it. Um, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to uh, a to more of like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. Um, and I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, um, those types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would, I mean, usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge. One thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and to house them and then to let them go. And then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times and then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of uh, kind of thought track, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it’s, it’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff. Um, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there’s this whole like financial element to it as well. Other reasons like? Why it shouldn’t necessarily, well no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere and then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving and um, it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don’t really know, um, I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um yeah, uh, no I don’t.",
            "I would say yes because a lot of the things they do are very traditional, like they've done the same things for long periods of time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. And sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. And they also don't accept people of other religions. Like for example, my dad was an Episcopalian. No, I'm sorry, my father was an Episcopalian, my mother was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to, you know, love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nUm, I don't think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior. So because it's just a different realm, um, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nUm, well, I guess, like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a, a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse. So if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent, um, those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless.\n\nNope.",
            "Um, I haven't really made up my mind on this matter yet. So I can't say if either side is right or wrong, but I believe this is the trickiest topic we're facing today because something so close to the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone. So, I don't know, I think that all civil unions, I don't know whether marriage should be looked at and defined by the government, seeing as it is a sacrament like considered, well, people wouldn't get tax breaks or looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized, and so, if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is, it's two people. They shouldn't have a separation of church and state, they shouldn't look into like, well, what kind of marriage was it? Two people got united. So, and the fact that gay marriage, I mean, that would just, oh, two people you got a civil union. Um, well, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It is something like the constitution shouldn't just be amended for something, I mean it is a very big cause for certain people, but it's not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define to ban gay marriage. Simply put, uh, no.",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends. I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, but I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. I feel, though, that it should be something that each state decides on its own rather than, say, the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nWell, a lot of states are democratic and a lot are republican. Obviously, democratic states are going to push for gay marriage. And if you're living in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. And I don't think you're really in a place to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage because you kind of chose to live there, you know? So I think, homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already answered that, but...\n\nYeah, I don't think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don't think, like, Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to run itself, I guess. I don't know. So I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's going to be out of office in like two years and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, like it's just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they're the ones that are going to have to live with that decision, not the president.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change their views. I think that a lot of people are talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its following, and I think it's because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things. Like, for example, gay marriages, abortion, birth control. Things like that. The Catholic Church has very strong views on them, which is fine, but their views are a little bit old-fashioned in some ways. So I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their following. \n\nWell, I've heard that people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of the way they see these situations. People are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects. So I feel that they feel the Catholic Church kind of has the wrong view on things. \n\nI mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion. So if you were for abortion, you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong and you were going against it.\n\nWell, I mean the same I guess with gay marriage and things like that where if that was something that you believed in and that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about, you might not want to be in a following where they didn't agree with that.\n\nI don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or that priests can't be married. But I don't know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened. I mean I don't know, eh? I don't know if they might not have just done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don't know if that would have necessarily changed it.\n\nWell, I mean that was something they did, and that was something that, I don't know, that was something they did, and it might not have really seemed to be affected. I mean, if they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to really tell.\n\nYeah, um, well I don't see why there priests can't be married. I mean, the Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God and they're devoted their complete life. But I don't see everyone else who has a job in the world has their job, then they also have their family life, and the other people they are devoted to, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "Um, well, I'm not against same-sex marriage. I think, regardless of whether you're born that way or whatever, I don't think it's a conscious decision. So I think that people, you know, gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation or whatever. Um, so I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't really. (Pause) I haven't really thought about the topic that much, but, uhm, yeah, I would definitely say it's wrong to say that.\n\nUm, so it seems that it's not really a choice. So, they don't really have a choice about how they are. Like, uhm, I mean, I was born straight, and you know, another person is born gay, I guess. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for if you know what I mean.\n\n(Pause, clears throat) Ah yeah, I would definitely think it's wrong to do that. I don't really think the federal government should be involved because it's more of, uhm, I don't think it's a legal issue. I, I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue. Um, I mean again, like I don't think these, uhm, gay people should be, um, how do I say, ah, um, should be put, like I mean, like, on a stage like they're, you know, like it's wrong, like, like, that they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever.\n\nSo I don't think the federal government really has any say. \n\nUm, it's hard.\n\n(laughs)\n\nUm, ok, well, um, I don't think the federal government should be involved because it is, I mean, it's nothing involving the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that, it's not like, it just seems like they're out of place, it doesn't seem like they have any right to, to interject in people's lives, and, and you know, that's just who they are, the, who, who, uhm, you know, gay people, that's just like how they were born or at least that's what I think, and I mean, it's, they shouldn't be punished for that.\n\nUh no, that's it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's not a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. There are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. And there are a bunch of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin, I don't want to say next of kin because I'm not sure that that's what it is, but if you're in a gay couple then your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's kind of a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success; they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just, it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's not involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation: separate but unequal. Yeah, they are; they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community and especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's um, sexual orientation choices or not, but well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is um, how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society like in New York City I know they um, they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get like beaten up, and stuff like that parents protest to get the child removed from their school and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples and so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to; I mean it's just about personality choices. \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion, well his um, his take on gay marriage actually um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which um, I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but the most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about um, under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country um, just one lots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect and that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.",
            "Well, first off, I work at the hospital pharmacy over the summer.\nYou know, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has positive properties.\nSo, I mean, as far as having it available for the public, I'd say no, absolutely not.\nBut, if it's used for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes, because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial, it's not beneficial, you know what I mean?\n\nYeah, so, I mean there are a lot of illegal drugs that pharmacies use,\nlike oxycodone,\nVicodin,\nPercocet,\nthat kind of thing.\nAnd those are controlled substances,\nbut we use them all the time because they're beneficial, and if you deny those benefits\njust because there's a taboo around marijuana then,\nI mean, there's no point in doing that for me.\nYou should embrace its positive properties, I think.\n\nWell, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana,\nalthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things.\nWell, it's a tough one.\nI'd say,\nnot,\nyou could integrate it,\nlike let it become legal gradually but not all at once,\nbecause then it would be abused, but if you just,\nyou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first,\nand then people might use it responsibly.\n\nUm, yeah,\npeople have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug.\nBut, I mean it's not that bad for you.\nIt's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that.\nSo,\nI mean, if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly,\nand certainly for medical purposes.",
            "Um, I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century.\nIt's not as strict as it used to be.\nI know, even as I've gotten older, when I was younger, I always went to church every Sunday.\nAnd I would always get cute little dresses.\nAnd matching shoes.\nAnd a matching purse.\nAnd that was just every single Sunday.\nI went to a private school.\nAnd I would see all my friends there on the weekends.\nAnd we would just go.\nBut now, as I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass.\nAnd they cut it down to thirty minutes.\nAnd people dress a lot more casual.\nEspecially during summer people would come in their beach clothes, like straight from the beach.\nYou'd have the families there that are just running in late.\nSo I think it has become more casual.\nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up, people are wearing jeans and khakis.\nWell khakis are nice too.\nBut just a lot more casual in respect to that.\nAs for other things, that's the biggest thing that I noticed.\nLike that's the church I know.\nI don't know the politics into the church and what not.\nBut yeah, that's it.\n\n[OK, um regarding all of the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm, I don't think that these things could have been avoided.\nBecause there are men who are married and they still become pedophiles.\nAnd they still have uh an attraction towards young kids.\nSo I think even if you got them married it's just the person, it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married.\nUm, I think also when they're becoming a priest it's their choice to become a priest.\nUm, there are religions that they're allowed to get married where they could be like on Seventh Heaven, I don't know what kind of title he has.\nHe's a reverend or a minister or something.\n[Mm hmm]\nBut they're allowed to get married.\nSo I know it's a little different.\nBut if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith.\n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm, on which part?\nAbout [Um]\nJust the changing ways [That it really wouldn't make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia.\n[Mm hmm]\nUm, I think, like the whole thing about sexuality, before about being genetics.\nI think it's based on genetics.\nI don't think people um just become it.\nI think they're born that way.\nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up.\nIt might have something to do a little more in this case, but I think it's their genetics.\nAnd you can't hide that through a marriage.\nYou could try, but then it would usually come out.\nSo I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening.\nUm, if they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them.\nBut I don't think in all cases they knew.\n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUm no.",
            "(laughs)\nInitially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext - there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that's very much rubbed me the wrong way, and in general the Iraq war just boils my blood.\n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact.\nEven Colin Powell.\nI mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nAnd\nTo me that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well, since September 11th at least. I mean,\nI think that they\nUm\nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm \nThat last part\n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell\nI do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like\nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because\nUm\nIraq's sovereignty will come to be an issue.\nA major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all.\nThat um \nOh I can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what's happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting\nI guess it was less than a year ago.\nHis party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm \n(laughs)\nNone that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I did\nMmhmm\nJust talk into it?\nOk\nOk cool\nUh huh\nUh\nOk, I'm sorry\nOk\nHow I feel about the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point I feel it's kind of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S.\nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven\nSo I don't feel like\nI mean I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq\nSo I don't like keep up with it\nI don't know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them\nBut it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day\nAnd then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me see\nOhh this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don't know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh this hard\nUh\nMmm\nUhh I don't know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOk\nThank you\nUm\nWell um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair\nI don't think we should call it a war anymore\nBut because I don't think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn't even call it\nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it never was declared a war by congress\nI think that's how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it's\nI just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them\nBut it's also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like\nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it's doing and it's like\nAnd what it's doing to like\nCause remember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he's like saying\nHe'll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don't you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt's like\nIt's hard to say\nI want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it's going to be even worse for them\nAnd it's going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them\nAnd they've been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it's gonna\nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat's about it\nOk",
            "I agree with you. I don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to allow it to be legal. I think it really lies with the churches, because the constitution even says separation of church and state. \n\nIt's clear, clearly stated, and I feel that if we try to do anything with it, exert any kind of power over it, it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone in the constitution.  So, as for the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another because, as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it, except for up in Boston and some of those areas. But I don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal and legal.\n\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much, uh, like a key aspect of the constitution and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they planned on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just contradictory to what's already been said and written there. Plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't feel that's right at all in that aspect.\n\nNo, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic and, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular, and there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else. If anything, it could possibly boost it, I think by, I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\n\n\n Umm, not quite. I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay, here's the English translation:\n\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, to start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq, and I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, one really didn't have that much to do with the other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\nUm\nI\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially to make a preemptive strike. I was against that.\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with...\nI mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died. \nAnd that's horrible and what they were doing was that they were taking out, they were removing the countries government, and I really don't think the government, the American government was prepared for the... what for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\nUm\nAnd here, and the government, and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government, and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam, they were trying to push out Communists, and and to uphold or implement, implement and uphold democracy, and and it is, and it is, and the government, and the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't, that was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't, like it wasn't a clear. \nI mean it was more of a, it was more of a loss in Vietnam because because, because there because there are there are. No matter how many people may have supported, no matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents, and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting an actual army. \nYou're fighting the citizens, the specific citizens in the country and so so I think, I think that the government, so first of all, I think that we shouldn't have gotten into into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and but if you are going to go to war with a country you need to be, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been. I mean worst and either for what would really not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and I mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still, um many American troops are still dying and and there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi and the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that that the US government in a way tried to well they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a a a short successful stay in Iraq and I mean we shouldn't we're kinda we're naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful. I mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was lots of tension and there was civil war and um it's just not an easy thing to do, and I think the government the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do and um so so let's see the war in Iraq well that's, no that's a difficult decision to make because that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of um one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and and so I mean once it's really hard cause once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people I mean we're the ones that took away their government and and their way of life so how can we abandon them now so so its probably something that we should (coughs) excuse me try to see to its finish but them again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and and and how and how much is is too much to to to keep risking for for a free democratic Iraq I mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we're if we're if we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is is the is the oil issue and this is where we are getting our oil from and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found and yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them so I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions. \nLet’s see um I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not.",

            "I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. I think the purpose was good at the beginning, meaning to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose, and we're now maybe just doing it for the sake of doing it, just to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I just think also maybe the motives were originally questionable, considering George Bush's father's previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein. So I think, um, I think the original motivation, if it was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation. If there were any personal matters in it, I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. Um, I think we got our purpose across in the first couple of months, just starting the war. I think that was a statement in itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too drawn out.\n\nUm, yeah, I think, um, I mean, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country that was ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose, and that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think, I think our reason over time has been deteriorated and misconceived, just like it seems that we're still at war for the purpose of going to war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive end, a victory or something.\n\nUm, yeah, I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway, and I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars, when we have our own wars on our own turf, such as poverty and whatnot, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out.\n\nYeah, I mean they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements, you know, um, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify that? Um, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... O okay. Um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if... I mean if you post information on the internet it's... It's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone's profile. You might need to... You know, be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So... I mean, whenever you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost... Hum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, O let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything. Um, I mean I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for... You know some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um like, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know that there's creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this um, this man who just... he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily. And he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that. But I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me and it's hard because you think that they know your interests they know what you look like sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day who your friends are they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean you never know really who can look at what so. Hum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her um high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn't sure how how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that.

            "Yes, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States.\nAnd not only with women, I think it also has to do with the particular field of work that you're dealing with.\nI mean, overall, I think women have it harder because there's the glass ceiling, and even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time finding that they could have to work under a woman if they're a man, just because of how society has been raised for so long.\nAnd often women will see at the workplace a job that they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it.\nBut maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper hands of the business world.\nAnd um, I guess the same thing goes for men.\nAnd in other industries like fashion or\nUm\nBeing a parent at home is really uncommon.\nIt's ähm\nNot typical to have a male parent staying at home.\nAnd um\nOften people look down upon that because society thinks, oh well, you're the male, you should be out working.\nYou should be the money maker of your family.\nWhy are you staying at home?\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job.\nAnd like it's working out fine for them.\nBut society looks down upon that.\nAnd then in the fashion industry\nUm\nPeople won't really take males seriously if they're straight.\nI don't know if that really makes sense.\nBut I guess it's because typically males who are into fashion\nUm\nLike, I guess have different styles of life.\nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, wait, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for a woman?\nLike, you don't really don't know what our case is like.\nLike, these other guys.\"\nSo\nDepending on, like, what field of work you're in,\nI feel like there definitely is gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because the society like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds.\nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO's and they're getting more accepted in the business world and it's a slow process.\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more.\nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads,\nIt's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works.\nAnd um\nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff.\nAnd so they do know like where I'm coming from.\nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy.\nBut um saying like the qualities of them.\nBecause if you force it people are going to resist.\nAnd I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that.\nSo I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist.\nAnd we've come a long ways and change takes time.\nYes\nUm\nWell I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from.\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job.\nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and\nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right.\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you.\nAnd like from gender to gender.\nAnd I don't know\nI guess that'd be another example.\nUm\nNot really.",
            "Well, my understanding is that they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it. Um, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to uh, a to more of like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. Um, and I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, um, those types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would, I mean, usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge. One thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and to house them and then to let them go. And then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times and then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of uh, kind of thought track, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it’s, it’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff. Um, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there’s this whole like financial element to it as well. Other reasons like? Why it shouldn’t necessarily, well no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere and then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving and um, it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don’t really know, um, I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um yeah, uh, no I don’t.",
            "I would say yes because a lot of the things they do are very traditional, like they've done the same things for long periods of time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. And sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. And they also don't accept people of other religions. Like for example, my dad was an Episcopalian. No, I'm sorry, my father was an Episcopalian, my mother was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to, you know, love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nUm, I don't think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior. So because it's just a different realm, um, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nUm, well, I guess, like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a, a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse. So if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent, um, those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless.\n\nNope.",
            "Um, I haven't really made up my mind on this matter yet. So I can't say if either side is right or wrong, but I believe this is the trickiest topic we're facing today because something so close to the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone. So, I don't know, I think that all civil unions, I don't know whether marriage should be looked at and defined by the government, seeing as it is a sacrament like considered, well, people wouldn't get tax breaks or looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized, and so, if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is, it's two people. They shouldn't have a separation of church and state, they shouldn't look into like, well, what kind of marriage was it? Two people got united. So, and the fact that gay marriage, I mean, that would just, oh, two people you got a civil union. Um, well, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It is something like the constitution shouldn't just be amended for something, I mean it is a very big cause for certain people, but it's not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define to ban gay marriage. Simply put, uh, no.",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends. I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, but I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. I feel, though, that it should be something that each state decides on its own rather than, say, the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nWell, a lot of states are democratic and a lot are republican. Obviously, democratic states are going to push for gay marriage. And if you're living in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. And I don't think you're really in a place to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage because you kind of chose to live there, you know? So I think, homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already answered that, but...\n\nYeah, I don't think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don't think, like, Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to run itself, I guess. I don't know. So I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's going to be out of office in like two years and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, like it's just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they're the ones that are going to have to live with that decision, not the president.",
