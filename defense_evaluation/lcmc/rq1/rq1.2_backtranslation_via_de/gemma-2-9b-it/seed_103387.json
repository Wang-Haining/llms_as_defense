            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in some ways the Catholic Church does need to change its views.  A lot of people are talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it’s because the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of many things. \n\nFor example,  gay marriages, abortion, birth control.\n\nThe Catholic Church has very strong views on these things, which is fine. But I think their views are a little old-fashioned in some ways. So I think that if they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking they wouldn’t be worried about losing their following.\n\nI’ve heard that many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little because of the way they see these situations. And people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. So I feel they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things.\n\nI mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you are for abortion, you might not be comfortable in a following where that is taught to be completely wrong and that you are going against it.\n\nIt’s the same with gay marriage and things like that. If that was something you believed in and wanted to do or even just felt strongly about, you might not want to be in a following where they don’t agree with that.\n\nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or why priests can’t be married. But I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened. I mean, I don’t know. They might not have done that even if they were allowed to be married or if there were female priests. But I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it.\n\nWell, I mean, that was something they did, and that was something… I don’t know… That was something they did, and it didn’t really seem to be affected.\n\nI mean, if they were married, would they have done it differently? It’s hard to really tell.\n\nWell, I don’t see why priests can’t be married.\n\nI mean, the Catholic Church really says that priests are basically married to God and they devote their whole life to him. But I don’t see why everyone else who has a job in the world has their job and then they also have their family life and the other people they are devoted to, so I don’t see why priests can’t have both.",
            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage. I think whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not a conscious choice. So I think people, you know, gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. So I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't really.\n\nI haven't really thought a lot about the topic, but I would definitely say it's wrong for them to say that. It doesn't seem like a choice. Like they don't really have a choice on how they are, like I was born straight and another person is born gay, I guess. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held responsible for.\n\nI would definitely think it's wrong to do that. I don't really think the federal government should be involved because it's more of a... I don't think it's a legal issue. I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue. I mean, again, I don't think these gay people should be... how do I say... put on a stage like they're, you know, like it's wrong, like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever.\n\nSo I don't think the federal government really has any say.\n\nIt's hard.\n\n(laughs)\n\nOk, well, I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's, I mean, it's nothing involving the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that, it's not like... it just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interject in people's lives, and that's just who they are, the, who, who, you know, gay people, that's just like how they were born, or at least that's what I think, and I mean, they shouldn't be punished for that.\n\nUh no, that's it.",
            "**\nI think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's not really a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. There are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's the same thing. And there are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where, um, your primary or your, I don't want to say next of kin, because I'm not sure that that's what it is, but if you're in a gay couple then your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit, because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's kind of a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates. They have the same, um, factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's not involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation: separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that, and people worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community, and especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll, um, be influenced by their parent's, um, sexual orientation choices or not, but again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers and other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they, um, they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City, they get like beaten up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid. I mean, they're going to have the same points of view and everything. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples, and they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to. I mean, it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own, having to do with his religion. Well, his, um, his take on gay marriage actually, um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research, which, um, I think most of the reasons, I'm not sure about this because, honestly, I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality, I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and, um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account, to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about, um, under God in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and that the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood, not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is. And if people listened to, um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. \nIt's not as strict as it used to be. \nI know, even as I grew up when I was younger, I would always go to church every Sunday. \nAnd I would always wear cute little dresses. \nAnd matching shoes. \nAnd a matching purse. \nAnd that was just every single week. \nI went to a private school. \nAnd I would see all my friends there on the weekends. \nAnd we would just go. \nBut now that I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass. \nAnd they've cut it down to thirty minutes. \nAnd people dress a lot more casual. \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes, like straight from the beach. \nYou'd have the families there that are just running in late. \nSo I think it has become more casual. \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis. \nWell khakis are nice too. \nBut just a lot more casual in respect to that. \nAs for other things, that's the biggest thing that I noticed. \nLike that's the church I know. \nI don't know the politics into the church and what not. \nBut yeah, that's it.\n\n[OK, um regarding all of the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm, I don't think that these things could have been avoided. \nBecause there are married men \nAnd they still become pedophiles. \nAnd they still have \nUh, \nAn attraction towards young kids. \nSo I think even if you got them married it's just the person it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. \nUm, I think also when they're becoming a priest it's their choice to become a priest. \nUm, \nThere are religions that they're allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven. \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something. \n[Mm hmm]\nBut they're allowed to get married. \nSo I know it's a little different. \nBut, if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith. \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm, \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm, \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics. \nI think it's based on genetics. \nI don't think people \nUm \nJust become it. \nI think they're born that way. \nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up. \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case. \nBut \nI think it's their genetics. \nAnd you can't hide that through a marriage. \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out. \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them. \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew. \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUm no.",
            "(laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that's very much rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell\nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nAnd \nTo me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since. Well, since September 11th at least. I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm \nThat last part\n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell \nI do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq's sovereignty will come to be an issue. A major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I've heard, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That um \nOh, I can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what's happening, and even Mugtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess, it was less than a year ago, his party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we're still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm \n(laughs)\nNone that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I did\nMhm\nJust talk into it?\nOkay\nOkay, cool\nUm\nOkay, I'm sorry\nOkay\nHow I feel about the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point I feel it's kind of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S.\nLike who had done the terrorist attacks on nine eleven\nSo I don't feel like\nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq\nSo I don't like keep up with it\nI don't know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them\nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day\nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me see\nOhh this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh this hard\nUm\nMmm\nUhh I don’t know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOkay\nThank you\nUm\nWell um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair\nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore\nBut because I don’t think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn’t even call it\nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it never was declared a war by congress\nI think that’s how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it’s\nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them\nBut it’s also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like\nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like\nAnd what it’s doing to like\nCause remember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he’s like saying\nHe’ll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt’s like\nIt’s hard to say\nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it’s going to be even worse for them\nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them\nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know\nI feel like it’s gonna\nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat’s about it\nOkay",
            "Um\nI really don't feel comfortable with it,\nthinking it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as legal.\nI think it really comes down to the churches, because the constitution even says separation of church and state.\nIt's clear,\nIt's clear.\nUm\nIt is\nA clear thing and I feel that trying to do anything with it,\ntrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone in the constitution.\nSo,\nUm,\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another,\nBecause as we can see, most Catholics\nUm, Catholics and Christians are really against it\nand don't support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas.\nBut um,\nI don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal,\nand legal.\n\nUm,\nSeparation of church and state is pretty much\nUm, like been a key aspect of the constitution\nand what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just contradictory to what's already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government.\nSo I don't feel that's right at all\nIn that aspect.\n\nUm,\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue.\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that's it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd,\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion.\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything,\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don't know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on the society\nSociety than it would not.\n\n\nUmm,\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay, \n\nThe war in Iraq. Well, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, the two didn't have much to do with each other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. \n\nI am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. A tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that's horrible. They were taking out the country's government, and I don't think the American government was prepared for the aftermath, the void of power, and the chaos that would occur.\n\nThe United States is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold or implement democracy. The US government should have known that it would be a long and hard ordeal that probably wouldn't be a clear victory, like Vietnam.\n\n\nThere will always be insurgents, no matter how many people support the US, and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting a real army. You're fighting the citizens of the country. We shouldn't have gone to war in the first place, but if we did, we needed to plan for all possible outcomes. The government wasn't prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We're still there today, almost the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country, which will take a long time. The US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq.\n\nWe are naive for believing that because it takes time to implement a new form of government. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle, with tension and civil war. The US government made it seem easy. \n\nIt's a difficult decision because if we went in there, how can we abandon these people? \n\nWe took away their government and way of life. The consideration of the casualties and the cost of a free democratic Iraq is a huge issue. \n\nWhy is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this to other countries?\n\nThe oil issue is a big factor. Another reason for the war was that Iraq was believed to have weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. North Korea, which we know has weapons of mass destruction, isn't being attacked. \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace, but it probably won't.",

I always have been. \nUm, I really think it's a personal preference and uh...\nAnd it's something that's been proven more and more now that it could be biological as opposed to sociological, so to to give people less rights due to something that's really not any of their control.\nUm,\nDue to their control.\nI think it's kinda inhumane.\nAnd uh,\nI've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nUh, I don't think there's any...\nI think that politics and government in general shouldn't have a part in this it's it's...\nYou, it's not even at a state level it's a personal level it's a household level.\nUm,\nYou know my neighborhood at home there's I think two or three openly gay couples not...\nYou know not married or anything because they're not allowed to.\nUm,\nBut they they function the same way that any other family would.\nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that...\nUm,\nWith you know...\nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to.\nI think its...\nI think it's kind of ridiculous.\n\nSure yeah.\nI mean I think...\nI mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever, it's its something now that a chemical thing in your brain.\nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual.\nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it.\nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological.\n\nUm,\nWell other other than\nI guess the obvious it's you know in this...\nI think maybe cause marriage is something that...\nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know.\nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private sector type thing opposed to\nUm,\nAs opposed to public domain and um\nNational\nUm federal domain.\n\nUh no.\nNo.",
            "So, when you put something on the internet, it's public. It's completely public. You can't - I mean, as an RA, it's something I've actually had to deal with already. When you put something out there, it influences people's opinions of you. And if you're talking about blowing things up or if you're talking about shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there, put that into the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school and they have to act on that. They can't let it sit because then, God forbid something does happen, they could have prevented it. [Right]\n\nAgain, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a - for a sociology class. Sorry, couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they reported it. When we finally found out who the person was, they looked through a friend of his Facebook and got very worried because there were some things on there that he may have meant as a joke but in light of the situation became very serious.\n\nWhen you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking and going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it. And if there's danger they have to take it seriously.\n\nI mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs and if it's brought to their attention then it's something completely different.\n\nUm, yeah don't. Like a teacher should not make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just, it's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place so I don't even want that, that connection there. Um, not really.",
            "Um, I feel like the war has been drawn out far too long. I think the initial goal was good, namely to restore democracy in another country. But I think we have long since lost sight of that goal. And we are maybe just doing it out of principle, just to prove that we are some kind of superpower in the world. I also think that the original motives were questionable, having to do with the previous disputes of George Bush's father with Saddam Hussein. So, I think... I think if the original motivation was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, if there were any personal matters in it, I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it has dragged on too long. Um, I think we achieved our purpose in the first couple of months when we started the war, I think that was a statement in itself. But the fact that it has lasted for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too drawn out. \n\nUm, yeah, I think, um, I mean, if our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, then that's a just purpose, and that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think, I think our reason over time has deteriorated and been misunderstood. It seems like we're still at war for the sake of going to war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive end, a victory or something. \n\nUm, yeah, I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials are going to have to fend for themselves anyway, and I think that time has come. We have long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf, such as poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out. \n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are things obviously like poverty or internal improvements, you know, um, public roads or anything dealing with schools, we certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money’s being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for.\n\nI think that's it.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify this? Um, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was something like that. O okay. Um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if I mean, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace you know, you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile. You might need to, you know, be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum. Um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Oh let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything\". Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at peoples' profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile, or was someone just randomly looking at peoples' and just randomly happened to see that, or were they actually looking for, you know, some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So I don't really know.\n\nSure. Um, well, um, like, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know that there's creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on tv once that was about this. Um, this man who just, he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that. But I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like. Sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are. They pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know really who can look at what. So.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her, um, high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how, how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think, I don't really know, how they had the right to tell people. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\n\nYes.",
            "We only have this and then one more time that I need to talk about the Iraq War. I mean I feel hypocritical talking about it. I mean I hate to say you know, I hate to join the bandwagon of people that are like, oh I was against it from the beginning. Um, I was but like it’s not really important anymore. Cause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong. And um, I mean you just have to look at like the recent polls. They’ve done United States polls, they’ve done Iraqi polls, they’ve done global polls, and I mean no like about seventy five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea, eighty percent of Iraqis. Um, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. Um, I don’t know, it’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There’s really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore. Um, I mean I think it’s just, just the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations. And they think that they can just like bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist. Like that’s not the way that, um, this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean sure Saddam was a bad guy, I don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not, but I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to, you know, turn into just a complete disaster, just like quicksand from when we went over there. Um, I don’t even know what to say about it. Um, I don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there. Um, I mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there, um, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out. I don’t agree with them. I’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. Um, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that. But, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now. Um, I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people that we’re trying to save, like that we’re trying to help, telling us to leave. Um, you know I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens. You know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. Um, and then you know at least we’ll, I mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys. Kind of, not really, no. We’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it’ll be better than you know where we are, where we stand right now. Um, yeah, uh, no.",
            "I feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. And it's not just against women. I think it has to do with the specific field of work you are in. I mean, overall, I think women have it harder because of the glass ceiling. Even though equality is supposed to exist, most people have a hard time working under a woman if they are a man, just because of how society has been raised for so long. And so women often see a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically, women aren't usually seen in the upper echelons of the business world. And um, I guess the same thing goes for men, and for other industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. It's really uncommon to have a male parent staying at home, and a lot of times people look down on that because society thinks, \"Oh, well, you're the male, you should be out working, you should be the money maker of your family. Why are you staying at home?\" And it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down on that.  And then in the fashion industry, um a lot of times people won't really take males seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I guess it's because typically males who are into fashion, um, I guess have different lifestyles, and so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, wait, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for a woman? Like you don't really know what our situation is like like these other guys.\" And so depending on what field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and obviously, we have come a long way from the 1800s, leaps and bounds. But change is really slow, so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And just as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works,\" and um, and then for like fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff.\" And so they do know like where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them because if you force it people are going to resist. And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that, so I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way and change takes time. Yes, um, well I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself, like you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, and even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, so sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example, um, not really.",
            "Well, my understanding is that they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it.  Hmm, that took it down from a criminal offense to, uh, something like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. Um, and I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited for that, then you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would, I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge. One thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time there is an argument that, uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and to house them and then to let them go. And then it costs a lot, you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times and then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of uh, kind of thought track, then I think it’s totally fine. And I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it’s, it’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff. Um, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there’s this whole like financial element to it as well. Other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily, well, no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana. So, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what?  The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don’t really know, um, I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um, but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes because a lot of the things they do are very traditional, like they’ve done the same things for long periods of time, and it’s good to be rooted in tradition, but it’s also important to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and they’re very strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee and they don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics. They also don’t accept people of other religions. Like, for example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad’s religion. And that’s not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that’s a Catholic teaching, but it’s hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then Catholic practice goes against it because it’s so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don’t think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior, because it’s just a different realm. It might, but I probably don’t think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it’s a child which is different than a spouse. So if you’re going to do something like that, you’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married. Like, I don’t think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "Um, I haven't really made up my mind about this issue yet. So, I can't say if either side is right or wrong. But I believe that this is the trickiest topic we're facing today because something so close between separation of church and state and how to define marriage is something that is very hard to do without offending anyone.\n\nSo, I don't know, I think that... all civil unions... I don't know whether marriage should be looked at... and... how it should be defined by the government... Since it is a sacrament like considered... Well, people wouldn't get tax breaks... Or... looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized... And... so... If you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union... Because... that's what it is... It's two people... They shouldn't have separation of church and state... They shouldn't look into like well what kind of marriage was it... Two people got united... So... and... the fact that gay marriage... I mean... that would just... Oh, two people you got a civil union...\n\nUm... Well, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law. But... a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It is... something like the constitution shouldn't just be amended for something... I mean, it is a very big cause for certain people... But... it's not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment.\n\nIt's just not important enough to amend the constitution... to define... to ban gay marriage. Simply put...\n\nUh... No.",
            "Um, I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends. Um, I think I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, but I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I believe that it should be something that each state decides on its own, instead of, um, like, the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nUm, like a lot of states are democratic and, and a lot of states are republican. Obviously, democratic states are going to push for gay marriage, and, and if you're living in a democratic state, then you know, obviously, how that state feels about that position. And, and I don't think that you're necessarily in a position to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage, because you kind of chose to live there. You know, so I, like, I think, I don't, I think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already answered that, but, um, yeah, I don't feel as though, um, Bush should be allowed to, um, decide, um, um, that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the, um, individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nUm, I just, I just don't think, like, I don't think that, like, Bush doesn't live in every single state. So, he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to run, um, run itself, I guess, I don't know, um, so, I think that, um, some things should be left up to, um, each individual state. Plus, he's going to be out of office in like, what, two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, like, it's just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they're the ones that are going to have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.",
            "Um, no, I don't at all. Um, let's see. I figure Myspace is a public thing, and a bulletin board. You know, if you look at the definition, then you know, that's basically to post for the public to see or others to see, whatever you're trying to get at. And, if you post that on the internet, you know, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it be school officials or not. So, in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed it through their homes. Um, but yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here. Like, um, you know, if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking, smoking, or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble. And I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. But, um, I feel as though as long as they save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that?\n\nYeah, um, alright. Well, um, hmm, it's a lot easier to express yourself a lot longer when you're writing, but alright, well, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Um, everything, like, I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails. Um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up, and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and, you know, bites you in the butt I guess you could say. Um, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they will like find an email that you sent somehow, and like once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and, um, you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it; you will get in trouble. And I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy because, you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and, um, I don't know, let's see here.\n\n Um, like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them, or um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a, um, a teacher of mine. I went to a public high school, and um, they say you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff, and that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks. Uh, we had to be safe about that. We had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the well I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because um, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff um, in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case; they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. Uh, no, that's about it.",
            "Okay, so, at first I was all for the war because 9/11 affected me personally. I was for going over there and causing as much havoc as they did here. I think because it was such an emotional event, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan. And I really think that it backfired on us. Um, I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us too. Like, I don't think us being over there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. So, unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've almost just, I just don't care about what goes on over there with those people. I just don't care. I just think, I don't think they're human sometimes. I don't know, they fight with each other and they can't, they just can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care. Um, I don't know, we definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't know what we were going to face over there. Um, and it's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. They're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country. I just think they're looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. Um, we just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything. I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and, um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from. We really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say ok let's rebuild and that's it. So, um, I don't think we could have let it go. But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess, like creating order. And I don't know, I just think that they didn't, there was no like unity. They didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. So that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly, I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on definitely long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress. Like we've made progress, but not enough to stay in there. And I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just gonna collapse. And we can't stay over there forever. So I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No. Okay."

heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in some ways the Catholic Church does need to change its views.  A lot of people are talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it’s because the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of many things. \n\nFor example,  gay marriages, abortion, birth control.\n\nThe Catholic Church has very strong views on these things, which is fine. But I think their views are a little old-fashioned in some ways. So I think that if they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking they wouldn’t be worried about losing their following.\n\nI’ve heard that many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little because of the way they see these situations. And people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. So I feel they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things.\n\nI mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you are for abortion, you might not be comfortable in a following where that is taught to be completely wrong and that you are going against it.\n\nIt’s the same with gay marriage and things like that. If that was something you believed in and wanted to do or even just felt strongly about, you might not want to be in a following where they don’t agree with that.\n\nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or why priests can’t be married. But I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened. I mean, I don’t know. They might not have done that even if they were allowed to be married or if there were female priests. But I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it.\n\nWell, I mean, that was something they did, and that was something… I don’t know… That was something they did, and it didn’t really seem to be affected.\n\nI mean, if they were married, would they have done it differently? It’s hard to really tell.\n\nWell, I don’t see why priests can’t be married.\n\nI mean, the Catholic Church really says that priests are basically married to God and they devote their whole life to him. But I don’t see why everyone else who has a job in the world has their job and then they also have their family life and the other people they are devoted to, so I don’t see why priests can’t have both.",
            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage. I think whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not a conscious choice. So I think people, you know, gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. So I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't really.\n\nI haven't really thought a lot about the topic, but I would definitely say it's wrong for them to say that. It doesn't seem like a choice. Like they don't really have a choice on how they are, like I was born straight and another person is born gay, I guess. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held responsible for.\n\nI would definitely think it's wrong to do that. I don't really think the federal government should be involved because it's more of a... I don't think it's a legal issue. I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue. I mean, again, I don't think these gay people should be... how do I say... put on a stage like they're, you know, like it's wrong, like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever.\n\nSo I don't think the federal government really has any say.\n\nIt's hard.\n\n(laughs)\n\nOk, well, I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's, I mean, it's nothing involving the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that, it's not like... it just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interject in people's lives, and that's just who they are, the, who, who, you know, gay people, that's just like how they were born, or at least that's what I think, and I mean, they shouldn't be punished for that.\n\nUh no, that's it.",
            "**\nI think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's not really a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. There are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's the same thing. And there are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where, um, your primary or your, I don't want to say next of kin, because I'm not sure that that's what it is, but if you're in a gay couple then your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit, because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's kind of a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates. They have the same, um, factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's not involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation: separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that, and people worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community, and especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll, um, be influenced by their parent's, um, sexual orientation choices or not, but again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers and other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they, um, they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City, they get like beaten up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid. I mean, they're going to have the same points of view and everything. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples, and they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to. I mean, it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own, having to do with his religion. Well, his, um, his take on gay marriage actually, um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research, which, um, I think most of the reasons, I'm not sure about this because, honestly, I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality, I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and, um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account, to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about, um, under God in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and that the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood, not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is. And if people listened to, um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "Um, so first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and...\n\nYou know, just because a drug is illegal, doesn't mean it has beneficial properties.\n\nUm, so, I mean, as far as its availability to the public, I'd say no, absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes, because... just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial.

            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. \nIt's not as strict as it used to be. \nI know, even as I grew up when I was younger, I would always go to church every Sunday. \nAnd I would always wear cute little dresses. \nAnd matching shoes. \nAnd a matching purse. \nAnd that was just every single week. \nI went to a private school. \nAnd I would see all my friends there on the weekends. \nAnd we would just go. \nBut now that I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass. \nAnd they've cut it down to thirty minutes. \nAnd people dress a lot more casual. \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes, like straight from the beach. \nYou'd have the families there that are just running in late. \nSo I think it has become more casual. \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis. \nWell khakis are nice too. \nBut just a lot more casual in respect to that. \nAs for other things, that's the biggest thing that I noticed. \nLike that's the church I know. \nI don't know the politics into the church and what not. \nBut yeah, that's it.\n\n[OK, um regarding all of the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm, I don't think that these things could have been avoided. \nBecause there are married men \nAnd they still become pedophiles. \nAnd they still have \nUh, \nAn attraction towards young kids. \nSo I think even if you got them married it's just the person it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. \nUm, I think also when they're becoming a priest it's their choice to become a priest. \nUm, \nThere are religions that they're allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven. \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something. \n[Mm hmm]\nBut they're allowed to get married. \nSo I know it's a little different. \nBut, if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith. \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm, \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm, \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics. \nI think it's based on genetics. \nI don't think people \nUm \nJust become it. \nI think they're born that way. \nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up. \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case. \nBut \nI think it's their genetics. \nAnd you can't hide that through a marriage. \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out. \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them. \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew. \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUm no.",
            "(laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that's very much rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell\nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nAnd \nTo me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since. Well, since September 11th at least. I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm \nThat last part\n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell \nI do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq's sovereignty will come to be an issue. A major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I've heard, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That um \nOh, I can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what's happening, and even Mugtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess, it was less than a year ago, his party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we're still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm \n(laughs)\nNone that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I did\nMhm\nJust talk into it?\nOkay\nOkay, cool\nUm\nOkay, I'm sorry\nOkay\nHow I feel about the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point I feel it's kind of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S.\nLike who had done the terrorist attacks on nine eleven\nSo I don't feel like\nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq\nSo I don't like keep up with it\nI don't know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them\nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day\nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me see\nOhh this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh this hard\nUm\nMmm\nUhh I don’t know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOkay\nThank you\nUm\nWell um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair\nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore\nBut because I don’t think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn’t even call it\nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it never was declared a war by congress\nI think that’s how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it’s\nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them\nBut it’s also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like\nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like\nAnd what it’s doing to like\nCause remember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he’s like saying\nHe’ll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt’s like\nIt’s hard to say\nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it’s going to be even worse for them\nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them\nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know\nI feel like it’s gonna\nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat’s about it\nOkay",
            "Um\nI really don't feel comfortable with it,\nthinking it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as legal.\nI think it really comes down to the churches, because the constitution even says separation of church and state.\nIt's clear,\nIt's clear.\nUm\nIt is\nA clear thing and I feel that trying to do anything with it,\ntrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone in the constitution.\nSo,\nUm,\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another,\nBecause as we can see, most Catholics\nUm, Catholics and Christians are really against it\nand don't support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas.\nBut um,\nI don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal,\nand legal.\n\nUm,\nSeparation of church and state is pretty much\nUm, like been a key aspect of the constitution\nand what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just contradictory to what's already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government.\nSo I don't feel that's right at all\nIn that aspect.\n\nUm,\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue.\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that's it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd,\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion.\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything,\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don't know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on the society\nSociety than it would not.\n\n\nUmm,\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay, \n\nThe war in Iraq. Well, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, the two didn't have much to do with each other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. \n\nI am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. A tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that's horrible. They were taking out the country's government, and I don't think the American government was prepared for the aftermath, the void of power, and the chaos that would occur.\n\nThe United States is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold or implement democracy. The US government should have known that it would be a long and hard ordeal that probably wouldn't be a clear victory, like Vietnam.\n\n\nThere will always be insurgents, no matter how many people support the US, and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting a real army. You're fighting the citizens of the country. We shouldn't have gone to war in the first place, but if we did, we needed to plan for all possible outcomes. The government wasn't prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We're still there today, almost the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country, which will take a long time. The US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq.\n\nWe are naive for believing that because it takes time to implement a new form of government. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle, with tension and civil war. The US government made it seem easy. \n\nIt's a difficult decision because if we went in there, how can we abandon these people? \n\nWe took away their government and way of life. The consideration of the casualties and the cost of a free democratic Iraq is a huge issue. \n\nWhy is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this to other countries?\n\nThe oil issue is a big factor. Another reason for the war was that Iraq was believed to have weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. North Korea, which we know has weapons of mass destruction, isn't being attacked. \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace, but it probably won't.",

I always have been. \nUm, I really think it's a personal preference and uh...\nAnd it's something that's been proven more and more now that it could be biological as opposed to sociological, so to to give people less rights due to something that's really not any of their control.\nUm,\nDue to their control.\nI think it's kinda inhumane.\nAnd uh,\nI've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nUh, I don't think there's any...\nI think that politics and government in general shouldn't have a part in this it's it's...\nYou, it's not even at a state level it's a personal level it's a household level.\nUm,\nYou know my neighborhood at home there's I think two or three openly gay couples not...\nYou know not married or anything because they're not allowed to.\nUm,\nBut they they function the same way that any other family would.\nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that...\nUm,\nWith you know...\nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to.\nI think its...\nI think it's kind of ridiculous.\n\nSure yeah.\nI mean I think...\nI mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever, it's its something now that a chemical thing in your brain.\nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual.\nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it.\nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological.\n\nUm,\nWell other other than\nI guess the obvious it's you know in this...\nI think maybe cause marriage is something that...\nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know.\nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private sector type thing opposed to\nUm,\nAs opposed to public domain and um\nNational\nUm federal domain.\n\nUh no.\nNo.",
            "So, when you put something on the internet, it's public. It's completely public. You can't - I mean, as an RA, it's something I've actually had to deal with already. When you put something out there, it influences people's opinions of you. And if you're talking about blowing things up or if you're talking about shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there, put that into the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school and they have to act on that. They can't let it sit because then, God forbid something does happen, they could have prevented it. [Right]\n\nAgain, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a - for a sociology class. Sorry, couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they reported it. When we finally found out who the person was, they looked through a friend of his Facebook and got very worried because there were some things on there that he may have meant as a joke but in light of the situation became very serious.\n\nWhen you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking and going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it. And if there's danger they have to take it seriously.\n\nI mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs and if it's brought to their attention then it's something completely different.\n\nUm, yeah don't. Like a teacher should not make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just, it's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place so I don't even want that, that connection there. Um, not really.",
            "Um, I feel like the war has been drawn out far too long. I think the initial goal was good, namely to restore democracy in another country. But I think we have long since lost sight of that goal. And we are maybe just doing it out of principle, just to prove that we are some kind of superpower in the world. I also think that the original motives were questionable, having to do with the previous disputes of George Bush's father with Saddam Hussein. So, I think... I think if the original motivation was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, if there were any personal matters in it, I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it has dragged on too long. Um, I think we achieved our purpose in the first couple of months when we started the war, I think that was a statement in itself. But the fact that it has lasted for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too drawn out. \n\nUm, yeah, I think, um, I mean, if our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, then that's a just purpose, and that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think, I think our reason over time has deteriorated and been misunderstood. It seems like we're still at war for the sake of going to war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive end, a victory or something. \n\nUm, yeah, I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials are going to have to fend for themselves anyway, and I think that time has come. We have long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf, such as poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out. \n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are things obviously like poverty or internal improvements, you know, um, public roads or anything dealing with schools, we certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money’s being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for.\n\nI think that's it.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify this? Um, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was something like that. O okay. Um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if I mean, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace you know, you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile. You might need to, you know, be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum. Um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Oh let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything\". Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at peoples' profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile, or was someone just randomly looking at peoples' and just randomly happened to see that, or were they actually looking for, you know, some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So I don't really know.\n\nSure. Um, well, um, like, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know that there's creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on tv once that was about this. Um, this man who just, he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that. But I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like. Sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are. They pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know really who can look at what. So.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her, um, high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how, how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think, I don't really know, how they had the right to tell people. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\n\nYes.",
            "We only have this and then one more time that I need to talk about the Iraq War. I mean I feel hypocritical talking about it. I mean I hate to say you know, I hate to join the bandwagon of people that are like, oh I was against it from the beginning. Um, I was but like it’s not really important anymore. Cause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong. And um, I mean you just have to look at like the recent polls. They’ve done United States polls, they’ve done Iraqi polls, they’ve done global polls, and I mean no like about seventy five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea, eighty percent of Iraqis. Um, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. Um, I don’t know, it’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There’s really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore. Um, I mean I think it’s just, just the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations. And they think that they can just like bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist. Like that’s not the way that, um, this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean sure Saddam was a bad guy, I don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not, but I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to, you know, turn into just a complete disaster, just like quicksand from when we went over there. Um, I don’t even know what to say about it. Um, I don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there. Um, I mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there, um, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out. I don’t agree with them. I’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. Um, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that. But, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now. Um, I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people that we’re trying to save, like that we’re trying to help, telling us to leave. Um, you know I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens. You know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. Um, and then you know at least we’ll, I mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys. Kind of, not really, no. We’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it’ll be better than you know where we are, where we stand right now. Um, yeah, uh, no.",
            "I feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. And it's not just against women. I think it has to do with the specific field of work you are in. I mean, overall, I think women have it harder because of the glass ceiling. Even though equality is supposed to exist, most people have a hard time working under a woman if they are a man, just because of how society has been raised for so long. And so women often see a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically, women aren't usually seen in the upper echelons of the business world. And um, I guess the same thing goes for men, and for other industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. It's really uncommon to have a male parent staying at home, and a lot of times people look down on that because society thinks, \"Oh, well, you're the male, you should be out working, you should be the money maker of your family. Why are you staying at home?\" And it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down on that.  And then in the fashion industry, um a lot of times people won't really take males seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I guess it's because typically males who are into fashion, um, I guess have different lifestyles, and so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, wait, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for a woman? Like you don't really know what our situation is like like these other guys.\" And so depending on what field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and obviously, we have come a long way from the 1800s, leaps and bounds. But change is really slow, so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And just as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works,\" and um, and then for like fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff.\" And so they do know like where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them because if you force it people are going to resist. And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that, so I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way and change takes time. Yes, um, well I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself, like you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, and even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, so sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example, um, not really.",
            "Well, my understanding is that they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it.  Hmm, that took it down from a criminal offense to, uh, something like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. Um, and I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited for that, then you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would, I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge. One thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time there is an argument that, uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and to house them and then to let them go. And then it costs a lot, you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times and then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of uh, kind of thought track, then I think it’s totally fine. And I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it’s, it’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff. Um, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there’s this whole like financial element to it as well. Other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily, well, no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana. So, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what?  The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don’t really know, um, I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um, but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes because a lot of the things they do are very traditional, like they’ve done the same things for long periods of time, and it’s good to be rooted in tradition, but it’s also important to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and they’re very strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee and they don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics. They also don’t accept people of other religions. Like, for example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad’s religion. And that’s not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that’s a Catholic teaching, but it’s hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then Catholic practice goes against it because it’s so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don’t think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior, because it’s just a different realm. It might, but I probably don’t think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it’s a child which is different than a spouse. So if you’re going to do something like that, you’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married. Like, I don’t think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "Um, I haven't really made up my mind about this issue yet. So, I can't say if either side is right or wrong. But I believe that this is the trickiest topic we're facing today because something so close between separation of church and state and how to define marriage is something that is very hard to do without offending anyone.\n\nSo, I don't know, I think that... all civil unions... I don't know whether marriage should be looked at... and... how it should be defined by the government... Since it is a sacrament like considered... Well, people wouldn't get tax breaks... Or... looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized... And... so... If you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union... Because... that's what it is... It's two people... They shouldn't have separation of church and state... They shouldn't look into like well what kind of marriage was it... Two people got united... So... and... the fact that gay marriage... I mean... that would just... Oh, two people you got a civil union...\n\nUm... Well, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law. But... a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It is... something like the constitution shouldn't just be amended for something... I mean, it is a very big cause for certain people... But... it's not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment.\n\nIt's just not important enough to amend the constitution... to define... to ban gay marriage. Simply put...\n\nUh... No.",
            "Um, I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends. Um, I think I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, but I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I believe that it should be something that each state decides on its own, instead of, um, like, the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nUm, like a lot of states are democratic and, and a lot of states are republican. Obviously, democratic states are going to push for gay marriage, and, and if you're living in a democratic state, then you know, obviously, how that state feels about that position. And, and I don't think that you're necessarily in a position to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage, because you kind of chose to live there. You know, so I, like, I think, I don't, I think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already answered that, but, um, yeah, I don't feel as though, um, Bush should be allowed to, um, decide, um, um, that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the, um, individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nUm, I just, I just don't think, like, I don't think that, like, Bush doesn't live in every single state. So, he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to run, um, run itself, I guess, I don't know, um, so, I think that, um, some things should be left up to, um, each individual state. Plus, he's going to be out of office in like, what, two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, like, it's just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they're the ones that are going to have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.",
            "Um, no, I don't at all. Um, let's see. I figure Myspace is a public thing, and a bulletin board. You know, if you look at the definition, then you know, that's basically to post for the public to see or others to see, whatever you're trying to get at. And, if you post that on the internet, you know, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it be school officials or not. So, in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed it through their homes. Um, but yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here. Like, um, you know, if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking, smoking, or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble. And I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. But, um, I feel as though as long as they save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that?\n\nYeah, um, alright. Well, um, hmm, it's a lot easier to express yourself a lot longer when you're writing, but alright, well, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Um, everything, like, I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails. Um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up, and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and, you know, bites you in the butt I guess you could say. Um, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they will like find an email that you sent somehow, and like once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and, um, you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it; you will get in trouble. And I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy because, you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and, um, I don't know, let's see here.\n\n Um, like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them, or um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a, um, a teacher of mine. I went to a public high school, and um, they say you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff, and that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks. Uh, we had to be safe about that. We had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the well I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because um, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff um, in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case; they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. Uh, no, that's about it.",
            "Okay, so, at first I was all for the war because 9/11 affected me personally. I was for going over there and causing as much havoc as they did here. I think because it was such an emotional event, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan. And I really think that it backfired on us. Um, I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us too. Like, I don't think us being over there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. So, unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've almost just, I just don't care about what goes on over there with those people. I just don't care. I just think, I don't think they're human sometimes. I don't know, they fight with each other and they can't, they just can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care. Um, I don't know, we definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't know what we were going to face over there. Um, and it's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. They're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country. I just think they're looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. Um, we just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything. I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and, um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from. We really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say ok let's rebuild and that's it. So, um, I don't think we could have let it go. But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess, like creating order. And I don't know, I just think that they didn't, there was no like unity. They didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. So that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly, I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on definitely long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress. Like we've made progress, but not enough to stay in there. And I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just gonna collapse. And we can't stay over there forever. So I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No. Okay."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in some ways the Catholic Church does need to change its views.  A lot of people are talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it’s because the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of many things. \n\nFor example,  gay marriages, abortion, birth control.\n\nThe Catholic Church has very strong views on these things, which is fine. But I think their views are a little old-fashioned in some ways. So I think that if they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking they wouldn’t be worried about losing their following.\n\nI’ve heard that many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little because of the way they see these situations. And people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. So I feel they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things.\n\nI mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you are for abortion, you might not be comfortable in a following where that is taught to be completely wrong and that you are going against it.\n\nIt’s the same with gay marriage and things like that. If that was something you believed in and wanted to do or even just felt strongly about, you might not want to be in a following where they don’t agree with that.\n\nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or why priests can’t be married. But I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened. I mean, I don’t know. They might not have done that even if they were allowed to be married or if there were female priests. But I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it.\n\nWell, I mean, that was something they did, and that was something… I don’t know… That was something they did, and it didn’t really seem to be affected.\n\nI mean, if they were married, would they have done it differently? It’s hard to really tell.\n\nWell, I don’t see why priests can’t be married.\n\nI mean, the Catholic Church really says that priests are basically married to God and they devote their whole life to him. But I don’t see why everyone else who has a job in the world has their job and then they also have their family life and the other people they are devoted to, so I don’t see why priests can’t have both.",
            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage. I think whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not a conscious choice. So I think people, you know, gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. So I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't really.\n\nI haven't really thought a lot about the topic, but I would definitely say it's wrong for them to say that. It doesn't seem like a choice. Like they don't really have a choice on how they are, like I was born straight and another person is born gay, I guess. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held responsible for.\n\nI would definitely think it's wrong to do that. I don't really think the federal government should be involved because it's more of a... I don't think it's a legal issue. I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue. I mean, again, I don't think these gay people should be... how do I say... put on a stage like they're, you know, like it's wrong, like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever.\n\nSo I don't think the federal government really has any say.\n\nIt's hard.\n\n(laughs)\n\nOk, well, I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's, I mean, it's nothing involving the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that, it's not like... it just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interject in people's lives, and that's just who they are, the, who, who, you know, gay people, that's just like how they were born, or at least that's what I think, and I mean, they shouldn't be punished for that.\n\nUh no, that's it.",
            "**\nI think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's not really a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. There are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's the same thing. And there are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where, um, your primary or your, I don't want to say next of kin, because I'm not sure that that's what it is, but if you're in a gay couple then your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit, because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's kind of a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates. They have the same, um, factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's not involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation: separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that, and people worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community, and especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll, um, be influenced by their parent's, um, sexual orientation choices or not, but again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers and other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they, um, they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City, they get like beaten up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid. I mean, they're going to have the same points of view and everything. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples, and they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to. I mean, it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own, having to do with his religion. Well, his, um, his take on gay marriage actually, um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research, which, um, I think most of the reasons, I'm not sure about this because, honestly, I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality, I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and, um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account, to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about, um, under God in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and that the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood, not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is. And if people listened to, um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. \nIt's not as strict as it used to be. \nI know, even as I grew up when I was younger, I would always go to church every Sunday. \nAnd I would always wear cute little dresses. \nAnd matching shoes. \nAnd a matching purse. \nAnd that was just every single week. \nI went to a private school. \nAnd I would see all my friends there on the weekends. \nAnd we would just go. \nBut now that I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass. \nAnd they've cut it down to thirty minutes. \nAnd people dress a lot more casual. \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes, like straight from the beach. \nYou'd have the families there that are just running in late. \nSo I think it has become more casual. \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis. \nWell khakis are nice too. \nBut just a lot more casual in respect to that. \nAs for other things, that's the biggest thing that I noticed. \nLike that's the church I know. \nI don't know the politics into the church and what not. \nBut yeah, that's it.\n\n[OK, um regarding all of the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm, I don't think that these things could have been avoided. \nBecause there are married men \nAnd they still become pedophiles. \nAnd they still have \nUh, \nAn attraction towards young kids. \nSo I think even if you got them married it's just the person it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. \nUm, I think also when they're becoming a priest it's their choice to become a priest. \nUm, \nThere are religions that they're allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven. \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something. \n[Mm hmm]\nBut they're allowed to get married. \nSo I know it's a little different. \nBut, if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith. \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm, \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm, \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics. \nI think it's based on genetics. \nI don't think people \nUm \nJust become it. \nI think they're born that way. \nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up. \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case. \nBut \nI think it's their genetics. \nAnd you can't hide that through a marriage. \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out. \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them. \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew. \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUm no.",
            "(laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that's very much rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell\nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nAnd \nTo me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since. Well, since September 11th at least. I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm \nThat last part\n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell \nI do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq's sovereignty will come to be an issue. A major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I've heard, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That um \nOh, I can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what's happening, and even Mugtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess, it was less than a year ago, his party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we're still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm \n(laughs)\nNone that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I did\nMhm\nJust talk into it?\nOkay\nOkay, cool\nUm\nOkay, I'm sorry\nOkay\nHow I feel about the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point I feel it's kind of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S.\nLike who had done the terrorist attacks on nine eleven\nSo I don't feel like\nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq\nSo I don't like keep up with it\nI don't know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them\nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day\nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me see\nOhh this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh this hard\nUm\nMmm\nUhh I don’t know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOkay\nThank you\nUm\nWell um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair\nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore\nBut because I don’t think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn’t even call it\nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it never was declared a war by congress\nI think that’s how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it’s\nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them\nBut it’s also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like\nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like\nAnd what it’s doing to like\nCause remember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he’s like saying\nHe’ll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt’s like\nIt’s hard to say\nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it’s going to be even worse for them\nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them\nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know\nI feel like it’s gonna\nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat’s about it\nOkay",
            "Um\nI really don't feel comfortable with it,\nthinking it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as legal.\nI think it really comes down to the churches, because the constitution even says separation of church and state.\nIt's clear,\nIt's clear.\nUm\nIt is\nA clear thing and I feel that trying to do anything with it,\ntrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone in the constitution.\nSo,\nUm,\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another,\nBecause as we can see, most Catholics\nUm, Catholics and Christians are really against it\nand don't support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas.\nBut um,\nI don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal,\nand legal.\n\nUm,\nSeparation of church and state is pretty much\nUm, like been a key aspect of the constitution\nand what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just contradictory to what's already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government.\nSo I don't feel that's right at all\nIn that aspect.\n\nUm,\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue.\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that's it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd,\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion.\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything,\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don't know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on the society\nSociety than it would not.\n\n\nUmm,\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay, \n\nThe war in Iraq. Well, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, the two didn't have much to do with each other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. \n\nI am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. A tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that's horrible. They were taking out the country's government, and I don't think the American government was prepared for the aftermath, the void of power, and the chaos that would occur.\n\nThe United States is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold or implement democracy. The US government should have known that it would be a long and hard ordeal that probably wouldn't be a clear victory, like Vietnam.\n\n\nThere will always be insurgents, no matter how many people support the US, and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting a real army. You're fighting the citizens of the country. We shouldn't have gone to war in the first place, but if we did, we needed to plan for all possible outcomes. The government wasn't prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We're still there today, almost the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country, which will take a long time. The US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq.\n\nWe are naive for believing that because it takes time to implement a new form of government. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle, with tension and civil war. The US government made it seem easy. \n\nIt's a difficult decision because if we went in there, how can we abandon these people? \n\nWe took away their government and way of life. The consideration of the casualties and the cost of a free democratic Iraq is a huge issue. \n\nWhy is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this to other countries?\n\nThe oil issue is a big factor. Another reason for the war was that Iraq was believed to have weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. North Korea, which we know has weapons of mass destruction, isn't being attacked. \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace, but it probably won't.",

I always have been. \nUm, I really think it's a personal preference and uh...\nAnd it's something that's been proven more and more now that it could be biological as opposed to sociological, so to to give people less rights due to something that's really not any of their control.\nUm,\nDue to their control.\nI think it's kinda inhumane.\nAnd uh,\nI've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nUh, I don't think there's any...\nI think that politics and government in general shouldn't have a part in this it's it's...\nYou, it's not even at a state level it's a personal level it's a household level.\nUm,\nYou know my neighborhood at home there's I think two or three openly gay couples not...\nYou know not married or anything because they're not allowed to.\nUm,\nBut they they function the same way that any other family would.\nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that...\nUm,\nWith you know...\nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to.\nI think its...\nI think it's kind of ridiculous.\n\nSure yeah.\nI mean I think...\nI mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever, it's its something now that a chemical thing in your brain.\nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual.\nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it.\nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological.\n\nUm,\nWell other other than\nI guess the obvious it's you know in this...\nI think maybe cause marriage is something that...\nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know.\nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private sector type thing opposed to\nUm,\nAs opposed to public domain and um\nNational\nUm federal domain.\n\nUh no.\nNo.",
            "So, when you put something on the internet, it's public. It's completely public. You can't - I mean, as an RA, it's something I've actually had to deal with already. When you put something out there, it influences people's opinions of you. And if you're talking about blowing things up or if you're talking about shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there, put that into the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school and they have to act on that. They can't let it sit because then, God forbid something does happen, they could have prevented it. [Right]\n\nAgain, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a - for a sociology class. Sorry, couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they reported it. When we finally found out who the person was, they looked through a friend of his Facebook and got very worried because there were some things on there that he may have meant as a joke but in light of the situation became very serious.\n\nWhen you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking and going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it. And if there's danger they have to take it seriously.\n\nI mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs and if it's brought to their attention then it's something completely different.\n\nUm, yeah don't. Like a teacher should not make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just, it's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place so I don't even want that, that connection there. Um, not really.",
            "Um, I feel like the war has been drawn out far too long. I think the initial goal was good, namely to restore democracy in another country. But I think we have long since lost sight of that goal. And we are maybe just doing it out of principle, just to prove that we are some kind of superpower in the world. I also think that the original motives were questionable, having to do with the previous disputes of George Bush's father with Saddam Hussein. So, I think... I think if the original motivation was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, if there were any personal matters in it, I don't think it would have been fair. But I do think it has dragged on too long. Um, I think we achieved our purpose in the first couple of months when we started the war, I think that was a statement in itself. But the fact that it has lasted for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too drawn out. \n\nUm, yeah, I think, um, I mean, if our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, then that's a just purpose, and that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think, I think our reason over time has deteriorated and been misunderstood. It seems like we're still at war for the sake of going to war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive end, a victory or something. \n\nUm, yeah, I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials are going to have to fend for themselves anyway, and I think that time has come. We have long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf, such as poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out. \n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are things obviously like poverty or internal improvements, you know, um, public roads or anything dealing with schools, we certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money’s being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for.\n\nI think that's it.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify this? Um, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was something like that. O okay. Um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if I mean, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace you know, you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile. You might need to, you know, be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum. Um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Oh let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything\". Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at peoples' profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile, or was someone just randomly looking at peoples' and just randomly happened to see that, or were they actually looking for, you know, some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So I don't really know.\n\nSure. Um, well, um, like, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know that there's creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on tv once that was about this. Um, this man who just, he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that. But I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like. Sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are. They pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know really who can look at what. So.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her, um, high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how, how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think, I don't really know, how they had the right to tell people. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\n\nYes.",
            "We only have this and then one more time that I need to talk about the Iraq War. I mean I feel hypocritical talking about it. I mean I hate to say you know, I hate to join the bandwagon of people that are like, oh I was against it from the beginning. Um, I was but like it’s not really important anymore. Cause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong. And um, I mean you just have to look at like the recent polls. They’ve done United States polls, they’ve done Iraqi polls, they’ve done global polls, and I mean no like about seventy five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea, eighty percent of Iraqis. Um, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. Um, I don’t know, it’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There’s really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore. Um, I mean I think it’s just, just the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations. And they think that they can just like bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist. Like that’s not the way that, um, this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean sure Saddam was a bad guy, I don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not, but I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to, you know, turn into just a complete disaster, just like quicksand from when we went over there. Um, I don’t even know what to say about it. Um, I don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there. Um, I mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there, um, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out. I don’t agree with them. I’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. Um, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that. But, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now. Um, I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people that we’re trying to save, like that we’re trying to help, telling us to leave. Um, you know I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens. You know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. Um, and then you know at least we’ll, I mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys. Kind of, not really, no. We’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it’ll be better than you know where we are, where we stand right now. Um, yeah, uh, no.",
            "I feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. And it's not just against women. I think it has to do with the specific field of work you are in. I mean, overall, I think women have it harder because of the glass ceiling. Even though equality is supposed to exist, most people have a hard time working under a woman if they are a man, just because of how society has been raised for so long. And so women often see a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically, women aren't usually seen in the upper echelons of the business world. And um, I guess the same thing goes for men, and for other industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. It's really uncommon to have a male parent staying at home, and a lot of times people look down on that because society thinks, \"Oh, well, you're the male, you should be out working, you should be the money maker of your family. Why are you staying at home?\" And it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down on that.  And then in the fashion industry, um a lot of times people won't really take males seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I guess it's because typically males who are into fashion, um, I guess have different lifestyles, and so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, wait, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for a woman? Like you don't really know what our situation is like like these other guys.\" And so depending on what field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and obviously, we have come a long way from the 1800s, leaps and bounds. But change is really slow, so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And just as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works,\" and um, and then for like fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff.\" And so they do know like where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them because if you force it people are going to resist. And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that, so I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way and change takes time. Yes, um, well I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself, like you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, and even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, so sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example, um, not really.",
            "Well, my understanding is that they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it.  Hmm, that took it down from a criminal offense to, uh, something like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. Um, and I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited for that, then you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would, I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge. One thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time there is an argument that, uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and to house them and then to let them go. And then it costs a lot, you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times and then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of uh, kind of thought track, then I think it’s totally fine. And I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it’s, it’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff. Um, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there’s this whole like financial element to it as well. Other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily, well, no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana. So, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what?  The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don’t really know, um, I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um, but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",
            "I would say yes because a lot of the things they do are very traditional, like they’ve done the same things for long periods of time, and it’s good to be rooted in tradition, but it’s also important to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and they’re very strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee and they don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics. They also don’t accept people of other religions. Like, for example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad’s religion. And that’s not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that’s a Catholic teaching, but it’s hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then Catholic practice goes against it because it’s so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don’t think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior, because it’s just a different realm. It might, but I probably don’t think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it’s a child which is different than a spouse. So if you’re going to do something like that, you’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married. Like, I don’t think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "Um, I haven't really made up my mind about this issue yet. So, I can't say if either side is right or wrong. But I believe that this is the trickiest topic we're facing today because something so close between separation of church and state and how to define marriage is something that is very hard to do without offending anyone.\n\nSo, I don't know, I think that... all civil unions... I don't know whether marriage should be looked at... and... how it should be defined by the government... Since it is a sacrament like considered... Well, people wouldn't get tax breaks... Or... looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized... And... so... If you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union... Because... that's what it is... It's two people... They shouldn't have separation of church and state... They shouldn't look into like well what kind of marriage was it... Two people got united... So... and... the fact that gay marriage... I mean... that would just... Oh, two people you got a civil union...\n\nUm... Well, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law. But... a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It is... something like the constitution shouldn't just be amended for something... I mean, it is a very big cause for certain people... But... it's not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment.\n\nIt's just not important enough to amend the constitution... to define... to ban gay marriage. Simply put...\n\nUh... No.",
            "Um, I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends. Um, I think I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, but I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I believe that it should be something that each state decides on its own, instead of, um, like, the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nUm, like a lot of states are democratic and, and a lot of states are republican. Obviously, democratic states are going to push for gay marriage, and, and if you're living in a democratic state, then you know, obviously, how that state feels about that position. And, and I don't think that you're necessarily in a position to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage, because you kind of chose to live there. You know, so I, like, I think, I don't, I think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already answered that, but, um, yeah, I don't feel as though, um, Bush should be allowed to, um, decide, um, um, that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the, um, individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nUm, I just, I just don't think, like, I don't think that, like, Bush doesn't live in every single state. So, he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to run, um, run itself, I guess, I don't know, um, so, I think that, um, some things should be left up to, um, each individual state. Plus, he's going to be out of office in like, what, two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, like, it's just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they're the ones that are going to have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.",
            "Um, no, I don't at all. Um, let's see. I figure Myspace is a public thing, and a bulletin board. You know, if you look at the definition, then you know, that's basically to post for the public to see or others to see, whatever you're trying to get at. And, if you post that on the internet, you know, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it be school officials or not. So, in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed it through their homes. Um, but yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here. Like, um, you know, if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking, smoking, or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble. And I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. But, um, I feel as though as long as they save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that?\n\nYeah, um, alright. Well, um, hmm, it's a lot easier to express yourself a lot longer when you're writing, but alright, well, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Um, everything, like, I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails. Um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up, and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and, you know, bites you in the butt I guess you could say. Um, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they will like find an email that you sent somehow, and like once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and, um, you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it; you will get in trouble. And I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy because, you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and, um, I don't know, let's see here.\n\n Um, like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them, or um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a, um, a teacher of mine. I went to a public high school, and um, they say you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff, and that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks. Uh, we had to be safe about that. We had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the well I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because um, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff um, in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case; they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. Uh, no, that's about it.",
            "Okay, so, at first I was all for the war because 9/11 affected me personally. I was for going over there and causing as much havoc as they did here. I think because it was such an emotional event, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan. And I really think that it backfired on us. Um, I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us too. Like, I don't think us being over there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. So, unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've almost just, I just don't care about what goes on over there with those people. I just don't care. I just think, I don't think they're human sometimes. I don't know, they fight with each other and they can't, they just can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care. Um, I don't know, we definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't know what we were going to face over there. Um, and it's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. They're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country. I just think they're looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. Um, we just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything. I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and, um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from. We really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say ok let's rebuild and that's it. So, um, I don't think we could have let it go. But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess, like creating order. And I don't know, I just think that they didn't, there was no like unity. They didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. So that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly, I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on definitely long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress. Like we've made progress, but not enough to stay in there. And I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just gonna collapse. And we can't stay over there forever. So I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No. Okay."
