            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city is a real melting pot, you know? It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle with all these different pieces fitting together in a crazy way.  Living here is like being on a never-ending adventure. You've got your residential pockets scattered all over the place, tucked in between shops and restaurants and offices.  It's like a feast for the senses, with new places popping up all the time. \n\nWe've got those big, fancy stores that everyone knows, but then there are these hidden gems, these little boutiques that just make you want to pop in. They're everywhere, even on quiet streets you wouldn't expect, adding a touch of magic to the everyday.  And don't even get me started on the parks! They're always filled with families, kids running around, having fun. It's heartwarming to see. \n\nSpeaking of diverse, this place is bursting with different cultures.  Right here in my neighborhood, you've got your LGBTQ+ folks, a tight-knit Orthodox Jewish community, and even folks who have made their way here from the old Soviet Union. It's like a little world within a world.  \n\nAnd if you venture a little further out, you'll find even more communities, like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia... they're all just a stone's throw away, but sometimes getting there feels like a journey. Traffic can be a nightmare, especially during rush hour.  You can drive for miles and miles, but it might only take you a few blocks.\n\nIt's funny, though, because even with all this traffic, everyone seems to be adding more buildings to the city.  New apartment blocks are springing up everywhere, but some people are starting to worry that it's getting too crowded.\n\nBut hey, there's something for everyone here. You've got your big apartment buildings, your cozy houses, even duplexes.  It's all mixed up, just like the people who live here.\n\nI've lived here my whole life, but I still feel like I'm constantly meeting new people.  It's not exactly a tight-knit community anymore, but that's okay. It's still exciting, always something new to discover. Maybe that's the beauty of city life, always keeping you on your toes.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a quirky little slice of America, ya know? Most of the houses are like those classic single-family ones, but some folks split 'em up, making two homes out of one, still attached like twins. My place has got a little patch of grass out front and a teeny driveway, just enough for one car. It's like a picture postcard from a bygone era, back when the American dream meant living in the suburbs.  Back then, it felt like everyone was chasing that dream, but now, it's like the dream's drifting away, getting harder to hold onto. \n\nBut my neighborhood, it's still holding strong, whispering that the dream's still out there, just gotta keep reachin' for it. Folks ain't as hopeful as they used to be, the lawns ain't as manicured, but you still see a couple cars in most driveways, and the kids, they're running wild, like the world's their playground. There's this old school, been around for nigh on 90 years, still standing tall, givin' kids a glimpse of the future, while the old folks reminisce about their own school days. Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts? Packed! All the houses look different, but they all feel the same, like they're part of the same story.\n\nWe got this big supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by this big, friendly Yemeni family, they're probably the only Arab folks around here. Most folks are African American, generations deep, with stories about when everyone knew everyone.\n\nThere used to be a karate school, but when those Karate Kid movies went outta style, kids lost interest, so now it's a pharmacy. Guess they figured pills were the new kung fu, huh? Then there's this tiny movie theater, showing oldies for cheap.  Too old-fashioned for the young folks, but the older folks love it, a night out without all the hustle and bustle.\n\nWe got this expressway runnin' through town, but the on and off ramps are just outside our borders. Tried to get an exit, young folks wanted it, but the old-timers said it'd ruin our town. They got their way, kept things just the way they were. Now they're buildin' a new high school, and we're tryin' to pick a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a Southern drawl and a log cabin would sum up our town pretty good.",
            "Hmm...you might just miss it at first glance, this little corner tucked behind the shops. Not the kinda place you'd think folks would want to call home, not at first. But pry past the old, dusty Whole Foods and past the hotels that mostly sit empty, save for a few family get-togethers in the summer, and you'll stumble onto a whole world buzzing with life.  It's like a secret society, these streets and these apartment complexes huddled together like a bunch of Russian nesting dolls, all taken apart and laid out in a line.  You'll see some complexes that've been in the news for some not-so-nice stuff, so let's not dwell on those, yeah? Appearances can be deceiving. But the ones next to those, the ones beside those, those are a whole other story, a world most folks around here never even know about.\n\nJust across from those complexes, you've got this community college, a little branch campus. Quiet as a mouse, it is, with students shuffling in, coffee in hand, yawning like it's the end of the world at seven in the morning. The iron gates creak open for them one by one, while folks rushing to work shake their fists and grumble about them slowing things down on busy days. The road just kinda forks off into another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehab center for folks who've had a few… mishaps. The rehab center's got these cheerful porch chairs and a ceiling fan that goes round and round, pushing the thick summer air back and forth.\n\nKids are running around in the park, cartwheeling and spinning like crazy in the grass, while bees buzz around the flowers by the road. Old folks walk their dogs, grumbling at the teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the girls gossiping by the playground, talking about boys and YouTube videos. There's a sushi place in a strip mall by the park, cheap eats but never too crowded. Right beside that's a swimming supply store, and tucked in between them is a nail salon. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat hibachi chicken all at once. That's the magic of a strip mall, you know?\n\nAnd there's a frozen yogurt place there too, the kind where you build your own concoction. You see the kids from the park all the time, holding their cold, dripping cups of yogurt, doing skateboard tricks and puffing away on vapes because they think it makes them look cool.\n\nThis whole neighborhood is a slice of America, a little piece of history frozen in time down here in the sleepy south, where not even time itself seems to rush.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the endless cornfields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she wouldn't believe how simple and open everything was. She was used to living in a town where everything was just a short walk away, she'd never seen this much space in her life. Overwhelmed by all the corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we continued down this two-lane country road, we came to a quarry filled with water. Just past it was the little development where I live. The houses are mostly built with brick and stucco, and each one has at least half an acre of land that everyone takes pride in keeping up. In the springtime, there are flowers everywhere, along with the Midwestern trees that change color with each season.  All the driveways are filled with fancy Mercedes Benz cars that gleam in the sunlight after a good wash.\n\nDriving further down the road towards my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly smile. He spends the whole day mowing his lawn and you can hear him singing over the sound of the mower. Everyone in the neighborhood thinks it's funny, but he's such a good guy with a really interesting story. He's getting older now and isn't quite as sharp as he used to be. Back in the day, he was a doctor, and now he blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese roam around and are chased by our terrier. In the back, there's a little stream that flows into the quarry.  Here you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and sometimes even a \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge is a peaceful oasis filled with trees, herbs, and wildflowers that grow naturally. This is where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to chasing animals (mostly just chasing them!), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood friend to play with.\n\nThe winters in my small town can be really tough, but they're also beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green to a bare wilderness. The trees that were once covered in colorful flowers become bare skeletons of bark. When it snows, which it does sometimes, everything turns into a winter wonderland overnight. The backyard is filled with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I used to fight a lot when we were kids, and in the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We'd build huge igloo-like forts to store our weapons, usually sticks and branches, like we were in a secret army. In our own little winter wonderland, we played pretend and forgot about everything else. We were just kids, free and happy.",
            "Hmm...let me tell you about Portland, Oregon, this place with a unique kind of \"weirdness\". You'll see it everywhere, even on the side of a building that's part pizza joint, part bar, part music venue, part strip club...you get the picture.  They say \"Keep Portland Weird\" there, like it's a promise.  Some folks, they remember the old Portland, back when it was still hidden away and affordable. That's the Portland that birthed all the creative, quirky subcultures. Others, well, they see it as an invitation - come to Portland, where being different is a good thing, something to celebrate.  Even with all those fancy Californians moving in and those shiny new condos popping up everywhere, Portland still holds onto that weirdness.\n\nBut what exactly does \"weird\" mean here? It's not about being totally accepting of everything, no. It's about accepting the things that might make others raise an eyebrow. It's about knowing that we still have all the modern conveniences and the same everyday struggles as anywhere else. Sure, we buy most of our stuff from China, just like everyone else. There are a million ways to be different, to not fit in, and Portland has plenty of those. \n\nYou'll find yoga studios, hipsters, and suits working in offices here, just like anywhere else. Maybe \"weird\" just means we take it all a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, and in lots of others, you'll see houses painted in all sorts of bright colors, gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and even free boxes lining the sidewalks. These boxes, well, they're a Portland tradition. They're filled with treasures - clothes, books, sometimes even something completely unexpected. It's like a little surprise waiting for you around every corner.  \n\nThat magical feeling of discovering something special in the most ordinary places, that's what Portland is all about to me. At least, that's my version of weird. I know there are thousands of other kinds of weird here. Some folks wouldn't dream of taking anything out of a box on the street. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yes, you read that right!) or cheer on the Timbers soccer team. Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things, dream big, or at least dream about dreaming big while sipping a pint at the local pub. \n\nWe're not perfect, though. Like anywhere else, we have our struggles. Portland has a drug problem, and it's hard not to see the connection between that and the mental health issues that often go hand in hand. The constant rain and gray skies probably don't help either. And then there's the issue of homelessness, a problem that seems to plague every city. Portland tries to help, but our programs aren't enough.  Some people here are compassionate, while others just give up hope. Honestly, that's not so weird, is it? It's just part of being human.",
            "The mountains, they've always been there, like silent guardians watching over everything. Northward, they stand tall, witnessing every sunrise and sunset, unmoved by the hustle and bustle of life. Even when I'm caught up in my studies or work, they're still there, solid and unwavering. On days when stress weighs heavy on me, they seem to call out, demanding to be seen. And when I turn to them, they offer a calming presence, a source of strength to carry on, one day at a time.\n\nIt all started when I first moved here for university. The mountains north of campus captured my heart immediately. The university itself has its own beauty – the buildings, the ponds, the trees – each holding a special place in my memory. But the mountains, they rule them all.  \n\nThe town itself is a charming mix of the familiar and the unexpected. There are countless cafes where I spent countless hours fueled by coffee and late-night study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where faded brick buildings whisper stories of a bygone era. It's here that the town pulses with a vibrant energy, almost as if it's trying to outshine its bustling city neighbor. But just a few blocks away, you can escape back to the peaceful charm of small-town life, passing by the library on your way. This beautiful contrast, this close proximity of two distinct atmospheres, gives the town a magical quality, inviting you to explore its every nook and cranny.\n\nIt's a town where memories are made, both cherished and bittersweet. There's the rusty swing set in the park, where friends and I would congregate after all-nighters, or the frantic dash through the downtown area to catch a movie at the fancy theater thanks to a student discount. But like all places, it holds its share of painful memories too. The ponds, especially, seem to be a magnet for introspection and tearful confessions at 2 a.m. during existential crises – an experience I've had more times than I care to admit.\n\nWhile watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each with their own purpose, I couldn't help but question my own path. I walked past the pond, the park, the houses that screamed suburbia, until I found myself on a main street. As I walked, the sun bathed the palm trees in its golden light, painting the sky with vibrant hues. Looking up, I realized I was heading north. And there they were, as steadfast as ever. The mountains, majestically towering above everything else, their presence a silent reminder of my own strength and perseverance.",
            "My, oh my, if you ever find yourself planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it!  Getting around is a breeze, especially with the awesome public transportation, you know, one of the big things in New York City.  Bensonhurst has a real city vibe, so you'll be smack-dab in the heart of it all.  \n\nAnd speaking of vibes, get ready for a real sensory experience! You'll see these amazing Asian stores everywhere you look. In the last twenty years or so, Bensonhurst has become a real melting pot, especially with all the Asian folks moving in.  It's like every block has an Asian-owned store, you'll be spoiled for choice! Supermarkets and laundromats seem to be the most popular, and they're a hit with everyone, not just the Asian community. The food in the supermarkets is top-notch, the prices are super reasonable, and let's be honest, it's just so darn convenient. I mean, I live right near a cluster of four Asian supermarkets, all within a couple of minutes walking distance! Talk about convenience!\n\nBut don't think Bensonhurst is all about one culture, oh no! It's a real mix of people, with immigrants, and their kids who are first and second generation Americans, all living together.  While most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, there's a cool new park nearby that's got something for everyone. Ten basketball courts, a huge field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for the little ones, even a water fountain to cool off in the summer. It's a true melting pot, with people from all walks of life hanging out and getting along.\n\nAs for buildings, you won't find too many big, corporate towers here. Mostly, it's co-op buildings and condos. The majority of peeps live in these cute two-family houses, though.  The people here are generally nice, but can be a bit noisy, if you catch my drift.  Cars blasting music as they drive by,  people revving their engines in the morning...it can wake you right up! If you're planning to be out at night, keep your wits about you.  Bensonhurst is pretty safe, but you never know when you might run into some troublemakers, bullies, or even thieves. I've been through some things here myself, a few run-ins in the past, nothing too bad, but it's good to be aware. \n\nAnother thing, there's been a bit of a package theft problem lately.  Not a good look, right?  And while New York City has rules about cleaning up after your dog, some folks don't seem to get the memo.  Every morning, you'll probably see at least one piece of dog waste on your way to the train or the supermarket.  It's a real pet peeve of mine, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood is a peculiar place, perched precariously on the highest hill in town. People call it the \"workout hill\" because all the runners love to challenge themselves with its steep incline. The lack of sidewalks forces everyone to walk on the road, which is cracked and uneven in spots, making it a bit of a bumpy ride. The power lines strung across the street tell a story of their own, tattered and patched together after countless encounters with falling branches and storms.  \n\nEverywhere you look, towering evergreen trees stand sentinel.  But here's the funny thing - folks around here despise them! They're always trying to chop them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are built high up on the hill, with giant second stories boasting glass walls, desperately trying to catch a glimpse of the bay.\n\nSunsets are breathtaking, though. The water shimmers like liquid gold, and the sky explodes in a blaze of orange. Most days, though, the clouds steal the show, shrouding everything in a soft, damp haze. Moss thrives in this dampness, clinging to roofs, cars, even railings. Once, I left my car parked for a month, and it emerged looking like a furry green monster - three hours of scrubbing later, it was finally clean.\n\nKids are a rare sight in our neighborhood.  There's a school just a few blocks away, but it's mostly populated by retired folks.  Dogs, on the other hand, are everywhere. You'll find them lounging on lawns, chasing each other down the street, or sometimes, even sneaking into your house if you leave a door open!  I once found one in my living room, patiently waiting for a treat.\n\nRabbits also roam freely, much to the annoyance of gardeners who find their burrows digging up precious plants. But my cats are thrilled, having hunted most of them out of our yard.  We also have our fair share of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle, who often get chased away by the resident crows.\n\nThere aren't any stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood.  The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can easily see the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "Hmm... life here is kinda like one of those slow-moving movies, you know?  I live on this little street in a sleepy town down south, kinda tucked between two busy highways.  So, we get our fair share of traffic, nothin' too wild though. It's a pretty quiet neighborhood, most folks here have lived here for ages, so we all know each other pretty well.  It's the kind of place where everyone's busy with their own thing - tending to their yards, running errands, that kinda stuff.   \n\nWe live on the corner, so we get a front-row seat to all the neighborhood action. We know all the cars that go by, and if somethin' new rolls up, well, we take notice.  Some folks like to take walks, others walk their dogs, and the kids, they're always whizzing around on their bikes.  \n\nMy wife and I work from home, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen, are always underfoot. We're pretty much homebodies, so everyone's used to seeing us come and go. We love to play outside, even when it's drizzling, and we'll fire up the grill on our back deck whenever we get the chance.  It's like an unspoken rule - you gotta smell that barbecue at least once a week! \n\nThere's nothin' but trees around here, it used to be all woods, so we've got plenty of shade, but that means a whole lot of leaves come Fall. Raking and burning leaves is practically a family tradition. That smoky smell just screams \"Autumn\" to me, you know?\n\nThis year, we haven't had much of a winter at all, just a long, drawn-out Fall.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we only use the front door for company, which isn't often.\n\nI like to tinker in the garage with my truck or other projects, and when the doors are open, I feel like I'm more connected to the whole neighborhood. Holidays are a little more lively - Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas - folks come visit and the street gets crowded with cars.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty good life here.  If it weren't for that through-street traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where it's dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably don't get it. Like, you just don't understand the feeling of seeing brown everywhere you look. And when you do see a lawn, you know that person is dropping serious cash on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first lived here, the houses were spread out like they were trying to escape each other. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a bunch of new places popping up. Honestly, it's starting to feel more like a city every day, but I guess that's happening everywhere, right?\n\nMost of the people here are really friendly, just like in any place, you have your ups and downs. But in my part of town, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so it's a pretty nice place to be.\n\nThe stores around here are mostly the chain kind, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for something upscale, you gotta drive a bit. Never see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here. \n\nBased on what I see, the biggest industry in town is construction. I think that's because the city is still growing. There are still tons of wide-open spaces waiting to be built on.  It kinda freaks me out, actually. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city, and I'm not looking to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living – drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nOne of the things I love about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert itself is definitely a big draw. The high desert climate and landscape have created some pretty amazing ecosystems that need protecting. We share this space with all sorts of awesome creatures, and it's important that we learn about them so we can live together peacefully.\n\nMy family and I have gotten pretty good at coexisting with the wildlife. I have three kids, and they're obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. They're out there right now, trying to catch all sorts of interesting critters.\n\nAs for things to do around here, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert in a different way.  If you're visiting, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a ton of fun, and it really captures the Victorville spirit.  \n\nYou can also head up to nearby Wrightwood to see the snowy mountains and even take a winter sports lesson. \n\nIf you're interested in learning about the history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit. They have all sorts of cool stuff – geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how Victorville came to be.",
            "Hmm...my heart n soui went to Taiwan last Thursday,on the 1st to be precise. Im going to miss him and it has only been a day and yet here I am looking at his photo... again and again as if the world is going to come tumbling down.  Yup...his job is kinda time constraining,him an officer in the army ... I have to live with that for the rest of my life. Yet, I am happy with him. There's chemistry and we could talk about anything from weapons,politics or even the simple terminology of self reflection. I feel safe with him...maybe he is my knight n shinning armour who  has come to save me amidst the confusion. He was so sweet,the day he called me before he flew off, he said ' In any decision that you are going to make, I will say yes to it all,I wiil support you and at the end of the day, I will always be there for you,' I almost cried when he said that, Ive been waiting for someone to tell me that.  Dear Khai,my knight and shinning armour, come back to me when your job is done...   Untukmu Khai  Untukmu Ku saluti benang-benang sutera, menjadi perhiasan setiap pereka, menjadi keinginan si dara jelita, menjadi rebutan si putera raja... Setiap lirikan mata, Setiap gerak geri bicara, Ku perkemaskan tenunan, Ku halusi perasaan, Lalu,dengan perlahan redup matamu ku perhatikan, Lalu aku relakan... mereka istana pasir, dari embun-embun kasih.  - 3.4.2004                  tired...the whole day in school was spend in meetings. A friend of mine sms me saying that he had just came back from a short getaway. At first I was so relieved that he message me...then again. Believing in your feelings can really be difficult...especially when the other party does not feel the same way.To cross a friends path thats another issue...hmm,did some surfing on the net,discovered some beautiful poems.  This poem captured my heart,it goes on like this,  A Dream within a Dream by Edgar Allen Poe   Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem That my days have been a dream; Yet, if Hope has flown away In a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it, therefore, the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.  I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?  Been thinking of a certain someone that I really like...once upon a time. When everything was so  colourful, the air was sweet, the trees were beautiful...hmm.Thinking that it was meant to last forever n ever. Indeed, it only existed in fairy tales.True enough.                 Yesterday, the 4 of us went to Bukit Batok, me, my sis, ayu n hanip. We went to meet Keris, they were feeling kinda of down. Pity them. After that, we went and have a drink at Mas Ayu wif the other Kelana guys. Hmm...ayu cracking jokes about Talib, all the way from Bukit Batok to Mas Ayu. We were out control...giggling and laughing our hearts out throughout the journey. Irony.  I woke up late this morning. Marking my karangan...the neverending ordeal. After this, Im suppose to meet my P6EM3. I just realise how happy I am. although Im shoudering a lot of responsibilities.   The other day, my sis saw Khai, presuming with his wife. Hmm...life, what can I say. Yet, the bigger picture is, trust, guys and marriage. Marriage is a huge responsibility... a commitment. Nevertheless, when to think of it back, everything make sense. Maybe, it was a good thing in getting to know him, yup...he hurt me, but if we were to look at it at another perspective, he had hurt his partner even more, the trust. Me, being the third party. Retribution, I do not want to see it coming. I love my dear Hanip so much. Even to think of it, will make me sick. Then again, if it is meant to be...then be it. In life we have to be strong in tackling problem. It can be him and it can be me. He told me,  feelings can change, which is terribly true.     2.55 pm   Just finish cutting the tickets, the alignment has gone haywired. Ismail has been bugging me on the tickets. Hmm...Im searching for the C.C chop, I misplaced it , somehow. Im tired. My eyes are tired. Im tired. Ismail asked me whether they can use the mirror room. I try to see what I can do.    5.55 pm  Hmm...at de spur of moments, things can change. Now, Im feeling restless. Sad.   ' Which is one is better, 3 years or one n a half year...'  I think it is better if it is 3 years, then I won't be leaving in denial.  An everlasting commitment... ' the person can be me or you...' it can be Me or you...  &nbsp;     Kris Dayanti & Ajai          After reading my previous post, it lead me to think, saya ni orangnya berjiwang-jiwang. Hmm...enough of that sweetness in the air, the cloud nine, the everlasting cotton wool and being dragged back to the ground. Yesterday was the MAEC meeting, yup...we are going to have the gigantic group around...its not confimed yet but then again the glitters that we see in their eyes...can outshine the indoor stadium,hmm,im just exaggerating huh..     My sis and I decided to stay on because of these words...' We wont be in the CC, without you guys around,' hmm...so touched by what my dear bro Ayu had to say. And again we decided to stay on because of our dear ...Mr Zahidi Rahman, our supportive chairman. He actually begged us to stay. Thus,this year the first project is sponsored by the Heritage Centre with the help of us the MAEC.  Yup...the outlining of the budget, the Arts, and the most important thing the objective. For Mega Perdana...I don't really care. Mega Perdana had already been auction for the mere of $5,000. The so called Chairman is responsible for this.   Therefore, Singapore expect the next ala Gentarasa or even a bigger event to be truly organised by MAEC Siglap South and the Giants... Yesterday, Rizal called, he told me to write lyrics for the group. The theme, hmmm...something to do with Paruh... belum berilham hamba...  13 days to go, Khai. : )   'Love is not a matter of counting the years... it's making the years count.  --Wolfman Jack Smith                 yesterday was a very tiring and long day...woke up late to school. Hmm...had our Malam Anugerah Dikir 2004 penilaian...everyone was there.The emotional part was seeing them,the so called ' orang lama of the dikir barat world ' together after long years apart. Today,got an email... procedures on the registration to enrol on a degree programme in UM .still thinking,got the green light from my family.hmm...maybe I should enrol,there's nothing much left for me here,macam sedih gitukan... My friend told me, have you ever heard of the story about the Science teacher and her jar, the science teacher,put a few golf ball inside the jar,still its not full,the she put in some pebbles,followed by sand and the water. Then she said, in life we have to priorities,who are the golf balls,who symbolizes the sands and so on and so forth.The golf balls are people that are dear to you,people who meant a lot to you,the sand and the water symbolizes the so not important people,those that you can live without.Look here she said,you have to put the golf balls first,not the sand or the water.If you were to put the water first,you cannot put your golf balls...put the golfballs,then the pebbles,then the sand...then the water,you have to know. True...my families are my golf balls...the people that are dear to you.A friend told me that I kept making these stupid mistakes due to the fact that Im lonely, ehheheeh..more of a pathetic twisted personality. Now,Im a bit focus,confident tak tau asal...mungkin dah penat...mungkin. Adakah yang benar itu benar...tidak benar.                    Im hurting again...that's the irony part,I don't know why I am feeling this way. I can feel my heart bleeding thou...its happening again.Yup...as if a knife,slowly piercing deep through me. Yesterday, I went out with him and he brought up the issue of one of the gerl's group. I was so pissed off... yup... I totally lose control and the worse part, it was only like  30%  of my anger... bursting...it was not a full blast,then again.. it did make an impact.I kind of settled in when he crack some jokes about the boriah tingy...hmm,he is sweet...very sweet.  Guess what...7 new messages.Hmm...so many people I've blocked from my msn.Missed chatting with Shariffah aka yan, been busy lately...hmmm...  Again, let us analyse what the hell am I suffering from...is it an infectious or contagious disease...heheheeh, maybe I need to rest for another month or was it a pure act of jealousy..nah,that would be the last thing.... then again, maybe if you love the person too much, I would just like to imagine him being wrapped up neatly,in a package,put it in my closet,far away from all the girls as possible.At one point,I tend to become restless,twitchy and uneasy when he mentioned to me about his x.Im not a paranoid.To look at my past, I do have loads of Xs but then was then. Perhaps,Ive never been ditch before.The feeling must be overwhelming.Hmm...sad to say this,I think he still loves his x...that's it!! I couldn't sleep because I think he has feelings for his x. I feel terrible now...inferiority lurkes again. What a jughead, how can I not see this.. thats why I am feeling miserable..it has nothing to do with that masked man... Shucks...hmmm...jiwa retak pulak saya ni... Hai...how love can makes you a desperado and defy the norms.merepeknyelah saya...: ) Im listening to... Ada Apa Dengan Cinta...apa nak jadi hafidah,yeah...away feminisme and what is left of it...                     Guess what...a fren of mine by the name of Zai called, he hated when I call him that, the kelkatu man.heheeh,hmm...he sounded suprise. He asked me, ' Do you know that .....in your CC,' I said ' Yeah,Ive discussed it with Ayu,' The matter of the fact was, I dont really care...I mean the C.C stuff and more...Im in cloud nine you see and the only thing I can think off when Im marking and stuff like that is to think about my dear Khai in Taiwan.Has he eaten,taken his bath or the most important thing does he look at the stars every night and think of me, like I think of him.ehehhe.    The irony part here, is that Ive known him...what like nearly two months perhaps and the impact he gave me.I have to admit, the first time I met him,it was a mutual thing, a fren thing, like I meet my other frens. Then goes on to the next meeting plus the hours we hang on the phone.hmm...kita boleh bergayut berjam-jam.  Seldom people can just have the same chemistry bonding with me and the one that I want to be with is not just any Tom, Dick or Harry, he must be confident but at the same time humble... Any Tom, Dick or Harry can be found anywhere,under the drain,clubhouses,brushing their ego or just looking at themselves in the mirror and telling it straight to their face that they are big time losers.   Being in a relationship is not just uttering a few words like  I love you  or  I want you  , being true to each other,and to truly feel at lost when the other party is not around. Nevertheless,his picture or his last words somehow cure the emptiness inside.  I don't understand on how sometimes relationship is build on  a stupid lie. To be truthful is a responsibility to the loved ones.When you commit to someone, you don't only give your words...its more than that.     Something to digest ....Les Brown - I believe there are three kinds of people. There are winners, who know what they want and understand their potential and the possibilities. They take life on. Next are losers, who don't have a clue as to who they are. They allow circumstances to shape their lives and their self-image. I believe there is a third group as well. This consists of potential winners whose lives are just slightly out of alignment. I call them wayward winners...",
            "Hmm...my heart's been in Stockbridge for about 10 years now.  When I first got here from Riverdale, I'll admit, I had a good cry. Missing my old family and friends really hit me hard.  But my parents, they wanted the best for me and my little sister. A better place to live, a better school...you know, like they always say, \"a step up from the ghetto.\"  I guess over time, I got used to it all. Made some new friends, some people who just rubbed me the wrong way. I never really got close to the neighbors though, except for Mr. Glen and his kids.  And Dennis for a little while. They're like family to me, I'm really grateful for them.\n\nRemember that time we went to Mr. Glen's wedding?  He and Ms. Veda tied the knot again. It was a blast!  I caught the little white strap she took off her leg, but I missed the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I had a real good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing great!\n\nThis neighborhood can be a bit of a puzzle, but with my GPS, I'm exploring more. Mostly, I hang out with my buddies Kason and Curtis.  We used to be glued to the video games, just living it up. Sometimes I'd head to the park, just to soak up some nature. It really calms me down.  Makes me feel at peace. I might bring some sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, maybe even my bokken if I can. It's just fun to do the things I love.  \n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court there too, even though I haven't touched a racket or a ball in ages.  Still nice to have around, you know, just in case I feel like playing again. My dad and Mr. Graves, they really got me and my best friend hooked on tennis back in the day. We had a blast! They pushed us hard, but it was always fun.\n\nThere are so many good times here, so many stories.  These are just the ones that really stick with me.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is just a hop, skip and a jump from my college, which is super convenient.  Most of the buildings are apartments, but there are a few restaurants and bars sprinkled around that are fun to hang out at without breaking the bank. One bar just got a fancy new name, but it's a bit pricier now.  The drinks aren't bad, but the service is kind of meh.  Mostly, you'll find college kids and folks who are on a tight budget living here,  since the apartments aren't too expensive. There are a ton of kids around too because there's an elementary school just a stone's throw away.  I don't really know my neighbors, and honestly, I'm kinda okay with that. They have a bit of a penchant for marijuana, so the building management put one of those air freshener things right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I thought was hilarious - kinda rude, but funny.  \n\nThe buildings around here are a bit old-fashioned, though some have been spruced up inside.  Down the street, there are these brand new apartment buildings, but I'm not a fan.  They feel kinda cheap and flimsy, but the rent is super high - a total rip-off, in my opinion.  I guess they can get away with it because they're close to campus. \n\nThere's this super cheap eats place just five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates. Everything is microwaved, but hey, it gets the job done.  Across the street is a gas station that doesn't have a great reputation.  But last summer, they redid the road with city money, so now there's a nice wide sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area is looking a bit nicer.  My apartment building is tucked away behind some trees, though they did chop down a few. I guess they're trying to open things up. \n\nBehind my complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind is 43rd Street, and it's not as charming.  The sidewalks are crumbling, and most of the buildings look pretty rough around the edges. There are a lot of trees there too, probably to hide the not-so-pretty buildings. There's been a lot of crime in that area, mostly at one particular apartment complex, though it's not fair to blame them alone.  The apartments across the street from me are also a bit sketchy with a lot of turnover. \n\nOverall, though, I kinda like where I live. It's affordable, and I have everything I need nearby.  The best part is that my college is just a walk away, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood feels like a little slice of old-fashioned charm. It's made up of these cute duplexes, all tucked away on a quiet cul-de-sac. They're spaced out just enough so they look like individual houses, and they all have this sweet, matching look with their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs.  Most of the folks here are friends, and we often gather at the end of the driveways in the evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's so nice to have that sense of community, especially in this crazy, tech-driven world. It feels like stepping back in time.\n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees, with big blue skies and fluffy white clouds. It's picture-perfect, really.  The only downside lately has been the tornado warnings. Last night, we actually heard the sirens! So, there I was, tucked away in my bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows, just in case. My big dog wasn't as keen on the bathroom idea and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The whole neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail pounding on everything. It was pretty intense.  \n\nAfter the storm, the road seemed to be steaming from the temperature change. It went from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes! The hail melted instantly as it hit the hot pavement. As the clouds cleared, the sun came out and started pouring rain. And then, the most amazing thing happened: a double rainbow! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were just as awestruck as I was.\n\nThings calmed down after an hour or so, and people started trickling back home. It was back to normal pretty quickly - moms and kids out playing, dinner cooking.  It's a really friendly neighborhood, and I love it here.  \n\nI live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else.  They all look the same on the outside, but the insides are different. Some are surprisingly small, which I don't quite understand.  I love taking walks in the big field behind my place and heading down to the pond. It's not for swimming, but it's a great spot to see deer. In the morning, you can hear this giant bullfrog singing his heart out. It's a fantastic place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte.  \n\nEvery morning, we're greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like living in a little village. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that bray's in the evenings, letting us know he's around. I feel so lucky to have found this special place.",
            "Hmm...moving to this new place was right around the time I started eighth grade.  Making friends was tough at first, you know? But then I met this awesome guy who lives just two houses down, and another cool dude on my street.  They've moved on since then, but the memories are still there, like little treasures tucked away. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still around, just like those familiar faces in a favorite song.  It's a pretty typical neighborhood, like so many others you see in those movies, full of two-story houses and the sound of kids laughing and playing outside whenever the weather's nice. It's pretty quiet most days, which is kind of nice.\n\nI've never had any trouble with anyone here. People keep to themselves, which is cool.  You're left alone unless you need something, like if you need help moving a heavy box or something.  I've ordered a bunch of stuff online, and not once has anything gone missing from my porch.  It makes me feel safe, knowing I can trust the people around me.\n\nThere's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my house. We've got so many memories there, me and the guys.  We used to play basketball, football, even baseball.  I even got whacked in the nose playing football, which wasn't so fun, but hey, those good times definitely outweigh the bad ones. Now, when I go there, it's mostly to hang out with my cousins' kids. They're little, still into swings and slides and all that. Just thinking about going to the park makes their eyes light up, which is so sweet.  It brings back a whole lot of memories, you know?\n\nThe neighborhood's pretty diverse, which is awesome. You can find all kinds of food around here.  Within just a mile, you've got Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – everything! But these days, everyone seems to be ordering in with those apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.  The usual fast food places are everywhere, and there's always a pizza place on every corner.  \n\nThere are tons of stores, too, with everything you could possibly need.  Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, even a Jewel-Osco grocery store – it's like a mini-city! There's even an Indian store if you're in the mood for some homemade curry or ready-made samosas.\n\nLooking at what other people go through in their neighborhoods, it makes me really appreciate this place. It's a haven, a little slice of peace. I'm grateful to call it home.",
            "My town, Johnston, is a little slice of Southern charm, nestled in the heart of South Carolina. It might not be the flashiest place around, but it's got a special place in my heart, especially when it comes to peaches. You see, Johnston proudly wears the crown of \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title you'll see proudly displayed on the welcome sign.  \n\nEverywhere you look, it's a sea of green, dotted with peach trees and cattle pastures. The houses are mostly spread out, with two-story beauties sporting either metal roofs to beat the summer heat or classic gray shingles. They often sit back from the road, leaving plenty of space for fields and farm animals.\n\nThe heart of town is centered around a single, lonely stoplight at a four-way intersection. It's here you'll find the town's only stores, a testament to its small-town vibe. For a quick bite, you can choose from Hong Kong, a cozy Chinese joint run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a familiar burger chain. We used to have a pizza place, but it sadly closed up shop a while back. \n\nThere's a tiny, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for their delicious Cherry Coca-Cola. Then there's the Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), a bit pricey but the only grocery store for miles around. Most folks prefer to make the trip to Batesburg-Leesville for their weekly shopping spree at Walmart, though. \n\nThe real star of the show is hands down Dollar General. You can find everything you need there, and it's always bustling from opening to closing. There's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a sweet little shop run by a beloved local lady. They've been around forever and even offer delivery with their own movers! Tucked behind the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a full-service pet groomer with daycare and boarding options. \n\nBoth the doctor's office and the veterinary clinic are a bit off the beaten path, but they're well-equipped to take care of the townspeople. \n\nOur only elementary school is Johnston Elementary, but once kids finish fifth grade, they have to head to the next town over for middle and high school.  \n\nParks? Not so much. We're working on a 2.5-acre recreation area to give families a place to hang out and maybe lure in some new residents. But honestly, Johnston isn't exactly a bustling metropolis. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or trendy spots to hang. It's so small, you could practically drive through it without even noticing!  \n\nBut that's the charm of Johnston. It's a quiet, friendly place where everyone knows everyone, and life moves at a slower pace. It may not be flashy, but it's home.",
            "My ears first heard whispers of this place while listening to a podcast about vanished souls. It was a bit of a shocker, really. Every apartment around here goes for over a thousand dollars a month, you know? I'd never heard a peep about any missing persons, and neither had any of my buddies. Maybe it's the struggle, the daily grind. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, worried about making ends meet. Things are pricey, but we've learned to be clever with our money over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty charm of second-hand toys and clothes that have seen better days. You lose that new car smell pretty fast in adulthood. Maybe you pick up a habit like smoking, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But the flea market, oh, that place always calls back to you. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, clinging to the leather even after a good wash.   \n\nThere are three thrift stores within walking distance here. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and a quirky little curio shop. Downtown is bustling, cars and people pouring into the streets every morning, but those thrift stores? They're peaceful sanctuaries. No matter how many people or cars go by, the inside is quiet. It's a perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon. Every year, more and more people and cars seem to flood in. They say it's a developing city, growing pains and all. It reminds me a bit of New York, actually. Everyone here is focused on their own goals, and no one really expects much from you. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like back home, where showing a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into your life, not really. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city just keeps rolling on like waves on the beach. \n\nIt's a vibrant place to be, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we're less like strangers in an apartment building and more like a community of friends. We come together when we need to, for birthdays, funerals, to help each other out. I feel lucky to be here, truthfully. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them a little treat now and then, and they do the same for me. We bring each other mail, lend a hand when needed. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. \n\nI live in this massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "My neighbourhood, well, it's like a picture postcard of suburbia, you know?  Everything's so... neat.  The homeowner's association, they're like the invisible hand making sure everything's just so. Every house looks pretty much the same - a little patch of grass, some fancy rocks, a short driveway, maybe a little tree here and there.  And, of course, every house has a two-car garage. The roads are spotless, not a pothole in sight, all freshly paved.  Most are single-story, but you'll find some two-story ones sprinkled in.  \n\nNow, about the mailboxes -  they're not your typical kind. No individual boxes out front, no sir. It's more like an apartment building, a whole cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street. And there are these big lockers for packages too. Gotta love that HOA love for uniformity. \n\nSince my house sits on the edge of the city, our neighborhood's kind of a mix of country and suburb. We've got tons of space! There are community pools, all fancy and gated, and walking trails where you can take your dog or just go for a peaceful stroll. No need to go to a park for some exercise, you can just run around the neighborhood and get a good workout. \n\nMost folks here are retired, it's a really safe place, everyone looks out for each other. But there are some middle-aged and young professionals sprinkled in too. \n\nThe city itself is a bit of a paradox -  huge by population, but still feels small town cozy.  We've got most of the things you need, like that one mall - not huge, but it does the trick.  It's about a 15-minute drive to get anywhere interesting, but once you get there, there are tons of stores to choose from - fancy organic grocery stores, bargain outlets with just a handful of things and barely any staff... you name it. \n\nSo yeah, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, pretty typical, really.  We've got our community things like pools and trails, and while we're not right next to shopping, it's just a quick drive to anything you could want.",
            "My little corner of the world is a small town, just outside the big city buzz. It feels kinda like everyone knows each other here.  My street, on the east side, it's where the folks who don't have much money live. The houses are older, and most folks are renting. But you know what? It's not bad.  My neighbors, they're like family. Always a friendly wave and a hello when we pass each other.  Things happen, sometimes things get rough, but it's not like it's a scary place. There's been some drama, a few bad things, like shootings and stuff.  Our neighbors next door, they lost their boy last year.  It was heartbreaking.  Luckily, nothing too bad has ever happened to us directly.  Maybe something goes missing from the porch now and then, but that's about it.\n\nThis whole town, it's been hit hard by those \"opioid\" problems you hear about.  It's sad, folks losing their lives to that stuff. But there are good people here. They're trying to help. There are places where folks can get help with addiction, and folks are learning how to use that Narcan thing to save lives.  It's a tough situation, but people are trying.\n\nThere are a lot of good things here too. My son, he goes to a great school. The teachers and everyone there, they're amazing.  He's got special needs, but no one has ever bothered him. The school is so positive, he loves it there. We've got a strong parent group that always has fun events going on.  \n\nBecause so many families here struggle, the school makes sure every kid gets breakfast and lunch for free. No one ever has to worry about going hungry.  They don't judge anyone for not having a lot of money.  School stuff is also really affordable.  \n\nThe city folks have been working hard to make things look nicer.  They've fixed up the roads, planted flowers, and spruced up the parks.  But mostly, they've been focusing on the center of town, where the stores and restaurants are.  My side of town, it seems like it gets left behind sometimes.  That's a bummer, but I still like it here.  \n\nWe've been here for over 16 years. Our house isn't fancy, but it's home.  The people are kind, the schools are great, we've got everything we need, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a place with a story, ya know? Perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of times gone by. I live in a seven-story apartment building, right across from an old theater, its curtain still waiting for its next act. Just down the street, a cool little arcade bar draws in all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Come June and July, especially on weekends, you'll see a line stretching out the door, just buzzing with anticipation. A few blocks up, there's a city park, a green haven in the heart of it all. It's a decent size for this part of town, surrounded by concrete and these tall, sturdy stairs built right into the wall. In the winter, when the cold bites deep and the rain comes pouring down, you see them - folks without homes, setting up their tents in neat little rows along the sidewalk and those wide steps. They huddle close, seeking warmth in numbers,  closer to the city center than the wilderness. It's not far to the family center, either, where they can find a hot shower and a moment of peace.  But what I love most about this place, it's not the history etched into the buildings, the proud structures reaching for the sky or the way the architecture spills down the hills towards the ocean. No, it's the people. You see, Hilltop, once known as the most dangerous place on the West Coast, still carries the weight of its past. Stories linger, whispers passed down through generations, even three decades later, of the feds and the DEA sweeping through, trying to cleanse the streets. The people remember. \n\nThey work hard, even though folks still whisper about the rough edges of Hilltop. They care about their corner of the world, about keeping it clean, about keeping it theirs. Some folks say, \"Don't walk around Hilltop after dark if you're white,\" but I think that's just a shadow of the old days, a lingering echo of fear and prejudice. Maybe it's because I walk with a shade that blends in, or maybe Hilltop sees a kindred spirit in me, someone who knows the sting of prejudice, the weight of assumptions.  I know one thing: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. The streets pulse with a life that makes me feel alive. I've walked those streets in the dark, met people who'd offer me a jacket before they'd think to rob me. The laundromat owner left her store open late so I could charge my phone when the rain trapped me outside.  On the coldest nights, huddled in the shadow of a shop front, I felt invisible until someone stopped, looked me in the eye, and handed me five dollars, whispering, \"You're beautiful, you're valuable.\"  Hilltop is a place where kindness is a language everyone understands.",
            "My life unfolds in the heart of rural America, nestled amidst  the rolling farmland and charming tourist towns of small-town Michigan. It's a place where you won't find the bustling energy of big city malls, the familiar giants like Walmart or Target, or even a casual dining spot like Applebee's. Everything requires a little drive, a journey that takes you through the picturesque landscape.  But despite the lack of urban conveniences, I live in a slice of paradise, surrounded by the shimmering allure of water. My little town is cradled between the majestic Lake Michigan and the serene beauty of Lake Charlevoix. Every direction you turn, you'll find a beach beckoning you to dip your toes into its cool embrace.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the true spirit of small-town living. Houses stand proudly, each with its own unique story, some boasting updated interiors while others retain their vintage charm. Basements, the kind you can peek into from the street, are a common sight, and the houses wear their colorful aluminum siding like badges of honor.  Here, you'll find a kaleidoscope of colors adorning the blocks, a testament to the individuality of its residents. Most homes have yards, spaces where children's laughter echoes as they bounce on trampolines or swing on playsets. Gardens bloom with vibrant flowers, and fences enclose furry companions, creating a tapestry of life and family. \n\nIt's a neighborhood that reflects the heart of Middle America, a place where hard-working folks strive to build a life for themselves and their families. The streets are alive with the joyful sounds of children playing, dogs barking, and the rhythmic whir of bikes and rollerblades. The sense of community is tangible; neighbors greet each other with waves and smiles, forming a network of support and familiarity.  \n\nThe lawns are meticulously maintained, free from the clutter of fallen leaves and boasting emerald green grass.  Gardens are meticulously pruned, and bushes are trimmed to perfection, creating an atmosphere of order and care. This isn't a neighborhood that boasts ostentatious mansions, but a place that whispers, \"welcome home.\" It's a haven where families feel safe and secure, a place to put down roots and watch your children grow.\n\nJust a stone's throw away, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, a symbol of security and order.  The Health department is a close neighbor, ensuring the well-being of the community.  The recycling center stands ready to serve the needs of residents. \n\nThe sound of baseball games fills the air as children and adults alike enjoy the thrill of the game. Nearby, the small town airport hums with activity, the rumble of planes taking off and landing a constant reminder of the world beyond.  A local ice cream parlor beckons with its sweet aroma, and a short stroll takes you to the heart of downtown.  My children can ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away, where they can spend hours of carefree joy."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city is a real melting pot, you know? It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle with all these different pieces fitting together in a crazy way.  Living here is like being on a never-ending adventure. You've got your residential pockets scattered all over the place, tucked in between shops and restaurants and offices.  It's like a feast for the senses, with new places popping up all the time. \n\nWe've got those big, fancy stores that everyone knows, but then there are these hidden gems, these little boutiques that just make you want to pop in. They're everywhere, even on quiet streets you wouldn't expect, adding a touch of magic to the everyday.  And don't even get me started on the parks! They're always filled with families, kids running around, having fun. It's heartwarming to see. \n\nSpeaking of diverse, this place is bursting with different cultures.  Right here in my neighborhood, you've got your LGBTQ+ folks, a tight-knit Orthodox Jewish community, and even folks who have made their way here from the old Soviet Union. It's like a little world within a world.  \n\nAnd if you venture a little further out, you'll find even more communities, like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia... they're all just a stone's throw away, but sometimes getting there feels like a journey. Traffic can be a nightmare, especially during rush hour.  You can drive for miles and miles, but it might only take you a few blocks.\n\nIt's funny, though, because even with all this traffic, everyone seems to be adding more buildings to the city.  New apartment blocks are springing up everywhere, but some people are starting to worry that it's getting too crowded.\n\nBut hey, there's something for everyone here. You've got your big apartment buildings, your cozy houses, even duplexes.  It's all mixed up, just like the people who live here.\n\nI've lived here my whole life, but I still feel like I'm constantly meeting new people.  It's not exactly a tight-knit community anymore, but that's okay. It's still exciting, always something new to discover. Maybe that's the beauty of city life, always keeping you on your toes.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a quirky little slice of America, ya know? Most of the houses are like those classic single-family ones, but some folks split 'em up, making two homes out of one, still attached like twins. My place has got a little patch of grass out front and a teeny driveway, just enough for one car. It's like a picture postcard from a bygone era, back when the American dream meant living in the suburbs.  Back then, it felt like everyone was chasing that dream, but now, it's like the dream's drifting away, getting harder to hold onto. \n\nBut my neighborhood, it's still holding strong, whispering that the dream's still out there, just gotta keep reachin' for it. Folks ain't as hopeful as they used to be, the lawns ain't as manicured, but you still see a couple cars in most driveways, and the kids, they're running wild, like the world's their playground. There's this old school, been around for nigh on 90 years, still standing tall, givin' kids a glimpse of the future, while the old folks reminisce about their own school days. Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts? Packed! All the houses look different, but they all feel the same, like they're part of the same story.\n\nWe got this big supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by this big, friendly Yemeni family, they're probably the only Arab folks around here. Most folks are African American, generations deep, with stories about when everyone knew everyone.\n\nThere used to be a karate school, but when those Karate Kid movies went outta style, kids lost interest, so now it's a pharmacy. Guess they figured pills were the new kung fu, huh? Then there's this tiny movie theater, showing oldies for cheap.  Too old-fashioned for the young folks, but the older folks love it, a night out without all the hustle and bustle.\n\nWe got this expressway runnin' through town, but the on and off ramps are just outside our borders. Tried to get an exit, young folks wanted it, but the old-timers said it'd ruin our town. They got their way, kept things just the way they were. Now they're buildin' a new high school, and we're tryin' to pick a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a Southern drawl and a log cabin would sum up our town pretty good.",
            "Hmm...you might just miss it at first glance, this little corner tucked behind the shops. Not the kinda place you'd think folks would want to call home, not at first. But pry past the old, dusty Whole Foods and past the hotels that mostly sit empty, save for a few family get-togethers in the summer, and you'll stumble onto a whole world buzzing with life.  It's like a secret society, these streets and these apartment complexes huddled together like a bunch of Russian nesting dolls, all taken apart and laid out in a line.  You'll see some complexes that've been in the news for some not-so-nice stuff, so let's not dwell on those, yeah? Appearances can be deceiving. But the ones next to those, the ones beside those, those are a whole other story, a world most folks around here never even know about.\n\nJust across from those complexes, you've got this community college, a little branch campus. Quiet as a mouse, it is, with students shuffling in, coffee in hand, yawning like it's the end of the world at seven in the morning. The iron gates creak open for them one by one, while folks rushing to work shake their fists and grumble about them slowing things down on busy days. The road just kinda forks off into another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehab center for folks who've had a few… mishaps. The rehab center's got these cheerful porch chairs and a ceiling fan that goes round and round, pushing the thick summer air back and forth.\n\nKids are running around in the park, cartwheeling and spinning like crazy in the grass, while bees buzz around the flowers by the road. Old folks walk their dogs, grumbling at the teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the girls gossiping by the playground, talking about boys and YouTube videos. There's a sushi place in a strip mall by the park, cheap eats but never too crowded. Right beside that's a swimming supply store, and tucked in between them is a nail salon. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat hibachi chicken all at once. That's the magic of a strip mall, you know?\n\nAnd there's a frozen yogurt place there too, the kind where you build your own concoction. You see the kids from the park all the time, holding their cold, dripping cups of yogurt, doing skateboard tricks and puffing away on vapes because they think it makes them look cool.\n\nThis whole neighborhood is a slice of America, a little piece of history frozen in time down here in the sleepy south, where not even time itself seems to rush.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the endless cornfields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she wouldn't believe how simple and open everything was. She was used to living in a town where everything was just a short walk away, she'd never seen this much space in her life. Overwhelmed by all the corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we continued down this two-lane country road, we came to a quarry filled with water. Just past it was the little development where I live. The houses are mostly built with brick and stucco, and each one has at least half an acre of land that everyone takes pride in keeping up. In the springtime, there are flowers everywhere, along with the Midwestern trees that change color with each season.  All the driveways are filled with fancy Mercedes Benz cars that gleam in the sunlight after a good wash.\n\nDriving further down the road towards my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly smile. He spends the whole day mowing his lawn and you can hear him singing over the sound of the mower. Everyone in the neighborhood thinks it's funny, but he's such a good guy with a really interesting story. He's getting older now and isn't quite as sharp as he used to be. Back in the day, he was a doctor, and now he blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese roam around and are chased by our terrier. In the back, there's a little stream that flows into the quarry.  Here you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and sometimes even a \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge is a peaceful oasis filled with trees, herbs, and wildflowers that grow naturally. This is where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to chasing animals (mostly just chasing them!), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood friend to play with.\n\nThe winters in my small town can be really tough, but they're also beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green to a bare wilderness. The trees that were once covered in colorful flowers become bare skeletons of bark. When it snows, which it does sometimes, everything turns into a winter wonderland overnight. The backyard is filled with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I used to fight a lot when we were kids, and in the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We'd build huge igloo-like forts to store our weapons, usually sticks and branches, like we were in a secret army. In our own little winter wonderland, we played pretend and forgot about everything else. We were just kids, free and happy.",
            "Hmm...let me tell you about Portland, Oregon, this place with a unique kind of \"weirdness\". You'll see it everywhere, even on the side of a building that's part pizza joint, part bar, part music venue, part strip club...you get the picture.  They say \"Keep Portland Weird\" there, like it's a promise.  Some folks, they remember the old Portland, back when it was still hidden away and affordable. That's the Portland that birthed all the creative, quirky subcultures. Others, well, they see it as an invitation - come to Portland, where being different is a good thing, something to celebrate.  Even with all those fancy Californians moving in and those shiny new condos popping up everywhere, Portland still holds onto that weirdness.\n\nBut what exactly does \"weird\" mean here? It's not about being totally accepting of everything, no. It's about accepting the things that might make others raise an eyebrow. It's about knowing that we still have all the modern conveniences and the same everyday struggles as anywhere else. Sure, we buy most of our stuff from China, just like everyone else. There are a million ways to be different, to not fit in, and Portland has plenty of those. \n\nYou'll find yoga studios, hipsters, and suits working in offices here, just like anywhere else. Maybe \"weird\" just means we take it all a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, and in lots of others, you'll see houses painted in all sorts of bright colors, gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and even free boxes lining the sidewalks. These boxes, well, they're a Portland tradition. They're filled with treasures - clothes, books, sometimes even something completely unexpected. It's like a little surprise waiting for you around every corner.  \n\nThat magical feeling of discovering something special in the most ordinary places, that's what Portland is all about to me. At least, that's my version of weird. I know there are thousands of other kinds of weird here. Some folks wouldn't dream of taking anything out of a box on the street. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yes, you read that right!) or cheer on the Timbers soccer team. Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things, dream big, or at least dream about dreaming big while sipping a pint at the local pub. \n\nWe're not perfect, though. Like anywhere else, we have our struggles. Portland has a drug problem, and it's hard not to see the connection between that and the mental health issues that often go hand in hand. The constant rain and gray skies probably don't help either. And then there's the issue of homelessness, a problem that seems to plague every city. Portland tries to help, but our programs aren't enough.  Some people here are compassionate, while others just give up hope. Honestly, that's not so weird, is it? It's just part of being human.",
            "The mountains, they've always been there, like silent guardians watching over everything. Northward, they stand tall, witnessing every sunrise and sunset, unmoved by the hustle and bustle of life. Even when I'm caught up in my studies or work, they're still there, solid and unwavering. On days when stress weighs heavy on me, they seem to call out, demanding to be seen. And when I turn to them, they offer a calming presence, a source of strength to carry on, one day at a time.\n\nIt all started when I first moved here for university. The mountains north of campus captured my heart immediately. The university itself has its own beauty – the buildings, the ponds, the trees – each holding a special place in my memory. But the mountains, they rule them all.  \n\nThe town itself is a charming mix of the familiar and the unexpected. There are countless cafes where I spent countless hours fueled by coffee and late-night study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where faded brick buildings whisper stories of a bygone era. It's here that the town pulses with a vibrant energy, almost as if it's trying to outshine its bustling city neighbor. But just a few blocks away, you can escape back to the peaceful charm of small-town life, passing by the library on your way. This beautiful contrast, this close proximity of two distinct atmospheres, gives the town a magical quality, inviting you to explore its every nook and cranny.\n\nIt's a town where memories are made, both cherished and bittersweet. There's the rusty swing set in the park, where friends and I would congregate after all-nighters, or the frantic dash through the downtown area to catch a movie at the fancy theater thanks to a student discount. But like all places, it holds its share of painful memories too. The ponds, especially, seem to be a magnet for introspection and tearful confessions at 2 a.m. during existential crises – an experience I've had more times than I care to admit.\n\nWhile watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each with their own purpose, I couldn't help but question my own path. I walked past the pond, the park, the houses that screamed suburbia, until I found myself on a main street. As I walked, the sun bathed the palm trees in its golden light, painting the sky with vibrant hues. Looking up, I realized I was heading north. And there they were, as steadfast as ever. The mountains, majestically towering above everything else, their presence a silent reminder of my own strength and perseverance.",
            "My, oh my, if you ever find yourself planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it!  Getting around is a breeze, especially with the awesome public transportation, you know, one of the big things in New York City.  Bensonhurst has a real city vibe, so you'll be smack-dab in the heart of it all.  \n\nAnd speaking of vibes, get ready for a real sensory experience! You'll see these amazing Asian stores everywhere you look. In the last twenty years or so, Bensonhurst has become a real melting pot, especially with all the Asian folks moving in.  It's like every block has an Asian-owned store, you'll be spoiled for choice! Supermarkets and laundromats seem to be the most popular, and they're a hit with everyone, not just the Asian community. The food in the supermarkets is top-notch, the prices are super reasonable, and let's be honest, it's just so darn convenient. I mean, I live right near a cluster of four Asian supermarkets, all within a couple of minutes walking distance! Talk about convenience!\n\nBut don't think Bensonhurst is all about one culture, oh no! It's a real mix of people, with immigrants, and their kids who are first and second generation Americans, all living together.  While most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, there's a cool new park nearby that's got something for everyone. Ten basketball courts, a huge field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for the little ones, even a water fountain to cool off in the summer. It's a true melting pot, with people from all walks of life hanging out and getting along.\n\nAs for buildings, you won't find too many big, corporate towers here. Mostly, it's co-op buildings and condos. The majority of peeps live in these cute two-family houses, though.  The people here are generally nice, but can be a bit noisy, if you catch my drift.  Cars blasting music as they drive by,  people revving their engines in the morning...it can wake you right up! If you're planning to be out at night, keep your wits about you.  Bensonhurst is pretty safe, but you never know when you might run into some troublemakers, bullies, or even thieves. I've been through some things here myself, a few run-ins in the past, nothing too bad, but it's good to be aware. \n\nAnother thing, there's been a bit of a package theft problem lately.  Not a good look, right?  And while New York City has rules about cleaning up after your dog, some folks don't seem to get the memo.  Every morning, you'll probably see at least one piece of dog waste on your way to the train or the supermarket.  It's a real pet peeve of mine, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood is a peculiar place, perched precariously on the highest hill in town. People call it the \"workout hill\" because all the runners love to challenge themselves with its steep incline. The lack of sidewalks forces everyone to walk on the road, which is cracked and uneven in spots, making it a bit of a bumpy ride. The power lines strung across the street tell a story of their own, tattered and patched together after countless encounters with falling branches and storms.  \n\nEverywhere you look, towering evergreen trees stand sentinel.  But here's the funny thing - folks around here despise them! They're always trying to chop them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are built high up on the hill, with giant second stories boasting glass walls, desperately trying to catch a glimpse of the bay.\n\nSunsets are breathtaking, though. The water shimmers like liquid gold, and the sky explodes in a blaze of orange. Most days, though, the clouds steal the show, shrouding everything in a soft, damp haze. Moss thrives in this dampness, clinging to roofs, cars, even railings. Once, I left my car parked for a month, and it emerged looking like a furry green monster - three hours of scrubbing later, it was finally clean.\n\nKids are a rare sight in our neighborhood.  There's a school just a few blocks away, but it's mostly populated by retired folks.  Dogs, on the other hand, are everywhere. You'll find them lounging on lawns, chasing each other down the street, or sometimes, even sneaking into your house if you leave a door open!  I once found one in my living room, patiently waiting for a treat.\n\nRabbits also roam freely, much to the annoyance of gardeners who find their burrows digging up precious plants. But my cats are thrilled, having hunted most of them out of our yard.  We also have our fair share of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle, who often get chased away by the resident crows.\n\nThere aren't any stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood.  The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can easily see the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "Hmm... life here is kinda like one of those slow-moving movies, you know?  I live on this little street in a sleepy town down south, kinda tucked between two busy highways.  So, we get our fair share of traffic, nothin' too wild though. It's a pretty quiet neighborhood, most folks here have lived here for ages, so we all know each other pretty well.  It's the kind of place where everyone's busy with their own thing - tending to their yards, running errands, that kinda stuff.   \n\nWe live on the corner, so we get a front-row seat to all the neighborhood action. We know all the cars that go by, and if somethin' new rolls up, well, we take notice.  Some folks like to take walks, others walk their dogs, and the kids, they're always whizzing around on their bikes.  \n\nMy wife and I work from home, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen, are always underfoot. We're pretty much homebodies, so everyone's used to seeing us come and go. We love to play outside, even when it's drizzling, and we'll fire up the grill on our back deck whenever we get the chance.  It's like an unspoken rule - you gotta smell that barbecue at least once a week! \n\nThere's nothin' but trees around here, it used to be all woods, so we've got plenty of shade, but that means a whole lot of leaves come Fall. Raking and burning leaves is practically a family tradition. That smoky smell just screams \"Autumn\" to me, you know?\n\nThis year, we haven't had much of a winter at all, just a long, drawn-out Fall.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we only use the front door for company, which isn't often.\n\nI like to tinker in the garage with my truck or other projects, and when the doors are open, I feel like I'm more connected to the whole neighborhood. Holidays are a little more lively - Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas - folks come visit and the street gets crowded with cars.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty good life here.  If it weren't for that through-street traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where it's dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably don't get it. Like, you just don't understand the feeling of seeing brown everywhere you look. And when you do see a lawn, you know that person is dropping serious cash on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first lived here, the houses were spread out like they were trying to escape each other. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a bunch of new places popping up. Honestly, it's starting to feel more like a city every day, but I guess that's happening everywhere, right?\n\nMost of the people here are really friendly, just like in any place, you have your ups and downs. But in my part of town, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so it's a pretty nice place to be.\n\nThe stores around here are mostly the chain kind, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for something upscale, you gotta drive a bit. Never see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here. \n\nBased on what I see, the biggest industry in town is construction. I think that's because the city is still growing. There are still tons of wide-open spaces waiting to be built on.  It kinda freaks me out, actually. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city, and I'm not looking to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living – drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nOne of the things I love about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert itself is definitely a big draw. The high desert climate and landscape have created some pretty amazing ecosystems that need protecting. We share this space with all sorts of awesome creatures, and it's important that we learn about them so we can live together peacefully.\n\nMy family and I have gotten pretty good at coexisting with the wildlife. I have three kids, and they're obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. They're out there right now, trying to catch all sorts of interesting critters.\n\nAs for things to do around here, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert in a different way.  If you're visiting, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a ton of fun, and it really captures the Victorville spirit.  \n\nYou can also head up to nearby Wrightwood to see the snowy mountains and even take a winter sports lesson. \n\nIf you're interested in learning about the history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit. They have all sorts of cool stuff – geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how Victorville came to be.",
            "Hmm...my heart n soui went to Taiwan last Thursday,on the 1st to be precise. Im going to miss him and it has only been a day and yet here I am looking at his photo... again and again as if the world is going to come tumbling down.  Yup...his job is kinda time constraining,him an officer in the army ... I have to live with that for the rest of my life. Yet, I am happy with him. There's chemistry and we could talk about anything from weapons,politics or even the simple terminology of self reflection. I feel safe with him...maybe he is my knight n shinning armour who  has come to save me amidst the confusion. He was so sweet,the day he called me before he flew off, he said ' In any decision that you are going to make, I will say yes to it all,I wiil support you and at the end of the day, I will always be there for you,' I almost cried when he said that, Ive been waiting for someone to tell me that.  Dear Khai,my knight and shinning armour, come back to me when your job is done...   Untukmu Khai  Untukmu Ku saluti benang-benang sutera, menjadi perhiasan setiap pereka, menjadi keinginan si dara jelita, menjadi rebutan si putera raja... Setiap lirikan mata, Setiap gerak geri bicara, Ku perkemaskan tenunan, Ku halusi perasaan, Lalu,dengan perlahan redup matamu ku perhatikan, Lalu aku relakan... mereka istana pasir, dari embun-embun kasih.  - 3.4.2004                  tired...the whole day in school was spend in meetings. A friend of mine sms me saying that he had just came back from a short getaway. At first I was so relieved that he message me...then again. Believing in your feelings can really be difficult...especially when the other party does not feel the same way.To cross a friends path thats another issue...hmm,did some surfing on the net,discovered some beautiful poems.  This poem captured my heart,it goes on like this,  A Dream within a Dream by Edgar Allen Poe   Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem That my days have been a dream; Yet, if Hope has flown away In a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it, therefore, the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.  I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?  Been thinking of a certain someone that I really like...once upon a time. When everything was so  colourful, the air was sweet, the trees were beautiful...hmm.Thinking that it was meant to last forever n ever. Indeed, it only existed in fairy tales.True enough.                 Yesterday, the 4 of us went to Bukit Batok, me, my sis, ayu n hanip. We went to meet Keris, they were feeling kinda of down. Pity them. After that, we went and have a drink at Mas Ayu wif the other Kelana guys. Hmm...ayu cracking jokes about Talib, all the way from Bukit Batok to Mas Ayu. We were out control...giggling and laughing our hearts out throughout the journey. Irony.  I woke up late this morning. Marking my karangan...the neverending ordeal. After this, Im suppose to meet my P6EM3. I just realise how happy I am. although Im shoudering a lot of responsibilities.   The other day, my sis saw Khai, presuming with his wife. Hmm...life, what can I say. Yet, the bigger picture is, trust, guys and marriage. Marriage is a huge responsibility... a commitment. Nevertheless, when to think of it back, everything make sense. Maybe, it was a good thing in getting to know him, yup...he hurt me, but if we were to look at it at another perspective, he had hurt his partner even more, the trust. Me, being the third party. Retribution, I do not want to see it coming. I love my dear Hanip so much. Even to think of it, will make me sick. Then again, if it is meant to be...then be it. In life we have to be strong in tackling problem. It can be him and it can be me. He told me,  feelings can change, which is terribly true.     2.55 pm   Just finish cutting the tickets, the alignment has gone haywired. Ismail has been bugging me on the tickets. Hmm...Im searching for the C.C chop, I misplaced it , somehow. Im tired. My eyes are tired. Im tired. Ismail asked me whether they can use the mirror room. I try to see what I can do.    5.55 pm  Hmm...at de spur of moments, things can change. Now, Im feeling restless. Sad.   ' Which is one is better, 3 years or one n a half year...'  I think it is better if it is 3 years, then I won't be leaving in denial.  An everlasting commitment... ' the person can be me or you...' it can be Me or you...  &nbsp;     Kris Dayanti & Ajai          After reading my previous post, it lead me to think, saya ni orangnya berjiwang-jiwang. Hmm...enough of that sweetness in the air, the cloud nine, the everlasting cotton wool and being dragged back to the ground. Yesterday was the MAEC meeting, yup...we are going to have the gigantic group around...its not confimed yet but then again the glitters that we see in their eyes...can outshine the indoor stadium,hmm,im just exaggerating huh..     My sis and I decided to stay on because of these words...' We wont be in the CC, without you guys around,' hmm...so touched by what my dear bro Ayu had to say. And again we decided to stay on because of our dear ...Mr Zahidi Rahman, our supportive chairman. He actually begged us to stay. Thus,this year the first project is sponsored by the Heritage Centre with the help of us the MAEC.  Yup...the outlining of the budget, the Arts, and the most important thing the objective. For Mega Perdana...I don't really care. Mega Perdana had already been auction for the mere of $5,000. The so called Chairman is responsible for this.   Therefore, Singapore expect the next ala Gentarasa or even a bigger event to be truly organised by MAEC Siglap South and the Giants... Yesterday, Rizal called, he told me to write lyrics for the group. The theme, hmmm...something to do with Paruh... belum berilham hamba...  13 days to go, Khai. : )   'Love is not a matter of counting the years... it's making the years count.  --Wolfman Jack Smith                 yesterday was a very tiring and long day...woke up late to school. Hmm...had our Malam Anugerah Dikir 2004 penilaian...everyone was there.The emotional part was seeing them,the so called ' orang lama of the dikir barat world ' together after long years apart. Today,got an email... procedures on the registration to enrol on a degree programme in UM .still thinking,got the green light from my family.hmm...maybe I should enrol,there's nothing much left for me here,macam sedih gitukan... My friend told me, have you ever heard of the story about the Science teacher and her jar, the science teacher,put a few golf ball inside the jar,still its not full,the she put in some pebbles,followed by sand and the water. Then she said, in life we have to priorities,who are the golf balls,who symbolizes the sands and so on and so forth.The golf balls are people that are dear to you,people who meant a lot to you,the sand and the water symbolizes the so not important people,those that you can live without.Look here she said,you have to put the golf balls first,not the sand or the water.If you were to put the water first,you cannot put your golf balls...put the golfballs,then the pebbles,then the sand...then the water,you have to know. True...my families are my golf balls...the people that are dear to you.A friend told me that I kept making these stupid mistakes due to the fact that Im lonely, ehheheeh..more of a pathetic twisted personality. Now,Im a bit focus,confident tak tau asal...mungkin dah penat...mungkin. Adakah yang benar itu benar...tidak benar.                    Im hurting again...that's the irony part,I don't know why I am feeling this way. I can feel my heart bleeding thou...its happening again.Yup...as if a knife,slowly piercing deep through me. Yesterday, I went out with him and he brought up the issue of one of the gerl's group. I was so pissed off... yup... I totally lose control and the worse part, it was only like  30%  of my anger... bursting...it was not a full blast,then again.. it did make an impact.I kind of settled in when he crack some jokes about the boriah tingy...hmm,he is sweet...very sweet.  Guess what...7 new messages.Hmm...so many people I've blocked from my msn.Missed chatting with Shariffah aka yan, been busy lately...hmmm...  Again, let us analyse what the hell am I suffering from...is it an infectious or contagious disease...heheheeh, maybe I need to rest for another month or was it a pure act of jealousy..nah,that would be the last thing.... then again, maybe if you love the person too much, I would just like to imagine him being wrapped up neatly,in a package,put it in my closet,far away from all the girls as possible.At one point,I tend to become restless,twitchy and uneasy when he mentioned to me about his x.Im not a paranoid.To look at my past, I do have loads of Xs but then was then. Perhaps,Ive never been ditch before.The feeling must be overwhelming.Hmm...sad to say this,I think he still loves his x...that's it!! I couldn't sleep because I think he has feelings for his x. I feel terrible now...inferiority lurkes again. What a jughead, how can I not see this.. thats why I am feeling miserable..it has nothing to do with that masked man... Shucks...hmmm...jiwa retak pulak saya ni... Hai...how love can makes you a desperado and defy the norms.merepeknyelah saya...: ) Im listening to... Ada Apa Dengan Cinta...apa nak jadi hafidah,yeah...away feminisme and what is left of it...                     Guess what...a fren of mine by the name of Zai called, he hated when I call him that, the kelkatu man.heheeh,hmm...he sounded suprise. He asked me, ' Do you know that .....in your CC,' I said ' Yeah,Ive discussed it with Ayu,' The matter of the fact was, I dont really care...I mean the C.C stuff and more...Im in cloud nine you see and the only thing I can think off when Im marking and stuff like that is to think about my dear Khai in Taiwan.Has he eaten,taken his bath or the most important thing does he look at the stars every night and think of me, like I think of him.ehehhe.    The irony part here, is that Ive known him...what like nearly two months perhaps and the impact he gave me.I have to admit, the first time I met him,it was a mutual thing, a fren thing, like I meet my other frens. Then goes on to the next meeting plus the hours we hang on the phone.hmm...kita boleh bergayut berjam-jam.  Seldom people can just have the same chemistry bonding with me and the one that I want to be with is not just any Tom, Dick or Harry, he must be confident but at the same time humble... Any Tom, Dick or Harry can be found anywhere,under the drain,clubhouses,brushing their ego or just looking at themselves in the mirror and telling it straight to their face that they are big time losers.   Being in a relationship is not just uttering a few words like  I love you  or  I want you  , being true to each other,and to truly feel at lost when the other party is not around. Nevertheless,his picture or his last words somehow cure the emptiness inside.  I don't understand on how sometimes relationship is build on  a stupid lie. To be truthful is a responsibility to the loved ones.When you commit to someone, you don't only give your words...its more than that.     Something to digest ....Les Brown - I believe there are three kinds of people. There are winners, who know what they want and understand their potential and the possibilities. They take life on. Next are losers, who don't have a clue as to who they are. They allow circumstances to shape their lives and their self-image. I believe there is a third group as well. This consists of potential winners whose lives are just slightly out of alignment. I call them wayward winners...",
            "Hmm...my heart's been in Stockbridge for about 10 years now.  When I first got here from Riverdale, I'll admit, I had a good cry. Missing my old family and friends really hit me hard.  But my parents, they wanted the best for me and my little sister. A better place to live, a better school...you know, like they always say, \"a step up from the ghetto.\"  I guess over time, I got used to it all. Made some new friends, some people who just rubbed me the wrong way. I never really got close to the neighbors though, except for Mr. Glen and his kids.  And Dennis for a little while. They're like family to me, I'm really grateful for them.\n\nRemember that time we went to Mr. Glen's wedding?  He and Ms. Veda tied the knot again. It was a blast!  I caught the little white strap she took off her leg, but I missed the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I had a real good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing great!\n\nThis neighborhood can be a bit of a puzzle, but with my GPS, I'm exploring more. Mostly, I hang out with my buddies Kason and Curtis.  We used to be glued to the video games, just living it up. Sometimes I'd head to the park, just to soak up some nature. It really calms me down.  Makes me feel at peace. I might bring some sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, maybe even my bokken if I can. It's just fun to do the things I love.  \n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court there too, even though I haven't touched a racket or a ball in ages.  Still nice to have around, you know, just in case I feel like playing again. My dad and Mr. Graves, they really got me and my best friend hooked on tennis back in the day. We had a blast! They pushed us hard, but it was always fun.\n\nThere are so many good times here, so many stories.  These are just the ones that really stick with me.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is just a hop, skip and a jump from my college, which is super convenient.  Most of the buildings are apartments, but there are a few restaurants and bars sprinkled around that are fun to hang out at without breaking the bank. One bar just got a fancy new name, but it's a bit pricier now.  The drinks aren't bad, but the service is kind of meh.  Mostly, you'll find college kids and folks who are on a tight budget living here,  since the apartments aren't too expensive. There are a ton of kids around too because there's an elementary school just a stone's throw away.  I don't really know my neighbors, and honestly, I'm kinda okay with that. They have a bit of a penchant for marijuana, so the building management put one of those air freshener things right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I thought was hilarious - kinda rude, but funny.  \n\nThe buildings around here are a bit old-fashioned, though some have been spruced up inside.  Down the street, there are these brand new apartment buildings, but I'm not a fan.  They feel kinda cheap and flimsy, but the rent is super high - a total rip-off, in my opinion.  I guess they can get away with it because they're close to campus. \n\nThere's this super cheap eats place just five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates. Everything is microwaved, but hey, it gets the job done.  Across the street is a gas station that doesn't have a great reputation.  But last summer, they redid the road with city money, so now there's a nice wide sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area is looking a bit nicer.  My apartment building is tucked away behind some trees, though they did chop down a few. I guess they're trying to open things up. \n\nBehind my complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind is 43rd Street, and it's not as charming.  The sidewalks are crumbling, and most of the buildings look pretty rough around the edges. There are a lot of trees there too, probably to hide the not-so-pretty buildings. There's been a lot of crime in that area, mostly at one particular apartment complex, though it's not fair to blame them alone.  The apartments across the street from me are also a bit sketchy with a lot of turnover. \n\nOverall, though, I kinda like where I live. It's affordable, and I have everything I need nearby.  The best part is that my college is just a walk away, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood feels like a little slice of old-fashioned charm. It's made up of these cute duplexes, all tucked away on a quiet cul-de-sac. They're spaced out just enough so they look like individual houses, and they all have this sweet, matching look with their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs.  Most of the folks here are friends, and we often gather at the end of the driveways in the evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's so nice to have that sense of community, especially in this crazy, tech-driven world. It feels like stepping back in time.\n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees, with big blue skies and fluffy white clouds. It's picture-perfect, really.  The only downside lately has been the tornado warnings. Last night, we actually heard the sirens! So, there I was, tucked away in my bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows, just in case. My big dog wasn't as keen on the bathroom idea and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The whole neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail pounding on everything. It was pretty intense.  \n\nAfter the storm, the road seemed to be steaming from the temperature change. It went from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes! The hail melted instantly as it hit the hot pavement. As the clouds cleared, the sun came out and started pouring rain. And then, the most amazing thing happened: a double rainbow! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were just as awestruck as I was.\n\nThings calmed down after an hour or so, and people started trickling back home. It was back to normal pretty quickly - moms and kids out playing, dinner cooking.  It's a really friendly neighborhood, and I love it here.  \n\nI live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else.  They all look the same on the outside, but the insides are different. Some are surprisingly small, which I don't quite understand.  I love taking walks in the big field behind my place and heading down to the pond. It's not for swimming, but it's a great spot to see deer. In the morning, you can hear this giant bullfrog singing his heart out. It's a fantastic place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte.  \n\nEvery morning, we're greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like living in a little village. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that bray's in the evenings, letting us know he's around. I feel so lucky to have found this special place.",
            "Hmm...moving to this new place was right around the time I started eighth grade.  Making friends was tough at first, you know? But then I met this awesome guy who lives just two houses down, and another cool dude on my street.  They've moved on since then, but the memories are still there, like little treasures tucked away. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still around, just like those familiar faces in a favorite song.  It's a pretty typical neighborhood, like so many others you see in those movies, full of two-story houses and the sound of kids laughing and playing outside whenever the weather's nice. It's pretty quiet most days, which is kind of nice.\n\nI've never had any trouble with anyone here. People keep to themselves, which is cool.  You're left alone unless you need something, like if you need help moving a heavy box or something.  I've ordered a bunch of stuff online, and not once has anything gone missing from my porch.  It makes me feel safe, knowing I can trust the people around me.\n\nThere's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my house. We've got so many memories there, me and the guys.  We used to play basketball, football, even baseball.  I even got whacked in the nose playing football, which wasn't so fun, but hey, those good times definitely outweigh the bad ones. Now, when I go there, it's mostly to hang out with my cousins' kids. They're little, still into swings and slides and all that. Just thinking about going to the park makes their eyes light up, which is so sweet.  It brings back a whole lot of memories, you know?\n\nThe neighborhood's pretty diverse, which is awesome. You can find all kinds of food around here.  Within just a mile, you've got Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – everything! But these days, everyone seems to be ordering in with those apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.  The usual fast food places are everywhere, and there's always a pizza place on every corner.  \n\nThere are tons of stores, too, with everything you could possibly need.  Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, even a Jewel-Osco grocery store – it's like a mini-city! There's even an Indian store if you're in the mood for some homemade curry or ready-made samosas.\n\nLooking at what other people go through in their neighborhoods, it makes me really appreciate this place. It's a haven, a little slice of peace. I'm grateful to call it home.",
            "My town, Johnston, is a little slice of Southern charm, nestled in the heart of South Carolina. It might not be the flashiest place around, but it's got a special place in my heart, especially when it comes to peaches. You see, Johnston proudly wears the crown of \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title you'll see proudly displayed on the welcome sign.  \n\nEverywhere you look, it's a sea of green, dotted with peach trees and cattle pastures. The houses are mostly spread out, with two-story beauties sporting either metal roofs to beat the summer heat or classic gray shingles. They often sit back from the road, leaving plenty of space for fields and farm animals.\n\nThe heart of town is centered around a single, lonely stoplight at a four-way intersection. It's here you'll find the town's only stores, a testament to its small-town vibe. For a quick bite, you can choose from Hong Kong, a cozy Chinese joint run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a familiar burger chain. We used to have a pizza place, but it sadly closed up shop a while back. \n\nThere's a tiny, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for their delicious Cherry Coca-Cola. Then there's the Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), a bit pricey but the only grocery store for miles around. Most folks prefer to make the trip to Batesburg-Leesville for their weekly shopping spree at Walmart, though. \n\nThe real star of the show is hands down Dollar General. You can find everything you need there, and it's always bustling from opening to closing. There's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a sweet little shop run by a beloved local lady. They've been around forever and even offer delivery with their own movers! Tucked behind the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a full-service pet groomer with daycare and boarding options. \n\nBoth the doctor's office and the veterinary clinic are a bit off the beaten path, but they're well-equipped to take care of the townspeople. \n\nOur only elementary school is Johnston Elementary, but once kids finish fifth grade, they have to head to the next town over for middle and high school.  \n\nParks? Not so much. We're working on a 2.5-acre recreation area to give families a place to hang out and maybe lure in some new residents. But honestly, Johnston isn't exactly a bustling metropolis. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or trendy spots to hang. It's so small, you could practically drive through it without even noticing!  \n\nBut that's the charm of Johnston. It's a quiet, friendly place where everyone knows everyone, and life moves at a slower pace. It may not be flashy, but it's home.",
            "My ears first heard whispers of this place while listening to a podcast about vanished souls. It was a bit of a shocker, really. Every apartment around here goes for over a thousand dollars a month, you know? I'd never heard a peep about any missing persons, and neither had any of my buddies. Maybe it's the struggle, the daily grind. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, worried about making ends meet. Things are pricey, but we've learned to be clever with our money over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty charm of second-hand toys and clothes that have seen better days. You lose that new car smell pretty fast in adulthood. Maybe you pick up a habit like smoking, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But the flea market, oh, that place always calls back to you. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, clinging to the leather even after a good wash.   \n\nThere are three thrift stores within walking distance here. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and a quirky little curio shop. Downtown is bustling, cars and people pouring into the streets every morning, but those thrift stores? They're peaceful sanctuaries. No matter how many people or cars go by, the inside is quiet. It's a perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon. Every year, more and more people and cars seem to flood in. They say it's a developing city, growing pains and all. It reminds me a bit of New York, actually. Everyone here is focused on their own goals, and no one really expects much from you. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like back home, where showing a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into your life, not really. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city just keeps rolling on like waves on the beach. \n\nIt's a vibrant place to be, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we're less like strangers in an apartment building and more like a community of friends. We come together when we need to, for birthdays, funerals, to help each other out. I feel lucky to be here, truthfully. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them a little treat now and then, and they do the same for me. We bring each other mail, lend a hand when needed. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. \n\nI live in this massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "My neighbourhood, well, it's like a picture postcard of suburbia, you know?  Everything's so... neat.  The homeowner's association, they're like the invisible hand making sure everything's just so. Every house looks pretty much the same - a little patch of grass, some fancy rocks, a short driveway, maybe a little tree here and there.  And, of course, every house has a two-car garage. The roads are spotless, not a pothole in sight, all freshly paved.  Most are single-story, but you'll find some two-story ones sprinkled in.  \n\nNow, about the mailboxes -  they're not your typical kind. No individual boxes out front, no sir. It's more like an apartment building, a whole cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street. And there are these big lockers for packages too. Gotta love that HOA love for uniformity. \n\nSince my house sits on the edge of the city, our neighborhood's kind of a mix of country and suburb. We've got tons of space! There are community pools, all fancy and gated, and walking trails where you can take your dog or just go for a peaceful stroll. No need to go to a park for some exercise, you can just run around the neighborhood and get a good workout. \n\nMost folks here are retired, it's a really safe place, everyone looks out for each other. But there are some middle-aged and young professionals sprinkled in too. \n\nThe city itself is a bit of a paradox -  huge by population, but still feels small town cozy.  We've got most of the things you need, like that one mall - not huge, but it does the trick.  It's about a 15-minute drive to get anywhere interesting, but once you get there, there are tons of stores to choose from - fancy organic grocery stores, bargain outlets with just a handful of things and barely any staff... you name it. \n\nSo yeah, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, pretty typical, really.  We've got our community things like pools and trails, and while we're not right next to shopping, it's just a quick drive to anything you could want.",
            "My little corner of the world is a small town, just outside the big city buzz. It feels kinda like everyone knows each other here.  My street, on the east side, it's where the folks who don't have much money live. The houses are older, and most folks are renting. But you know what? It's not bad.  My neighbors, they're like family. Always a friendly wave and a hello when we pass each other.  Things happen, sometimes things get rough, but it's not like it's a scary place. There's been some drama, a few bad things, like shootings and stuff.  Our neighbors next door, they lost their boy last year.  It was heartbreaking.  Luckily, nothing too bad has ever happened to us directly.  Maybe something goes missing from the porch now and then, but that's about it.\n\nThis whole town, it's been hit hard by those \"opioid\" problems you hear about.  It's sad, folks losing their lives to that stuff. But there are good people here. They're trying to help. There are places where folks can get help with addiction, and folks are learning how to use that Narcan thing to save lives.  It's a tough situation, but people are trying.\n\nThere are a lot of good things here too. My son, he goes to a great school. The teachers and everyone there, they're amazing.  He's got special needs, but no one has ever bothered him. The school is so positive, he loves it there. We've got a strong parent group that always has fun events going on.  \n\nBecause so many families here struggle, the school makes sure every kid gets breakfast and lunch for free. No one ever has to worry about going hungry.  They don't judge anyone for not having a lot of money.  School stuff is also really affordable.  \n\nThe city folks have been working hard to make things look nicer.  They've fixed up the roads, planted flowers, and spruced up the parks.  But mostly, they've been focusing on the center of town, where the stores and restaurants are.  My side of town, it seems like it gets left behind sometimes.  That's a bummer, but I still like it here.  \n\nWe've been here for over 16 years. Our house isn't fancy, but it's home.  The people are kind, the schools are great, we've got everything we need, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a place with a story, ya know? Perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of times gone by. I live in a seven-story apartment building, right across from an old theater, its curtain still waiting for its next act. Just down the street, a cool little arcade bar draws in all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Come June and July, especially on weekends, you'll see a line stretching out the door, just buzzing with anticipation. A few blocks up, there's a city park, a green haven in the heart of it all. It's a decent size for this part of town, surrounded by concrete and these tall, sturdy stairs built right into the wall. In the winter, when the cold bites deep and the rain comes pouring down, you see them - folks without homes, setting up their tents in neat little rows along the sidewalk and those wide steps. They huddle close, seeking warmth in numbers,  closer to the city center than the wilderness. It's not far to the family center, either, where they can find a hot shower and a moment of peace.  But what I love most about this place, it's not the history etched into the buildings, the proud structures reaching for the sky or the way the architecture spills down the hills towards the ocean. No, it's the people. You see, Hilltop, once known as the most dangerous place on the West Coast, still carries the weight of its past. Stories linger, whispers passed down through generations, even three decades later, of the feds and the DEA sweeping through, trying to cleanse the streets. The people remember. \n\nThey work hard, even though folks still whisper about the rough edges of Hilltop. They care about their corner of the world, about keeping it clean, about keeping it theirs. Some folks say, \"Don't walk around Hilltop after dark if you're white,\" but I think that's just a shadow of the old days, a lingering echo of fear and prejudice. Maybe it's because I walk with a shade that blends in, or maybe Hilltop sees a kindred spirit in me, someone who knows the sting of prejudice, the weight of assumptions.  I know one thing: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. The streets pulse with a life that makes me feel alive. I've walked those streets in the dark, met people who'd offer me a jacket before they'd think to rob me. The laundromat owner left her store open late so I could charge my phone when the rain trapped me outside.  On the coldest nights, huddled in the shadow of a shop front, I felt invisible until someone stopped, looked me in the eye, and handed me five dollars, whispering, \"You're beautiful, you're valuable.\"  Hilltop is a place where kindness is a language everyone understands.",
            "My life unfolds in the heart of rural America, nestled amidst  the rolling farmland and charming tourist towns of small-town Michigan. It's a place where you won't find the bustling energy of big city malls, the familiar giants like Walmart or Target, or even a casual dining spot like Applebee's. Everything requires a little drive, a journey that takes you through the picturesque landscape.  But despite the lack of urban conveniences, I live in a slice of paradise, surrounded by the shimmering allure of water. My little town is cradled between the majestic Lake Michigan and the serene beauty of Lake Charlevoix. Every direction you turn, you'll find a beach beckoning you to dip your toes into its cool embrace.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the true spirit of small-town living. Houses stand proudly, each with its own unique story, some boasting updated interiors while others retain their vintage charm. Basements, the kind you can peek into from the street, are a common sight, and the houses wear their colorful aluminum siding like badges of honor.  Here, you'll find a kaleidoscope of colors adorning the blocks, a testament to the individuality of its residents. Most homes have yards, spaces where children's laughter echoes as they bounce on trampolines or swing on playsets. Gardens bloom with vibrant flowers, and fences enclose furry companions, creating a tapestry of life and family. \n\nIt's a neighborhood that reflects the heart of Middle America, a place where hard-working folks strive to build a life for themselves and their families. The streets are alive with the joyful sounds of children playing, dogs barking, and the rhythmic whir of bikes and rollerblades. The sense of community is tangible; neighbors greet each other with waves and smiles, forming a network of support and familiarity.  \n\nThe lawns are meticulously maintained, free from the clutter of fallen leaves and boasting emerald green grass.  Gardens are meticulously pruned, and bushes are trimmed to perfection, creating an atmosphere of order and care. This isn't a neighborhood that boasts ostentatious mansions, but a place that whispers, \"welcome home.\" It's a haven where families feel safe and secure, a place to put down roots and watch your children grow.\n\nJust a stone's throw away, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, a symbol of security and order.  The Health department is a close neighbor, ensuring the well-being of the community.  The recycling center stands ready to serve the needs of residents. \n\nThe sound of baseball games fills the air as children and adults alike enjoy the thrill of the game. Nearby, the small town airport hums with activity, the rumble of planes taking off and landing a constant reminder of the world beyond.  A local ice cream parlor beckons with its sweet aroma, and a short stroll takes you to the heart of downtown.  My children can ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away, where they can spend hours of carefree joy."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city is a real melting pot, you know? It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle with all these different pieces fitting together in a crazy way.  Living here is like being on a never-ending adventure. You've got your residential pockets scattered all over the place, tucked in between shops and restaurants and offices.  It's like a feast for the senses, with new places popping up all the time. \n\nWe've got those big, fancy stores that everyone knows, but then there are these hidden gems, these little boutiques that just make you want to pop in. They're everywhere, even on quiet streets you wouldn't expect, adding a touch of magic to the everyday.  And don't even get me started on the parks! They're always filled with families, kids running around, having fun. It's heartwarming to see. \n\nSpeaking of diverse, this place is bursting with different cultures.  Right here in my neighborhood, you've got your LGBTQ+ folks, a tight-knit Orthodox Jewish community, and even folks who have made their way here from the old Soviet Union. It's like a little world within a world.  \n\nAnd if you venture a little further out, you'll find even more communities, like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia... they're all just a stone's throw away, but sometimes getting there feels like a journey. Traffic can be a nightmare, especially during rush hour.  You can drive for miles and miles, but it might only take you a few blocks.\n\nIt's funny, though, because even with all this traffic, everyone seems to be adding more buildings to the city.  New apartment blocks are springing up everywhere, but some people are starting to worry that it's getting too crowded.\n\nBut hey, there's something for everyone here. You've got your big apartment buildings, your cozy houses, even duplexes.  It's all mixed up, just like the people who live here.\n\nI've lived here my whole life, but I still feel like I'm constantly meeting new people.  It's not exactly a tight-knit community anymore, but that's okay. It's still exciting, always something new to discover. Maybe that's the beauty of city life, always keeping you on your toes.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a quirky little slice of America, ya know? Most of the houses are like those classic single-family ones, but some folks split 'em up, making two homes out of one, still attached like twins. My place has got a little patch of grass out front and a teeny driveway, just enough for one car. It's like a picture postcard from a bygone era, back when the American dream meant living in the suburbs.  Back then, it felt like everyone was chasing that dream, but now, it's like the dream's drifting away, getting harder to hold onto. \n\nBut my neighborhood, it's still holding strong, whispering that the dream's still out there, just gotta keep reachin' for it. Folks ain't as hopeful as they used to be, the lawns ain't as manicured, but you still see a couple cars in most driveways, and the kids, they're running wild, like the world's their playground. There's this old school, been around for nigh on 90 years, still standing tall, givin' kids a glimpse of the future, while the old folks reminisce about their own school days. Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts? Packed! All the houses look different, but they all feel the same, like they're part of the same story.\n\nWe got this big supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by this big, friendly Yemeni family, they're probably the only Arab folks around here. Most folks are African American, generations deep, with stories about when everyone knew everyone.\n\nThere used to be a karate school, but when those Karate Kid movies went outta style, kids lost interest, so now it's a pharmacy. Guess they figured pills were the new kung fu, huh? Then there's this tiny movie theater, showing oldies for cheap.  Too old-fashioned for the young folks, but the older folks love it, a night out without all the hustle and bustle.\n\nWe got this expressway runnin' through town, but the on and off ramps are just outside our borders. Tried to get an exit, young folks wanted it, but the old-timers said it'd ruin our town. They got their way, kept things just the way they were. Now they're buildin' a new high school, and we're tryin' to pick a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a Southern drawl and a log cabin would sum up our town pretty good.",
            "Hmm...you might just miss it at first glance, this little corner tucked behind the shops. Not the kinda place you'd think folks would want to call home, not at first. But pry past the old, dusty Whole Foods and past the hotels that mostly sit empty, save for a few family get-togethers in the summer, and you'll stumble onto a whole world buzzing with life.  It's like a secret society, these streets and these apartment complexes huddled together like a bunch of Russian nesting dolls, all taken apart and laid out in a line.  You'll see some complexes that've been in the news for some not-so-nice stuff, so let's not dwell on those, yeah? Appearances can be deceiving. But the ones next to those, the ones beside those, those are a whole other story, a world most folks around here never even know about.\n\nJust across from those complexes, you've got this community college, a little branch campus. Quiet as a mouse, it is, with students shuffling in, coffee in hand, yawning like it's the end of the world at seven in the morning. The iron gates creak open for them one by one, while folks rushing to work shake their fists and grumble about them slowing things down on busy days. The road just kinda forks off into another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehab center for folks who've had a few… mishaps. The rehab center's got these cheerful porch chairs and a ceiling fan that goes round and round, pushing the thick summer air back and forth.\n\nKids are running around in the park, cartwheeling and spinning like crazy in the grass, while bees buzz around the flowers by the road. Old folks walk their dogs, grumbling at the teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the girls gossiping by the playground, talking about boys and YouTube videos. There's a sushi place in a strip mall by the park, cheap eats but never too crowded. Right beside that's a swimming supply store, and tucked in between them is a nail salon. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat hibachi chicken all at once. That's the magic of a strip mall, you know?\n\nAnd there's a frozen yogurt place there too, the kind where you build your own concoction. You see the kids from the park all the time, holding their cold, dripping cups of yogurt, doing skateboard tricks and puffing away on vapes because they think it makes them look cool.\n\nThis whole neighborhood is a slice of America, a little piece of history frozen in time down here in the sleepy south, where not even time itself seems to rush.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the endless cornfields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she wouldn't believe how simple and open everything was. She was used to living in a town where everything was just a short walk away, she'd never seen this much space in her life. Overwhelmed by all the corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we continued down this two-lane country road, we came to a quarry filled with water. Just past it was the little development where I live. The houses are mostly built with brick and stucco, and each one has at least half an acre of land that everyone takes pride in keeping up. In the springtime, there are flowers everywhere, along with the Midwestern trees that change color with each season.  All the driveways are filled with fancy Mercedes Benz cars that gleam in the sunlight after a good wash.\n\nDriving further down the road towards my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly smile. He spends the whole day mowing his lawn and you can hear him singing over the sound of the mower. Everyone in the neighborhood thinks it's funny, but he's such a good guy with a really interesting story. He's getting older now and isn't quite as sharp as he used to be. Back in the day, he was a doctor, and now he blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese roam around and are chased by our terrier. In the back, there's a little stream that flows into the quarry.  Here you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and sometimes even a \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge is a peaceful oasis filled with trees, herbs, and wildflowers that grow naturally. This is where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to chasing animals (mostly just chasing them!), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood friend to play with.\n\nThe winters in my small town can be really tough, but they're also beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green to a bare wilderness. The trees that were once covered in colorful flowers become bare skeletons of bark. When it snows, which it does sometimes, everything turns into a winter wonderland overnight. The backyard is filled with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I used to fight a lot when we were kids, and in the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We'd build huge igloo-like forts to store our weapons, usually sticks and branches, like we were in a secret army. In our own little winter wonderland, we played pretend and forgot about everything else. We were just kids, free and happy.",
            "Hmm...let me tell you about Portland, Oregon, this place with a unique kind of \"weirdness\". You'll see it everywhere, even on the side of a building that's part pizza joint, part bar, part music venue, part strip club...you get the picture.  They say \"Keep Portland Weird\" there, like it's a promise.  Some folks, they remember the old Portland, back when it was still hidden away and affordable. That's the Portland that birthed all the creative, quirky subcultures. Others, well, they see it as an invitation - come to Portland, where being different is a good thing, something to celebrate.  Even with all those fancy Californians moving in and those shiny new condos popping up everywhere, Portland still holds onto that weirdness.\n\nBut what exactly does \"weird\" mean here? It's not about being totally accepting of everything, no. It's about accepting the things that might make others raise an eyebrow. It's about knowing that we still have all the modern conveniences and the same everyday struggles as anywhere else. Sure, we buy most of our stuff from China, just like everyone else. There are a million ways to be different, to not fit in, and Portland has plenty of those. \n\nYou'll find yoga studios, hipsters, and suits working in offices here, just like anywhere else. Maybe \"weird\" just means we take it all a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, and in lots of others, you'll see houses painted in all sorts of bright colors, gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and even free boxes lining the sidewalks. These boxes, well, they're a Portland tradition. They're filled with treasures - clothes, books, sometimes even something completely unexpected. It's like a little surprise waiting for you around every corner.  \n\nThat magical feeling of discovering something special in the most ordinary places, that's what Portland is all about to me. At least, that's my version of weird. I know there are thousands of other kinds of weird here. Some folks wouldn't dream of taking anything out of a box on the street. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yes, you read that right!) or cheer on the Timbers soccer team. Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things, dream big, or at least dream about dreaming big while sipping a pint at the local pub. \n\nWe're not perfect, though. Like anywhere else, we have our struggles. Portland has a drug problem, and it's hard not to see the connection between that and the mental health issues that often go hand in hand. The constant rain and gray skies probably don't help either. And then there's the issue of homelessness, a problem that seems to plague every city. Portland tries to help, but our programs aren't enough.  Some people here are compassionate, while others just give up hope. Honestly, that's not so weird, is it? It's just part of being human.",
            "The mountains, they've always been there, like silent guardians watching over everything. Northward, they stand tall, witnessing every sunrise and sunset, unmoved by the hustle and bustle of life. Even when I'm caught up in my studies or work, they're still there, solid and unwavering. On days when stress weighs heavy on me, they seem to call out, demanding to be seen. And when I turn to them, they offer a calming presence, a source of strength to carry on, one day at a time.\n\nIt all started when I first moved here for university. The mountains north of campus captured my heart immediately. The university itself has its own beauty – the buildings, the ponds, the trees – each holding a special place in my memory. But the mountains, they rule them all.  \n\nThe town itself is a charming mix of the familiar and the unexpected. There are countless cafes where I spent countless hours fueled by coffee and late-night study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where faded brick buildings whisper stories of a bygone era. It's here that the town pulses with a vibrant energy, almost as if it's trying to outshine its bustling city neighbor. But just a few blocks away, you can escape back to the peaceful charm of small-town life, passing by the library on your way. This beautiful contrast, this close proximity of two distinct atmospheres, gives the town a magical quality, inviting you to explore its every nook and cranny.\n\nIt's a town where memories are made, both cherished and bittersweet. There's the rusty swing set in the park, where friends and I would congregate after all-nighters, or the frantic dash through the downtown area to catch a movie at the fancy theater thanks to a student discount. But like all places, it holds its share of painful memories too. The ponds, especially, seem to be a magnet for introspection and tearful confessions at 2 a.m. during existential crises – an experience I've had more times than I care to admit.\n\nWhile watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each with their own purpose, I couldn't help but question my own path. I walked past the pond, the park, the houses that screamed suburbia, until I found myself on a main street. As I walked, the sun bathed the palm trees in its golden light, painting the sky with vibrant hues. Looking up, I realized I was heading north. And there they were, as steadfast as ever. The mountains, majestically towering above everything else, their presence a silent reminder of my own strength and perseverance.",
            "My, oh my, if you ever find yourself planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it!  Getting around is a breeze, especially with the awesome public transportation, you know, one of the big things in New York City.  Bensonhurst has a real city vibe, so you'll be smack-dab in the heart of it all.  \n\nAnd speaking of vibes, get ready for a real sensory experience! You'll see these amazing Asian stores everywhere you look. In the last twenty years or so, Bensonhurst has become a real melting pot, especially with all the Asian folks moving in.  It's like every block has an Asian-owned store, you'll be spoiled for choice! Supermarkets and laundromats seem to be the most popular, and they're a hit with everyone, not just the Asian community. The food in the supermarkets is top-notch, the prices are super reasonable, and let's be honest, it's just so darn convenient. I mean, I live right near a cluster of four Asian supermarkets, all within a couple of minutes walking distance! Talk about convenience!\n\nBut don't think Bensonhurst is all about one culture, oh no! It's a real mix of people, with immigrants, and their kids who are first and second generation Americans, all living together.  While most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, there's a cool new park nearby that's got something for everyone. Ten basketball courts, a huge field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for the little ones, even a water fountain to cool off in the summer. It's a true melting pot, with people from all walks of life hanging out and getting along.\n\nAs for buildings, you won't find too many big, corporate towers here. Mostly, it's co-op buildings and condos. The majority of peeps live in these cute two-family houses, though.  The people here are generally nice, but can be a bit noisy, if you catch my drift.  Cars blasting music as they drive by,  people revving their engines in the morning...it can wake you right up! If you're planning to be out at night, keep your wits about you.  Bensonhurst is pretty safe, but you never know when you might run into some troublemakers, bullies, or even thieves. I've been through some things here myself, a few run-ins in the past, nothing too bad, but it's good to be aware. \n\nAnother thing, there's been a bit of a package theft problem lately.  Not a good look, right?  And while New York City has rules about cleaning up after your dog, some folks don't seem to get the memo.  Every morning, you'll probably see at least one piece of dog waste on your way to the train or the supermarket.  It's a real pet peeve of mine, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood is a peculiar place, perched precariously on the highest hill in town. People call it the \"workout hill\" because all the runners love to challenge themselves with its steep incline. The lack of sidewalks forces everyone to walk on the road, which is cracked and uneven in spots, making it a bit of a bumpy ride. The power lines strung across the street tell a story of their own, tattered and patched together after countless encounters with falling branches and storms.  \n\nEverywhere you look, towering evergreen trees stand sentinel.  But here's the funny thing - folks around here despise them! They're always trying to chop them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are built high up on the hill, with giant second stories boasting glass walls, desperately trying to catch a glimpse of the bay.\n\nSunsets are breathtaking, though. The water shimmers like liquid gold, and the sky explodes in a blaze of orange. Most days, though, the clouds steal the show, shrouding everything in a soft, damp haze. Moss thrives in this dampness, clinging to roofs, cars, even railings. Once, I left my car parked for a month, and it emerged looking like a furry green monster - three hours of scrubbing later, it was finally clean.\n\nKids are a rare sight in our neighborhood.  There's a school just a few blocks away, but it's mostly populated by retired folks.  Dogs, on the other hand, are everywhere. You'll find them lounging on lawns, chasing each other down the street, or sometimes, even sneaking into your house if you leave a door open!  I once found one in my living room, patiently waiting for a treat.\n\nRabbits also roam freely, much to the annoyance of gardeners who find their burrows digging up precious plants. But my cats are thrilled, having hunted most of them out of our yard.  We also have our fair share of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle, who often get chased away by the resident crows.\n\nThere aren't any stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood.  The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can easily see the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "Hmm... life here is kinda like one of those slow-moving movies, you know?  I live on this little street in a sleepy town down south, kinda tucked between two busy highways.  So, we get our fair share of traffic, nothin' too wild though. It's a pretty quiet neighborhood, most folks here have lived here for ages, so we all know each other pretty well.  It's the kind of place where everyone's busy with their own thing - tending to their yards, running errands, that kinda stuff.   \n\nWe live on the corner, so we get a front-row seat to all the neighborhood action. We know all the cars that go by, and if somethin' new rolls up, well, we take notice.  Some folks like to take walks, others walk their dogs, and the kids, they're always whizzing around on their bikes.  \n\nMy wife and I work from home, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen, are always underfoot. We're pretty much homebodies, so everyone's used to seeing us come and go. We love to play outside, even when it's drizzling, and we'll fire up the grill on our back deck whenever we get the chance.  It's like an unspoken rule - you gotta smell that barbecue at least once a week! \n\nThere's nothin' but trees around here, it used to be all woods, so we've got plenty of shade, but that means a whole lot of leaves come Fall. Raking and burning leaves is practically a family tradition. That smoky smell just screams \"Autumn\" to me, you know?\n\nThis year, we haven't had much of a winter at all, just a long, drawn-out Fall.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we only use the front door for company, which isn't often.\n\nI like to tinker in the garage with my truck or other projects, and when the doors are open, I feel like I'm more connected to the whole neighborhood. Holidays are a little more lively - Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas - folks come visit and the street gets crowded with cars.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty good life here.  If it weren't for that through-street traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where it's dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably don't get it. Like, you just don't understand the feeling of seeing brown everywhere you look. And when you do see a lawn, you know that person is dropping serious cash on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first lived here, the houses were spread out like they were trying to escape each other. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a bunch of new places popping up. Honestly, it's starting to feel more like a city every day, but I guess that's happening everywhere, right?\n\nMost of the people here are really friendly, just like in any place, you have your ups and downs. But in my part of town, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so it's a pretty nice place to be.\n\nThe stores around here are mostly the chain kind, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for something upscale, you gotta drive a bit. Never see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here. \n\nBased on what I see, the biggest industry in town is construction. I think that's because the city is still growing. There are still tons of wide-open spaces waiting to be built on.  It kinda freaks me out, actually. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city, and I'm not looking to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living – drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nOne of the things I love about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert itself is definitely a big draw. The high desert climate and landscape have created some pretty amazing ecosystems that need protecting. We share this space with all sorts of awesome creatures, and it's important that we learn about them so we can live together peacefully.\n\nMy family and I have gotten pretty good at coexisting with the wildlife. I have three kids, and they're obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. They're out there right now, trying to catch all sorts of interesting critters.\n\nAs for things to do around here, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert in a different way.  If you're visiting, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a ton of fun, and it really captures the Victorville spirit.  \n\nYou can also head up to nearby Wrightwood to see the snowy mountains and even take a winter sports lesson. \n\nIf you're interested in learning about the history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit. They have all sorts of cool stuff – geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how Victorville came to be.",
            "Hmm...my heart n soui went to Taiwan last Thursday,on the 1st to be precise. Im going to miss him and it has only been a day and yet here I am looking at his photo... again and again as if the world is going to come tumbling down.  Yup...his job is kinda time constraining,him an officer in the army ... I have to live with that for the rest of my life. Yet, I am happy with him. There's chemistry and we could talk about anything from weapons,politics or even the simple terminology of self reflection. I feel safe with him...maybe he is my knight n shinning armour who  has come to save me amidst the confusion. He was so sweet,the day he called me before he flew off, he said ' In any decision that you are going to make, I will say yes to it all,I wiil support you and at the end of the day, I will always be there for you,' I almost cried when he said that, Ive been waiting for someone to tell me that.  Dear Khai,my knight and shinning armour, come back to me when your job is done...   Untukmu Khai  Untukmu Ku saluti benang-benang sutera, menjadi perhiasan setiap pereka, menjadi keinginan si dara jelita, menjadi rebutan si putera raja... Setiap lirikan mata, Setiap gerak geri bicara, Ku perkemaskan tenunan, Ku halusi perasaan, Lalu,dengan perlahan redup matamu ku perhatikan, Lalu aku relakan... mereka istana pasir, dari embun-embun kasih.  - 3.4.2004                  tired...the whole day in school was spend in meetings. A friend of mine sms me saying that he had just came back from a short getaway. At first I was so relieved that he message me...then again. Believing in your feelings can really be difficult...especially when the other party does not feel the same way.To cross a friends path thats another issue...hmm,did some surfing on the net,discovered some beautiful poems.  This poem captured my heart,it goes on like this,  A Dream within a Dream by Edgar Allen Poe   Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem That my days have been a dream; Yet, if Hope has flown away In a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it, therefore, the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.  I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?  Been thinking of a certain someone that I really like...once upon a time. When everything was so  colourful, the air was sweet, the trees were beautiful...hmm.Thinking that it was meant to last forever n ever. Indeed, it only existed in fairy tales.True enough.                 Yesterday, the 4 of us went to Bukit Batok, me, my sis, ayu n hanip. We went to meet Keris, they were feeling kinda of down. Pity them. After that, we went and have a drink at Mas Ayu wif the other Kelana guys. Hmm...ayu cracking jokes about Talib, all the way from Bukit Batok to Mas Ayu. We were out control...giggling and laughing our hearts out throughout the journey. Irony.  I woke up late this morning. Marking my karangan...the neverending ordeal. After this, Im suppose to meet my P6EM3. I just realise how happy I am. although Im shoudering a lot of responsibilities.   The other day, my sis saw Khai, presuming with his wife. Hmm...life, what can I say. Yet, the bigger picture is, trust, guys and marriage. Marriage is a huge responsibility... a commitment. Nevertheless, when to think of it back, everything make sense. Maybe, it was a good thing in getting to know him, yup...he hurt me, but if we were to look at it at another perspective, he had hurt his partner even more, the trust. Me, being the third party. Retribution, I do not want to see it coming. I love my dear Hanip so much. Even to think of it, will make me sick. Then again, if it is meant to be...then be it. In life we have to be strong in tackling problem. It can be him and it can be me. He told me,  feelings can change, which is terribly true.     2.55 pm   Just finish cutting the tickets, the alignment has gone haywired. Ismail has been bugging me on the tickets. Hmm...Im searching for the C.C chop, I misplaced it , somehow. Im tired. My eyes are tired. Im tired. Ismail asked me whether they can use the mirror room. I try to see what I can do.    5.55 pm  Hmm...at de spur of moments, things can change. Now, Im feeling restless. Sad.   ' Which is one is better, 3 years or one n a half year...'  I think it is better if it is 3 years, then I won't be leaving in denial.  An everlasting commitment... ' the person can be me or you...' it can be Me or you...  &nbsp;     Kris Dayanti & Ajai          After reading my previous post, it lead me to think, saya ni orangnya berjiwang-jiwang. Hmm...enough of that sweetness in the air, the cloud nine, the everlasting cotton wool and being dragged back to the ground. Yesterday was the MAEC meeting, yup...we are going to have the gigantic group around...its not confimed yet but then again the glitters that we see in their eyes...can outshine the indoor stadium,hmm,im just exaggerating huh..     My sis and I decided to stay on because of these words...' We wont be in the CC, without you guys around,' hmm...so touched by what my dear bro Ayu had to say. And again we decided to stay on because of our dear ...Mr Zahidi Rahman, our supportive chairman. He actually begged us to stay. Thus,this year the first project is sponsored by the Heritage Centre with the help of us the MAEC.  Yup...the outlining of the budget, the Arts, and the most important thing the objective. For Mega Perdana...I don't really care. Mega Perdana had already been auction for the mere of $5,000. The so called Chairman is responsible for this.   Therefore, Singapore expect the next ala Gentarasa or even a bigger event to be truly organised by MAEC Siglap South and the Giants... Yesterday, Rizal called, he told me to write lyrics for the group. The theme, hmmm...something to do with Paruh... belum berilham hamba...  13 days to go, Khai. : )   'Love is not a matter of counting the years... it's making the years count.  --Wolfman Jack Smith                 yesterday was a very tiring and long day...woke up late to school. Hmm...had our Malam Anugerah Dikir 2004 penilaian...everyone was there.The emotional part was seeing them,the so called ' orang lama of the dikir barat world ' together after long years apart. Today,got an email... procedures on the registration to enrol on a degree programme in UM .still thinking,got the green light from my family.hmm...maybe I should enrol,there's nothing much left for me here,macam sedih gitukan... My friend told me, have you ever heard of the story about the Science teacher and her jar, the science teacher,put a few golf ball inside the jar,still its not full,the she put in some pebbles,followed by sand and the water. Then she said, in life we have to priorities,who are the golf balls,who symbolizes the sands and so on and so forth.The golf balls are people that are dear to you,people who meant a lot to you,the sand and the water symbolizes the so not important people,those that you can live without.Look here she said,you have to put the golf balls first,not the sand or the water.If you were to put the water first,you cannot put your golf balls...put the golfballs,then the pebbles,then the sand...then the water,you have to know. True...my families are my golf balls...the people that are dear to you.A friend told me that I kept making these stupid mistakes due to the fact that Im lonely, ehheheeh..more of a pathetic twisted personality. Now,Im a bit focus,confident tak tau asal...mungkin dah penat...mungkin. Adakah yang benar itu benar...tidak benar.                    Im hurting again...that's the irony part,I don't know why I am feeling this way. I can feel my heart bleeding thou...its happening again.Yup...as if a knife,slowly piercing deep through me. Yesterday, I went out with him and he brought up the issue of one of the gerl's group. I was so pissed off... yup... I totally lose control and the worse part, it was only like  30%  of my anger... bursting...it was not a full blast,then again.. it did make an impact.I kind of settled in when he crack some jokes about the boriah tingy...hmm,he is sweet...very sweet.  Guess what...7 new messages.Hmm...so many people I've blocked from my msn.Missed chatting with Shariffah aka yan, been busy lately...hmmm...  Again, let us analyse what the hell am I suffering from...is it an infectious or contagious disease...heheheeh, maybe I need to rest for another month or was it a pure act of jealousy..nah,that would be the last thing.... then again, maybe if you love the person too much, I would just like to imagine him being wrapped up neatly,in a package,put it in my closet,far away from all the girls as possible.At one point,I tend to become restless,twitchy and uneasy when he mentioned to me about his x.Im not a paranoid.To look at my past, I do have loads of Xs but then was then. Perhaps,Ive never been ditch before.The feeling must be overwhelming.Hmm...sad to say this,I think he still loves his x...that's it!! I couldn't sleep because I think he has feelings for his x. I feel terrible now...inferiority lurkes again. What a jughead, how can I not see this.. thats why I am feeling miserable..it has nothing to do with that masked man... Shucks...hmmm...jiwa retak pulak saya ni... Hai...how love can makes you a desperado and defy the norms.merepeknyelah saya...: ) Im listening to... Ada Apa Dengan Cinta...apa nak jadi hafidah,yeah...away feminisme and what is left of it...                     Guess what...a fren of mine by the name of Zai called, he hated when I call him that, the kelkatu man.heheeh,hmm...he sounded suprise. He asked me, ' Do you know that .....in your CC,' I said ' Yeah,Ive discussed it with Ayu,' The matter of the fact was, I dont really care...I mean the C.C stuff and more...Im in cloud nine you see and the only thing I can think off when Im marking and stuff like that is to think about my dear Khai in Taiwan.Has he eaten,taken his bath or the most important thing does he look at the stars every night and think of me, like I think of him.ehehhe.    The irony part here, is that Ive known him...what like nearly two months perhaps and the impact he gave me.I have to admit, the first time I met him,it was a mutual thing, a fren thing, like I meet my other frens. Then goes on to the next meeting plus the hours we hang on the phone.hmm...kita boleh bergayut berjam-jam.  Seldom people can just have the same chemistry bonding with me and the one that I want to be with is not just any Tom, Dick or Harry, he must be confident but at the same time humble... Any Tom, Dick or Harry can be found anywhere,under the drain,clubhouses,brushing their ego or just looking at themselves in the mirror and telling it straight to their face that they are big time losers.   Being in a relationship is not just uttering a few words like  I love you  or  I want you  , being true to each other,and to truly feel at lost when the other party is not around. Nevertheless,his picture or his last words somehow cure the emptiness inside.  I don't understand on how sometimes relationship is build on  a stupid lie. To be truthful is a responsibility to the loved ones.When you commit to someone, you don't only give your words...its more than that.     Something to digest ....Les Brown - I believe there are three kinds of people. There are winners, who know what they want and understand their potential and the possibilities. They take life on. Next are losers, who don't have a clue as to who they are. They allow circumstances to shape their lives and their self-image. I believe there is a third group as well. This consists of potential winners whose lives are just slightly out of alignment. I call them wayward winners...",
            "Hmm...my heart's been in Stockbridge for about 10 years now.  When I first got here from Riverdale, I'll admit, I had a good cry. Missing my old family and friends really hit me hard.  But my parents, they wanted the best for me and my little sister. A better place to live, a better school...you know, like they always say, \"a step up from the ghetto.\"  I guess over time, I got used to it all. Made some new friends, some people who just rubbed me the wrong way. I never really got close to the neighbors though, except for Mr. Glen and his kids.  And Dennis for a little while. They're like family to me, I'm really grateful for them.\n\nRemember that time we went to Mr. Glen's wedding?  He and Ms. Veda tied the knot again. It was a blast!  I caught the little white strap she took off her leg, but I missed the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I had a real good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing great!\n\nThis neighborhood can be a bit of a puzzle, but with my GPS, I'm exploring more. Mostly, I hang out with my buddies Kason and Curtis.  We used to be glued to the video games, just living it up. Sometimes I'd head to the park, just to soak up some nature. It really calms me down.  Makes me feel at peace. I might bring some sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, maybe even my bokken if I can. It's just fun to do the things I love.  \n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court there too, even though I haven't touched a racket or a ball in ages.  Still nice to have around, you know, just in case I feel like playing again. My dad and Mr. Graves, they really got me and my best friend hooked on tennis back in the day. We had a blast! They pushed us hard, but it was always fun.\n\nThere are so many good times here, so many stories.  These are just the ones that really stick with me.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is just a hop, skip and a jump from my college, which is super convenient.  Most of the buildings are apartments, but there are a few restaurants and bars sprinkled around that are fun to hang out at without breaking the bank. One bar just got a fancy new name, but it's a bit pricier now.  The drinks aren't bad, but the service is kind of meh.  Mostly, you'll find college kids and folks who are on a tight budget living here,  since the apartments aren't too expensive. There are a ton of kids around too because there's an elementary school just a stone's throw away.  I don't really know my neighbors, and honestly, I'm kinda okay with that. They have a bit of a penchant for marijuana, so the building management put one of those air freshener things right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I thought was hilarious - kinda rude, but funny.  \n\nThe buildings around here are a bit old-fashioned, though some have been spruced up inside.  Down the street, there are these brand new apartment buildings, but I'm not a fan.  They feel kinda cheap and flimsy, but the rent is super high - a total rip-off, in my opinion.  I guess they can get away with it because they're close to campus. \n\nThere's this super cheap eats place just five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates. Everything is microwaved, but hey, it gets the job done.  Across the street is a gas station that doesn't have a great reputation.  But last summer, they redid the road with city money, so now there's a nice wide sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area is looking a bit nicer.  My apartment building is tucked away behind some trees, though they did chop down a few. I guess they're trying to open things up. \n\nBehind my complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind is 43rd Street, and it's not as charming.  The sidewalks are crumbling, and most of the buildings look pretty rough around the edges. There are a lot of trees there too, probably to hide the not-so-pretty buildings. There's been a lot of crime in that area, mostly at one particular apartment complex, though it's not fair to blame them alone.  The apartments across the street from me are also a bit sketchy with a lot of turnover. \n\nOverall, though, I kinda like where I live. It's affordable, and I have everything I need nearby.  The best part is that my college is just a walk away, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood feels like a little slice of old-fashioned charm. It's made up of these cute duplexes, all tucked away on a quiet cul-de-sac. They're spaced out just enough so they look like individual houses, and they all have this sweet, matching look with their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs.  Most of the folks here are friends, and we often gather at the end of the driveways in the evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's so nice to have that sense of community, especially in this crazy, tech-driven world. It feels like stepping back in time.\n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees, with big blue skies and fluffy white clouds. It's picture-perfect, really.  The only downside lately has been the tornado warnings. Last night, we actually heard the sirens! So, there I was, tucked away in my bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows, just in case. My big dog wasn't as keen on the bathroom idea and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The whole neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail pounding on everything. It was pretty intense.  \n\nAfter the storm, the road seemed to be steaming from the temperature change. It went from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes! The hail melted instantly as it hit the hot pavement. As the clouds cleared, the sun came out and started pouring rain. And then, the most amazing thing happened: a double rainbow! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were just as awestruck as I was.\n\nThings calmed down after an hour or so, and people started trickling back home. It was back to normal pretty quickly - moms and kids out playing, dinner cooking.  It's a really friendly neighborhood, and I love it here.  \n\nI live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else.  They all look the same on the outside, but the insides are different. Some are surprisingly small, which I don't quite understand.  I love taking walks in the big field behind my place and heading down to the pond. It's not for swimming, but it's a great spot to see deer. In the morning, you can hear this giant bullfrog singing his heart out. It's a fantastic place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte.  \n\nEvery morning, we're greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like living in a little village. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that bray's in the evenings, letting us know he's around. I feel so lucky to have found this special place.",
            "Hmm...moving to this new place was right around the time I started eighth grade.  Making friends was tough at first, you know? But then I met this awesome guy who lives just two houses down, and another cool dude on my street.  They've moved on since then, but the memories are still there, like little treasures tucked away. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still around, just like those familiar faces in a favorite song.  It's a pretty typical neighborhood, like so many others you see in those movies, full of two-story houses and the sound of kids laughing and playing outside whenever the weather's nice. It's pretty quiet most days, which is kind of nice.\n\nI've never had any trouble with anyone here. People keep to themselves, which is cool.  You're left alone unless you need something, like if you need help moving a heavy box or something.  I've ordered a bunch of stuff online, and not once has anything gone missing from my porch.  It makes me feel safe, knowing I can trust the people around me.\n\nThere's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my house. We've got so many memories there, me and the guys.  We used to play basketball, football, even baseball.  I even got whacked in the nose playing football, which wasn't so fun, but hey, those good times definitely outweigh the bad ones. Now, when I go there, it's mostly to hang out with my cousins' kids. They're little, still into swings and slides and all that. Just thinking about going to the park makes their eyes light up, which is so sweet.  It brings back a whole lot of memories, you know?\n\nThe neighborhood's pretty diverse, which is awesome. You can find all kinds of food around here.  Within just a mile, you've got Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – everything! But these days, everyone seems to be ordering in with those apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.  The usual fast food places are everywhere, and there's always a pizza place on every corner.  \n\nThere are tons of stores, too, with everything you could possibly need.  Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, even a Jewel-Osco grocery store – it's like a mini-city! There's even an Indian store if you're in the mood for some homemade curry or ready-made samosas.\n\nLooking at what other people go through in their neighborhoods, it makes me really appreciate this place. It's a haven, a little slice of peace. I'm grateful to call it home.",
            "My town, Johnston, is a little slice of Southern charm, nestled in the heart of South Carolina. It might not be the flashiest place around, but it's got a special place in my heart, especially when it comes to peaches. You see, Johnston proudly wears the crown of \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title you'll see proudly displayed on the welcome sign.  \n\nEverywhere you look, it's a sea of green, dotted with peach trees and cattle pastures. The houses are mostly spread out, with two-story beauties sporting either metal roofs to beat the summer heat or classic gray shingles. They often sit back from the road, leaving plenty of space for fields and farm animals.\n\nThe heart of town is centered around a single, lonely stoplight at a four-way intersection. It's here you'll find the town's only stores, a testament to its small-town vibe. For a quick bite, you can choose from Hong Kong, a cozy Chinese joint run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a familiar burger chain. We used to have a pizza place, but it sadly closed up shop a while back. \n\nThere's a tiny, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for their delicious Cherry Coca-Cola. Then there's the Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), a bit pricey but the only grocery store for miles around. Most folks prefer to make the trip to Batesburg-Leesville for their weekly shopping spree at Walmart, though. \n\nThe real star of the show is hands down Dollar General. You can find everything you need there, and it's always bustling from opening to closing. There's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a sweet little shop run by a beloved local lady. They've been around forever and even offer delivery with their own movers! Tucked behind the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a full-service pet groomer with daycare and boarding options. \n\nBoth the doctor's office and the veterinary clinic are a bit off the beaten path, but they're well-equipped to take care of the townspeople. \n\nOur only elementary school is Johnston Elementary, but once kids finish fifth grade, they have to head to the next town over for middle and high school.  \n\nParks? Not so much. We're working on a 2.5-acre recreation area to give families a place to hang out and maybe lure in some new residents. But honestly, Johnston isn't exactly a bustling metropolis. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or trendy spots to hang. It's so small, you could practically drive through it without even noticing!  \n\nBut that's the charm of Johnston. It's a quiet, friendly place where everyone knows everyone, and life moves at a slower pace. It may not be flashy, but it's home.",
            "My ears first heard whispers of this place while listening to a podcast about vanished souls. It was a bit of a shocker, really. Every apartment around here goes for over a thousand dollars a month, you know? I'd never heard a peep about any missing persons, and neither had any of my buddies. Maybe it's the struggle, the daily grind. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, worried about making ends meet. Things are pricey, but we've learned to be clever with our money over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty charm of second-hand toys and clothes that have seen better days. You lose that new car smell pretty fast in adulthood. Maybe you pick up a habit like smoking, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But the flea market, oh, that place always calls back to you. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, clinging to the leather even after a good wash.   \n\nThere are three thrift stores within walking distance here. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and a quirky little curio shop. Downtown is bustling, cars and people pouring into the streets every morning, but those thrift stores? They're peaceful sanctuaries. No matter how many people or cars go by, the inside is quiet. It's a perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon. Every year, more and more people and cars seem to flood in. They say it's a developing city, growing pains and all. It reminds me a bit of New York, actually. Everyone here is focused on their own goals, and no one really expects much from you. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like back home, where showing a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into your life, not really. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city just keeps rolling on like waves on the beach. \n\nIt's a vibrant place to be, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we're less like strangers in an apartment building and more like a community of friends. We come together when we need to, for birthdays, funerals, to help each other out. I feel lucky to be here, truthfully. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them a little treat now and then, and they do the same for me. We bring each other mail, lend a hand when needed. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. \n\nI live in this massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "My neighbourhood, well, it's like a picture postcard of suburbia, you know?  Everything's so... neat.  The homeowner's association, they're like the invisible hand making sure everything's just so. Every house looks pretty much the same - a little patch of grass, some fancy rocks, a short driveway, maybe a little tree here and there.  And, of course, every house has a two-car garage. The roads are spotless, not a pothole in sight, all freshly paved.  Most are single-story, but you'll find some two-story ones sprinkled in.  \n\nNow, about the mailboxes -  they're not your typical kind. No individual boxes out front, no sir. It's more like an apartment building, a whole cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street. And there are these big lockers for packages too. Gotta love that HOA love for uniformity. \n\nSince my house sits on the edge of the city, our neighborhood's kind of a mix of country and suburb. We've got tons of space! There are community pools, all fancy and gated, and walking trails where you can take your dog or just go for a peaceful stroll. No need to go to a park for some exercise, you can just run around the neighborhood and get a good workout. \n\nMost folks here are retired, it's a really safe place, everyone looks out for each other. But there are some middle-aged and young professionals sprinkled in too. \n\nThe city itself is a bit of a paradox -  huge by population, but still feels small town cozy.  We've got most of the things you need, like that one mall - not huge, but it does the trick.  It's about a 15-minute drive to get anywhere interesting, but once you get there, there are tons of stores to choose from - fancy organic grocery stores, bargain outlets with just a handful of things and barely any staff... you name it. \n\nSo yeah, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, pretty typical, really.  We've got our community things like pools and trails, and while we're not right next to shopping, it's just a quick drive to anything you could want.",
            "My little corner of the world is a small town, just outside the big city buzz. It feels kinda like everyone knows each other here.  My street, on the east side, it's where the folks who don't have much money live. The houses are older, and most folks are renting. But you know what? It's not bad.  My neighbors, they're like family. Always a friendly wave and a hello when we pass each other.  Things happen, sometimes things get rough, but it's not like it's a scary place. There's been some drama, a few bad things, like shootings and stuff.  Our neighbors next door, they lost their boy last year.  It was heartbreaking.  Luckily, nothing too bad has ever happened to us directly.  Maybe something goes missing from the porch now and then, but that's about it.\n\nThis whole town, it's been hit hard by those \"opioid\" problems you hear about.  It's sad, folks losing their lives to that stuff. But there are good people here. They're trying to help. There are places where folks can get help with addiction, and folks are learning how to use that Narcan thing to save lives.  It's a tough situation, but people are trying.\n\nThere are a lot of good things here too. My son, he goes to a great school. The teachers and everyone there, they're amazing.  He's got special needs, but no one has ever bothered him. The school is so positive, he loves it there. We've got a strong parent group that always has fun events going on.  \n\nBecause so many families here struggle, the school makes sure every kid gets breakfast and lunch for free. No one ever has to worry about going hungry.  They don't judge anyone for not having a lot of money.  School stuff is also really affordable.  \n\nThe city folks have been working hard to make things look nicer.  They've fixed up the roads, planted flowers, and spruced up the parks.  But mostly, they've been focusing on the center of town, where the stores and restaurants are.  My side of town, it seems like it gets left behind sometimes.  That's a bummer, but I still like it here.  \n\nWe've been here for over 16 years. Our house isn't fancy, but it's home.  The people are kind, the schools are great, we've got everything we need, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a place with a story, ya know? Perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of times gone by. I live in a seven-story apartment building, right across from an old theater, its curtain still waiting for its next act. Just down the street, a cool little arcade bar draws in all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Come June and July, especially on weekends, you'll see a line stretching out the door, just buzzing with anticipation. A few blocks up, there's a city park, a green haven in the heart of it all. It's a decent size for this part of town, surrounded by concrete and these tall, sturdy stairs built right into the wall. In the winter, when the cold bites deep and the rain comes pouring down, you see them - folks without homes, setting up their tents in neat little rows along the sidewalk and those wide steps. They huddle close, seeking warmth in numbers,  closer to the city center than the wilderness. It's not far to the family center, either, where they can find a hot shower and a moment of peace.  But what I love most about this place, it's not the history etched into the buildings, the proud structures reaching for the sky or the way the architecture spills down the hills towards the ocean. No, it's the people. You see, Hilltop, once known as the most dangerous place on the West Coast, still carries the weight of its past. Stories linger, whispers passed down through generations, even three decades later, of the feds and the DEA sweeping through, trying to cleanse the streets. The people remember. \n\nThey work hard, even though folks still whisper about the rough edges of Hilltop. They care about their corner of the world, about keeping it clean, about keeping it theirs. Some folks say, \"Don't walk around Hilltop after dark if you're white,\" but I think that's just a shadow of the old days, a lingering echo of fear and prejudice. Maybe it's because I walk with a shade that blends in, or maybe Hilltop sees a kindred spirit in me, someone who knows the sting of prejudice, the weight of assumptions.  I know one thing: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. The streets pulse with a life that makes me feel alive. I've walked those streets in the dark, met people who'd offer me a jacket before they'd think to rob me. The laundromat owner left her store open late so I could charge my phone when the rain trapped me outside.  On the coldest nights, huddled in the shadow of a shop front, I felt invisible until someone stopped, looked me in the eye, and handed me five dollars, whispering, \"You're beautiful, you're valuable.\"  Hilltop is a place where kindness is a language everyone understands.",
            "My life unfolds in the heart of rural America, nestled amidst  the rolling farmland and charming tourist towns of small-town Michigan. It's a place where you won't find the bustling energy of big city malls, the familiar giants like Walmart or Target, or even a casual dining spot like Applebee's. Everything requires a little drive, a journey that takes you through the picturesque landscape.  But despite the lack of urban conveniences, I live in a slice of paradise, surrounded by the shimmering allure of water. My little town is cradled between the majestic Lake Michigan and the serene beauty of Lake Charlevoix. Every direction you turn, you'll find a beach beckoning you to dip your toes into its cool embrace.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the true spirit of small-town living. Houses stand proudly, each with its own unique story, some boasting updated interiors while others retain their vintage charm. Basements, the kind you can peek into from the street, are a common sight, and the houses wear their colorful aluminum siding like badges of honor.  Here, you'll find a kaleidoscope of colors adorning the blocks, a testament to the individuality of its residents. Most homes have yards, spaces where children's laughter echoes as they bounce on trampolines or swing on playsets. Gardens bloom with vibrant flowers, and fences enclose furry companions, creating a tapestry of life and family. \n\nIt's a neighborhood that reflects the heart of Middle America, a place where hard-working folks strive to build a life for themselves and their families. The streets are alive with the joyful sounds of children playing, dogs barking, and the rhythmic whir of bikes and rollerblades. The sense of community is tangible; neighbors greet each other with waves and smiles, forming a network of support and familiarity.  \n\nThe lawns are meticulously maintained, free from the clutter of fallen leaves and boasting emerald green grass.  Gardens are meticulously pruned, and bushes are trimmed to perfection, creating an atmosphere of order and care. This isn't a neighborhood that boasts ostentatious mansions, but a place that whispers, \"welcome home.\" It's a haven where families feel safe and secure, a place to put down roots and watch your children grow.\n\nJust a stone's throw away, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, a symbol of security and order.  The Health department is a close neighbor, ensuring the well-being of the community.  The recycling center stands ready to serve the needs of residents. \n\nThe sound of baseball games fills the air as children and adults alike enjoy the thrill of the game. Nearby, the small town airport hums with activity, the rumble of planes taking off and landing a constant reminder of the world beyond.  A local ice cream parlor beckons with its sweet aroma, and a short stroll takes you to the heart of downtown.  My children can ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away, where they can spend hours of carefree joy."
