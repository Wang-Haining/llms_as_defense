            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood in this big city is a real mix of everything! Houses and stores are scattered around, like someone just threw them down randomly. You've got your usual shops and restaurants, but there are always new places popping up. Some are big chains, but I see more and more little, independent stores opening up too. They're everywhere, even on quiet streets, which makes it fun to explore. There are a couple of parks nearby, and it's adorable to see families with little kids playing there.\n\nNow, the people here are just as diverse as the places. There's a whole LGBTQ+ community, a group of Orthodox Jews, and even a bunch of people who came here from the former Soviet Union, all in one little area. \n\nIf you go a bit further out, you'll find even more different cultures. There's Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and tons more, all within a short drive...though,  \"short\" can be a bit relative in this city! Traffic can be brutal, especially during rush hour, so a 10-mile drive can take forever. \n\nIt's funny, because everyone drives everywhere, but nobody walks. There are things to see and do nearby, but this city is huge! People just don't want to walk that far.  So, we've got some of the worst traffic in the world and parking is a nightmare.  \n\nAnd get this: even with all the traffic and parking problems, they keep building more apartments! It seems like everyone wants to live here, but some people are worried about even more people and cars crowding the streets.\n\nBut hey, not everyone wants to live in a giant apartment building.  There are tons of houses of all sizes,  duplexes, and smaller apartment complexes.  It's a mix of everything, just like the people!\n\nThere are all ages here too, and to be honest, I don't really know most of my neighbors. It's not like the tight-knit neighborhood I grew up in, where I spent all my time playing outside with my friends. Back then, we were practically inseparable.",
            "My neighbourhood, its a real character, ya know? Most of the houses are those big ol' single family ones, but some folks have split theirs up, like joining two houses together, but still keeping them separate. My place has a little patch of grass out front and a tiny driveway to the side. It's like a snapshot from a time when living in the suburbs was the big dream, the American dream, you understand? It felt like everyone was chasing it back then, but now, it's like the dream's kinda slipping away. \n\nBut my neighbourhood, and a whole bunch of others like it, they're still holding on. They're shoutin' out, \"Hey, the dream's still alive!\" We're clingin' to it with all we got. Folks ain't as bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as they used to be, the lawns ain't quite as perfect, but there's still cars parkin' in every driveway, and kids playin' like the world's their own playground.  \n\nThat old school, been standin' for almost 90 years, it's still there, makin' dreams for the young'uns and bringin' back memories for the old-timers.  Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always buzzin'. Each house looks different, but they all kinda feel the same, like they got that same old soul.\n\nWe got this big supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by this big Yemeni family, they might be the only ones from around there in the whole neighbourhood.

Most folks here have been here forever, got stories about the good ol' days when everyone knew everyone.\n\nUsed to be a karate school, but Hollywood stopped makin' those \"Karate Kid\" movies, so the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, guess drugs are the new craze. There's also this tiny movie theatre, shows old flicks for cheap. The young folks mock it, but the older folks love it, a night out without the kids, for a steal.\n\nWe got this one big highway runnin' through town, but the on-ramp and off-ramp are in the next town over. Back in the day, folks tried to get an exit here, but the young'uns wanted it, the old folks said it'd ruin the town, and well, they got their way. \n\nNow they're building a new high school, and we're tryin' to pick a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect fit for this place.",
            "Okay, so you might just breeze past this place, thinking it's nothin' special. It's tucked away behind some shops, not exactly the kind of spot you'd expect to find a whole community, ya know? But hang on, because if you sneak past the old, forgotten Whole Foods and wander behind those hotels that only get filled up once a year, maybe for family get-togethers, you'll stumble onto a whole world you never knew existed.  \n\nThere are these apartment buildings lined up like a bunch of Russian nesting dolls, all carefully taken apart and put back together in a row. Now, the first ones you see, they've been on the news for some shady stuff, so let's not dwell on those too much. But the ones next to them, and the ones after those, those are a whole different story. Almost nobody around here even knows they're there.  \n\nAcross from those apartments, you'll find a little community college branch - a quiet place with sleepy buildings, where students amble in with their coffee cups, yawning their way into the 7 AM morning. The iron gates creak open, letting them in one by one, while the commuters in their cars shake their fists and grumble about them holding up traffic on busy days. The road bumps into another residential street, with a park on one side and a place where people go to heal up after getting hurt. They call it a rehabilitation center, and it's got these cheerful porch chairs and a lazy ceiling fan that keeps the warm summer air moving. \n\nKids are running around in the park across the street, cartwheeling and spinning like crazy, while bees buzz around the flower patches by the road. Old folks walk their dogs, grumbling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls hanging out by the swings, chatting about boys and the latest TikTok trends.  There's a sushi place in a strip mall next to the park, with cheap eats but never too crowded. Right beside it is a swimming supply store, and stuck in between is a nail salon. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, and grab some hibachi chicken, all in one go – that's the beauty of a strip mall. There's even a frozen yogurt place there, the kind where you build your own sundae, and you see the teens from the park all the time, holding their cold, drippy cups of frozen yogurt while they try out tricks on their skateboards and puff away on their vapes, thinking they look super cool.  \n\nThis whole neighborhood, it's like a snapshot of America, a little piece of history in the sleepy south where things just stay the same, even time seems to slow down.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked, her voice tinged with wonder as we drove past endless rows of cornfields.  I knew she wouldn't understand this vast expanse. She came from a town where the grocery store was a stone's throw away, where life was a constant buzz of activity.  I smiled, taking her hand. \"This is it,\" I said, letting her feel the quiet hum of the countryside.\n\nShe gaped at the horizon, her eyes wide with a mixture of awe and disbelief. It was in these stretches of quiet, under the watchful gaze of the cornfields, that I truly felt at home. I told her stories of my childhood here in Ohio, of the summers filled with fireflies and the winters blanketed in snow. I painted pictures with my words, sharing the rhythm of life in a place where time seemed to move a little slower.\n\nWe passed a quarry, its water shimmering like a jewel in the sun. Just beyond it, nestled amongst the rolling hills, was my neighborhood. Brick and stucco homes, each with a sprawling yard, lined the roads.  People took pride in their gardens, bursting with color in the spring and autumn. Shiny Mercedes Benzes, gleaming after a good wash, lined the driveways, a testament to the success of those who called this place home.\n\nA friendly face greeted us as we neared my house. My Korean neighbor, a retired doctor, was always out tending his lawn, humming a tune as his mower hummed. We all loved his quirky ways, his sunny disposition never faltering, even as time etched lines on his face.  He was a reminder that life, despite its challenges, could still be filled with simple joys.\n\nMy house stood at the end of a quiet lane, its grey stucco walls blending with the surrounding landscape. Geese honked in the side yard, chased playfully by our energetic terrier.  In the backyard, a small stream gurgled, its melody punctuated by the croaking of bullfrogs and the distant moo of cows.\n\nA hand-built wooden bridge crossed the stream, leading to a secret oasis. A haven of trees, herbs, and wildflowers, it was here that I spent countless hours as a child. Building forts, chasing squirrels, exploring the woods - it was a world of endless possibilities.\n\nWinter transformed the landscape into a stark, beautiful canvas. The vibrant greens faded, replaced by a tapestry of browns and grays. Snow blanketed the world, transforming the ordinary into something magical. My sister and I would build snow forts, armed with snowballs and laughter. We'd carve out igloos, our makeshift arsenals filled with branches, our imaginations running wild.\n\nThose winters were tough, but they were also filled with a special kind of magic.  The snow brought a sense of wonder, a reminder that even in the coldest of times, there was beauty to be found.\n\nWe were just kids then, lost in our own little world. We didn't know anything about the world beyond the snow-covered fields and our backyard haven. We just knew that we had each other, and that was all that mattered.",
            "Ah, Portland, Oregon... You gotta understand what \"weird\" truly means here. It's not just a quirky badge, it's woven into the very fabric of the city. This idea, you see, is immortalized on a building that somehow manages to be a pizza place, a bar, a music venue, a strip club, and probably a few other things that could land its owner in hot water.  It says, \"Keep Portland Weird.\"  Some folks, they see it as a nostalgic shout-out to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time before it became a hot spot for Californians with deep pockets and a fondness for high-rise condos. They remember a Portland that was more hidden, more affordable, a breeding ground for unique and amazing subcultures. Others, well, they hear it as a siren song, a beckoning to a place where weird isn't just tolerated, it's celebrated.  \n\nBut let me tell you, even with all those fancy new condos popping up and the influx of folks from across the bridge, Portland still holds onto its weird.  \n\nNow, weird doesn't mean everyone's always cool with everything. It doesn't mean we don't have our share of modern problems and modern conveniences, like everyone else. We buy our stuff from China, just like the rest of the country. There are a million ways to be weird, to be outside the norm, but Portland has plenty of \"normal\" too. We've got our yoga enthusiasts, our hipsters, our business folks, the whole shebang.  Maybe \"weird\" just means we take it all a little less seriously. \n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. It's like a kaleidoscope of color. Houses painted in every shade imaginable, gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the sidewalks. And in the summertime, there's this magical thing called \"free boxes.\" They're filled with treasures,  clothes, books, you name it!  You never know what you'll find, but it's always a surprise.\n\nThat's the magic of walking through a neighborhood in Southeast Portland. It's about the unexpected, the embracing of the unusual. That's what Portland is all about to me, anyway.  But hey, I'm just one weird person among thousands. Some folks I know wouldn't dream of digging through a box on the sidewalk. They're off doing goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats!) or cheering on the Timbers (the city's soccer team). Portland is a melting pot of passions, dreams, and well, maybe a few too many beers at the bar.\n\nOf course, we're not perfect. Like anywhere else, we have our problems. Drugs are a struggle, often rooted in deeper mental health issues. The constant rain and gray skies might not help matters. And then there's homelessness, a problem that seems to have no easy solutions. We have good social services, which attract people in need, but they're not enough.\n\nThe non-homeless folks, they wrestle with feelings of compassion and frustration. We're not so weird after all, in that way.",
            "The mountains, they're always there. Up north, watching the sun rise and set every day.  Even when I'm caught up in work and life, forgetting about them, they're still there. Strong, steady, unbothered by all the craziness.  But on the days when I'm totally stressed out, when my heart is racing, those mountains call to me.  When I turn to them, they give me a sense of peace, a little strength to keep going.\n\nI first fell for them when I moved here for undergrad.  The mountains north of campus were the first thing that stole my breath away. Sure, the university has its own beauty with its buildings, ponds, and trees – they hold a special place in my heart too. But those mountains, they rule it all.\n\nThe town itself is pretty amazing. There are so many cute cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and studying. Just a short walk or bus ride away, you're in the downtown area, surrounded by old buildings with faded bricks, giving it this old-world charm. It's like a mini-city with its own hustle and bustle. But step past the library, and you're back in that peaceful small-town vibe. This mix of atmospheres, right next to each other, makes this place so special. It's like it's begging you to explore it.\n\nIt's easy to make lasting memories here.  Maybe it's walking past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or racing through downtown to catch a movie at that fancy theater the university gave us tickets to. But, like all places, there are tough memories too. The ponds, especially, are a good spot for both reflection and crying sessions at 2 am when you're having an existential crisis, which, let's be honest, I've done more than a few times.  \n\nWatching the turtles, ducks, and bugs just living their lives, each with their own purpose, makes me wonder about my own place in the world. Sometimes, I walk past the pond, past the park, past those little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I reach a main street.  Then, the sun shines its golden rays on the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I look up at the sunrise, I realize I'm walking north. And there they are, just like they always are. Those strong mountains, towering over everything else, touching the hazy blue and yellow sky. They don't say a word, but they remind me to keep going.",
            "Okay, so you're thinking of checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Finding it is a piece of cake! The subway is super easy to use here, and it's how most New Yorkers get around. Bensonhurst is definitely a city neighborhood, so you'll still be right in the heart of it all. \n\nOne thing that really stands out in Bensonhurst is all the Asian stores.  Over the past twenty years, a ton of Asian folks have moved here, so you'll practically see an Asian-owned shop on every block. Supermarkets and laundromats seem to be the most popular, and guess what? They're super loved by the locals! The food in the supermarkets is amazing, the prices are way better than other places, and it's just so convenient to have them right around the corner. I'm serious, there are like four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from where I live! Talk about convenient grocery shopping!\n\nNow, don't think Bensonhurst is only for Asians though. It's actually a really mixed bag of people, with immigrants, first-generation Americans, and second-generation Americans all living here. But, most of the bigger stores and businesses around are owned by Asians.\n\nOh, and there's this awesome park nearby that's been recently redone. It's got ten basketball courts, a huge field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for them to cool off in the summer. It's a real melting pot of people there, all playing and getting along great.\n\nYou won't find any giant corporate buildings in Bensonhurst. Mostly, it's co-op buildings or condos.  A lot of people live in two-family houses, too. The people here are generally pretty cool, but they can be loud! You'll hear cars blasting music all day long, and sometimes they even rev their engines so loud that it wakes you up in the morning.\n\nIf you're visiting at night, just be a little careful. Bensonhurst is safe for the most part, but you never know. There are some folks who like to cause trouble for no reason, and you might run into some bullies or even thieves. I've had a couple of run-ins with bullies in the past, but that was years ago.  Just recently, I heard about someone who had their package stolen, so be aware of that too.\n\nOne last thing - don't expect people to clean up after their dogs here. Even though there are fines for not doing so, nobody really seems to care.  Every day, you'll probably see dog poop on your way to the train station or the supermarket. It's my biggest pet peeve! Just be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "My neighborhood is kinda unique, ya know?  It's like everything slopes downward, and my house sits right at the top of the biggest hill around.  People call it the \"workout hill\" 'cause all the joggers love to run up it.  The thing is, there aren't any sidewalks, so everyone just walks on the road.  It's a bit bumpy in places, and honestly, kinda scary to drive on sometimes.  Plus, the power lines and phone lines are all tangled up and look kinda ancient.  We get a lot of rain and storms here, so branches and stuff always knock down the power lines.  They're always patching them up, which makes them look all patchworky. \n\nEverywhere you look, there are these giant evergreen trees.  But, here's the kicker, everyone hates them!  They try to chop them down as much as possible because they block the view of the ocean.  That's why so many houses are built way up on the hill, with these huge windows on the second floor just to catch a glimpse of the bay.\n\nSunsets are pretty amazing though. The water lights up from below, and the sky turns this fiery orange.  But, it's usually cloudy, so you mostly see the sun through this hazy veil.  It's pretty much overcast and damp most of the time.  Moss grows on everything – roofs, cars, even railings!  Once, I left my car in the driveway for a month, and it was practically covered in green, furry moss. Took me forever to scrape it all off.\n\nThere aren't many kids around here. There's a school just a few blocks away, but most of the people are older folks, mostly retired.  Instead of kids, they have dogs. You see them everywhere - hanging out in lawns or chasing each other down the street.  Be careful if you leave a door or window open, 'cause they'll sneak right in! I found one once in my living room and had to shoo him out. \n\nRabbits are a bit of a nuisance too. They're pretty big and gardeners hate them because they dig up plants and burrow in lawns.  My cats, though, they love a good rabbit hunt and have practically cleared them out of the neighborhood.  We also have the usual birds – sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off.\n\nThere aren't any stores around here, but if you hike down to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving up fresh seafood. The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks along the shore are fun to chuck into the water. The bay isn't very wide – you can see the other side even through the mist most days.",
            "Y'all, let me tell you about my little corner of the world, right here in a quiet little town in Tennessee.  We're talkin' a real sleepy suburb, nestled between two big ol' highways. That means we get a bit more traffic than a fella might like, but other than that, it's peaceful as can be. Folks around here mostly keep to themselves, tending to their yards and such.  Wintertime, though, that's when the fun begins! We got a little hill right off our street, perfect for sledding. We live smack dab on the corner, so we see everybody comin' and goin'.  We know all the folks around here, their cars, their dogs, the whole shebang.  Whenever we see somethin' new rollin' through, well, we take notice.  Some folks like to take walks, stretch their legs, or just let their dogs sniff around. Kids on bikes, the usual kid stuff, you know?  We're homebodies at heart, workin' from home ourselves. It's just me, my wife, and our two little girls, eleven and fourteen.  So, folks are used to seein' us pop in and out, just livin' our lives.\n\nWe love to get outside, rain or shine!  Sometimes we fire up the grill on our back deck, and the smell of barbecue just fills the air.  You can't help but smile when that happens. Seems like there's always somebody mowin' their lawn around here, 'specially between March and October when that grass grows like crazy. We got a whole lotta trees around, 'cause this place used to be woods.  It's pretty shady, but come Fall, we're knee-deep in leaves. That means rakin' and burnin' 'em up, which I gotta say, smells mighty good. It's like Fall's official scent!\n\nLately, we ain't had much of a winter, so it feels like Fall's just hangin' around for dear life. Our garage is in the back, so we mostly use the front door when someone comes knockin', which ain't very often. I like to tinker in the garage on my truck or other projects.  When those garage doors are up, I feel like I'm right in the middle of it all.  Holidays are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving brings some family from out of town and cars are parked everywhere. Same goes for Mother's Day and Christmas.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't trade this place for the world. If it weren't for those pesky highways, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood, it's right smack dab in the middle of the high desert, ya know?  Dirt, dirt, and more dirt.  Unless you've lived here, it's hard to understand that feeling, always seeing brown.  And when you do see a green lawn, you just know that person is spending a fortune on keeping it that way.  Back when I first moved here in the 90s, the houses were spread out, wide open spaces. Now, it's getting a bit more crowded, lots of new houses popping up.  Honestly, it feels more like a city every day, but I guess that's how things go everywhere these days.  \n\nThe people here are mostly friendly, though, like anywhere, you've got your good and your bad.  I'm surrounded by really nice old folks, so I guess you could say it's a pretty decent neighborhood.  \n\nAs for stores, it's mostly the big chain stores you see everywhere: Food 4 Less, Smart & Final, that kind of thing.  If you want something more upscale, you gotta drive a bit.  Never see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here.  \n\nLooking around, most jobs seem to be in construction.  I figure that's because the city's still growing, lots of open land to build on.  It kind of scares me, though.  I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not looking to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living, actually.  Drywall and T-bar installation.   \n\nWhat I love about this place is all the critters.  People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert itself is a big draw.  It's a tough environment, but it has its own unique charm and it's home to all kinds of amazing wildlife.  We humans gotta learn to share this space with them and live together peacefully.\n\nMy family and I have gotten used to sharing our home with the wildlife. I got three kids, and they're totally obsessed with lizards and desert bugs! Right now, as I'm typing this, they're outside trying to catch some. \n\nThere are a few things to do around here, too.  Victorville is a good place for families, especially if you want a different kind of experience.  If you're visiting, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair - it's a blast!  And if you head up to Wrightwood nearby, you can see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons.\n\nWant to learn more about the desert's history and nature? The Victor Valley Museum has some great stuff - rocks, fossils, Native American artifacts, and old stuff from Victorville's past.",
            "Hmm, describing my neighborhood is kinda different from what everyone else might say.  While they probably talk about houses and backyards, my neighborhood is the college campus I call home. My dorm mates are my community, and the whole campus is my stomping ground.  It's a bit unique, I know, but it still has those neighborhood vibes. You've got your \"houses,\" your people, your shops, and even a park. Let me break it down for you.\n\nFirst, the \"houses\" - we've got apartments, actual houses for rent, and those classic dorm rooms.  Apartments have a few people per room, maybe 4 or 6 rooms per floor, with a couple of floors in a building. That's like 20 people in each building, give or take. Then there are the houses, more like family homes, mostly for alumni,  but not many of those around. And lastly, the dorm rooms, where most of us live – two people sharing, tons of students, the whole shebang.\n\nMy school is all about diversity, and that's what makes my neighborhood so interesting. You've got people from all walks of life, all ages. The staff usually live in those houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones grab the apartments. It's a melting pot, really.\n\nAnd let's not forget the shops and the park!  We've got all sorts of places to eat, campus-branded clothes and groceries - you name it, we've got it! And the park? It's our little oasis, lively and safe, thanks to everyone looking out for each other.\n\nSo yeah, my neighborhood might be a bit different, but it's got all the heart and soul of any good community.",
            "Hmm...my heart goes out to my old neighbourhood, Stockbridge. Ten years have flown by since we moved from Riverdale. I gotta admit, when we first arrived, it felt like a punch to the gut.  I missed my friends back in Riverdale, they were family to me. But my folks, bless their hearts, wanted the best for us. They thought Stockbridge would be a fresh start, a place where we could shine. A better school, a nicer house, you know, all that jazz.  \n\nIt took time, but I adjusted. Made some new friends, some who became super close, and some, well, let's just say they weren't so great.  Truth be told, I never really got to know most of the neighbours, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis for a bit, since they lived right next door. They're like family to me, so warm and welcoming. I'll never forget Mr. Glen's wedding (his second time down the aisle!). It was a blast, a real party. I even caught his wife's garter! Wish I'd snagged the bouquet too though. We danced the night away, and had a great time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her in ages, hope she's doing well.\n\nThis neighbourhood's a bit of a labyrinth, but I've got a GPS now, so I'm slowly exploring every nook and cranny.  Most of my adventures have been with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We were inseparable, spending hours glued to video games, just living life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd escape to the park, soak in the fresh air, let nature soothe my soul. It's my happy place. I even practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken (wooden sword) sometimes. The park also has a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't touched a racket or ball in ages. Still cool to have them there for when I feel like dusting off the old skills. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a blast, even though he pushed us hard! \n\nLooking back, I've made so many memories here, so many stories I could tell. But these are the ones that stick out: the warmth of Mr. Glen's family, the nights with Kason and Curtis, and the peace I find in the park. Stockbridge will always hold a special place in my heart. And you know what? I think the best is yet to come!",
            "Hmm...my current digs are pretty close to my school, which is a major plus. Mostly, it's all apartments around here, but there are a few little eateries and watering holes that are fun to hang out at, and they won't break the bank either. One of those bars just got a new name, and now it's a bit pricier, but the drinks and service are still decent. Most folks are alright, either students or folks who are on a tighter budget, since the apartments aren't too fancy.  There are quite a few kiddos around, thanks to the elementary school just a hop, skip, and a jump away. I don't really know my neighbors, and to be honest, I'm not too keen on getting to know them either. They seem to be bigtime weed enthusiasts, so the building management put an air freshener right by their door. My boyfriend and I found it hilarious, almost like a slap in the face, you know?  The buildings around here are kinda old-fashioned, but some of them have probably been spruced up inside.  \n\nDown the street, there are these brand-spanking-new apartments, but I'm not a fan. They look cheap, even if the rent is sky-high. It's a total rip-off, but because they're near campus, the management can get away with it. Speaking of places to eat, there's this super cheap joint about five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates, and most of it is microwaved. Across the street from there is a gas station, and I heard working there is a nightmare. However, thanks to some city dough, they redid the road last summer. Now, there's a wide sidewalk, lots of grass on the sides, and the whole area looks a bit more polished. \n\nMy building is covered in trees, though they chopped down a few, leaving some stumps. There are way more trees where I live compared to down the road. Behind my complex is a row of trees, and then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd street, but behind me is 43rd, and that one isn't as charming. The sidewalks are practically falling apart, and the buildings look pretty shabby. There are a lot of trees there too, probably trying to hide the state of things. Most of the crime in the area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I guess you can't blame them entirely. There are some other apartments across from me that have their fair share of crime and a revolving door of residents. \n\nBut honestly, I kind of like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of things I need nearby. I especially love that the university is just a walk away, and there are two bus stops that make it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is like a little slice of heaven, hidden away on a cul-de-sac. Each house is a duplex, spaced out so they look like individual homes.  They all wear the same sunny yellow paint and white porches, topped with bright green metal roofs. Almost everyone here knows each other, like a big, friendly family. Sometimes, we gather at the end of the road - no one really decides to meet, it just happens - and chat while the little ones play. It's so peaceful here, a real escape from all the hustle and bustle of the modern world. Feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees, with a big blue sky above and fluffy white clouds drifting by.\n\nBut even in this idyllic place, things can change in a flash. We've had tornado warnings lately, and last night, the sirens actually went off!  We all scurried for shelter. I grabbed my baby dog, my purse, and a couple of pillows and headed for the bathtub, feeling a little silly but safe. My big dog, well, he wasn't so keen on the idea of a bathroom bunker and stayed in the living room, whining and barking. Outside, the storm raged, with giant hailstones pounding the ground. After it passed, the road was literally steaming!  The temperature dropped from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes, and the hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. \n\nAs the clouds parted, the sun came out and the sky burst into a double rainbow. I rushed inside for my camera, snapping pictures to share with my family and friends. Everyone was amazed, just like me. The neighborhood stayed quiet for a while, with everyone probably still in shock.  Then, things went back to normal – moms and kids back outside, dinner cooking, the friendly chatter resuming. My heart swells with gratitude for finding this wonderful community.  \n\nIt’s such a joy living here,  especially after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina.  Though everyone has the same two-bed, two-bath apartments, each home is unique inside. Some are tiny, which seems odd. But hey, that's part of the charm!\n\nI love to walk through the big field behind my place down to the pond (no swimming allowed, though!). I’ve seen deer there and in the mornings, a giant bullfrog serenades me with his song. It's a beautiful place to live, just a hop, skip, and a jump from Charlotte. Every morning starts with the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like a little village, with a donkey at a nearby farm braying in the evenings.\n\nI'm so lucky to have found this little piece of paradise.",
            "Hmm...my heart n soui went to this neighborhood right as I was starting eighth grade. It was kinda hard to make friends at first, but then I met this awesome guy who lives two houses down and another one down the street. Neither of them live there now, but I still think about them. Most of the people who were here when I first moved in are still around. My neighborhood is pretty much like any other American suburb, you know? Lots of two-story houses, and every time the weather's nice, you hear kids playing outside. It's pretty quiet most days. I've never had any problems with anyone around here. You can be pretty much left alone unless you need something, which is nice. I've ordered tons of stuff online, and my packages have always been safe. I trust my neighbors. There's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my house. I've got tons of memories there. Me and the guys used to play basketball, football, and baseball there all the time.  I even got a pretty nasty elbow to the nose playing football, but those good times definitely outweigh the bad ones. Now, when I go there, it's mostly to hang out with my cousin's kids. They're way younger than me, and they still love going on swings and down slides. Just thinking about going there makes them so excited. The park makes me feel all nostalgic, you know?  My neighborhood is pretty diverse. There's all kinds of food around here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - you name it! But nowadays, most people just get their food delivered with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The most popular places are the fast food joints, which you can find pretty much anywhere. There are tons of pizza places, too. The stores around here have everything you could ever need. There are a bunch of dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is pretty popular around here. And some of them are even unique, like this Indian-owned store where you can get all the ingredients you need to make some awesome home-cooked Indian food, or even grab some ready-made meals. Overall, I love living here. Seeing all the crazy stories about neighbors on the news and social media makes me so thankful for the people around me.",
            "My little town, Johnston, is like a sweet little peach nestled in South Carolina. It ain't no fancy place, just a regular ol' town, but it's got a heart of gold, especially when it comes to peaches. They call it the Peach Capital of the World, and you know they take that seriously!  \n\nEverywhere you look, it's either peach trees as far as the eye can see or fields full of cows. The houses spread out like stars in the night sky, mostly two-story beauties with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or those classic gray shingles. Most of them ain't right on the road, they're tucked back in their own little world with fields out front for the animals or crops. \n\nThe whole town kinda revolves around this one stoplight, the heart of it all, where you'll find the only stores in town. Got your fast food fix at Hong Kong, the Chinese joint run by a family, Fiesta for some Mexican spice, or Gary's for a good ol' burger. Used to have a pizza place, but it closed down a while back, which is a real bummer.  There's Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny pharmacy known for their legendary Cherry Coca-Cola. And then there's IGA, the grocery store, kinda pricey but the only one around. Most folks go to Batesburg-Leesville for their big grocery hauls, though. \n\nBut the real star of the show is Dollar General! It's packed from morning till night with folks grabbing everyday essentials.  \n\nThen there's Possibilities Furniture & More, run by this sweet lady who's a fixture in town. She's been there forever and even has movers to deliver your purchases! Right next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where your furry friends can get pampered with baths, haircuts, and even daycare.\n\nThe doctor and vet are off the beaten path a little, but they're good folks, always there to help. And there's Johnston Elementary, where kids learn their ABCs until fifth grade. After that, they have to head to the next town for middle and high school. \n\nDon't expect any fancy parks or playgrounds here, but they're working on creating a little recreational area.  Truth be told, there ain't much to do in Johnston. No movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hang-out spots. But it's a good town, real friendly, and blink and you might just miss it!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was on a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit of a shocker, you know? I mean, every apartment in this area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I never heard a peep about anything like that, and neither did my friends. Maybe it's just life, I guess. I know a few friends who cry themselves to sleep at night, ya know? Things are tight, but we've learned to make do over the years. You start appreciating the dustiest of flea market toys, the worn-out clothes that smell like memories. You don't smell as much as an adult, I guess. Maybe you start smoking, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But the flea market always calls to you.  The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a piano, waiting to be played. It sinks into the leather, stays with you even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. You can start on one end and hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a madhouse, cars and people everywhere in the morning, but you wouldn't hear a thing in those thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, it's always quiet. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more of those. Cars and people, they just keep pouring in. It's a growing city, they say. Headquartered for one of the biggest online empires, you can see the pains of growing up.  Reminds me of New York, actually. Everyone's focused on their own thing, no one really expects much from you. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and folks will leave you be.  Not like back home, in the South, where a little concern means you care. People don't pry into your life here, not really. You can keep your walls up as long as you want, and the city just rolls on, like waves crashing on the beach. It's a lively place to be, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we're less like apartments of strangers and more like a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, help each other out when we can. I'm lucky to be here, I guess. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty good. I try to keep things clean, leave them food, and they do the same. We bring each other mail, stuff like that. It's nice to see them, and I think they like me being around, too. I live in this massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely screw up my life.",
            "My neighbourhood, well, it's like stepping into a picture postcard of suburbia, you know? Every nook and cranny screams \"cookie cutter\" and the homeowner's association is like the captain of this perfectly manicured ship.  \n\nJust picture this: neat, tidy single-family homes lining the streets, all looking like twins.  The front yards are basically carbon copies of each other - a patch of green grass, some decorative pebbles, and driveways that seem too short for two cars. You'll spot a few trees here and there, but not many.  It's all very... predictable. \n\nAnd speaking of predictability, the roads are always spotless! No potholes or cracks mar the freshly paved concrete.  Most houses are single-story, but occasionally you'll stumble upon a two-story beauty. \n\nBut forget those traditional mailboxes you see on TV, we do things differently here.  No individual boxes in front of each house, no sir! It's more like an apartment complex with a giant bank of mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a special key to open yours, and there are even bigger lockers for packages.  The HOA really loves their uniformity, you see.\n\nMy house sits on the edge of the city, so it's a bit of a hybrid - part suburbia, part country.  We have a lot of space, which means there are multiple community pools (they're gated and sparkling clean!) and walking trails perfect for a stroll with your dog or a peaceful evening walk.  You don't even need to go to a park to get your exercise in, just run around the neighborhood!\n\nMost of the people here are retired folks, which makes the area incredibly safe and friendly.  Everyone looks out for each other.   We also have a sprinkle of middle-aged and young professionals mixed in.\n\nThe city itself is surprisingly big, but it has that small-town charm.  We have all the necessary amenities, like a single mall (not huge, but it gets the job done!). It's a quick 15-minute drive to get to the bigger shopping centers, where you can find everything from fancy organic groceries to bargain stores with bare-bones staff and minimal selection.\n\nAll in all, my neighborhood is pretty typical, safe, well-maintained, and comfortable. We have pools, trails, and a sense of community. It's not right next to a bustling city center, but a short drive gets you there.",
            "My life here in this small town, tucked away just outside a big city, is kinda like a mixed bag, you know? Where we live, on the east side, it's not the fanciest place. Houses are older, mostly rented out, and things can get a bit rough around the edges. But honestly, it's not bad. People are friendly, always waving and saying hello. Sure, there's been some trouble, like a few shootings and even a murder, but it's not like it's constant. It's heartbreaking when something like that happens, like when our neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting.  For us, it's been mostly just the occasional thing going missing from our porch if we forget to bring it in.  \n\nBut the whole opioid thing, that's been tough on our town, like everywhere else, I guess. It's taken some good people from us. But thankfully, there's a lot of support here, with places to get help and programs for families dealing with this stuff.\n\nHonestly, there's a lot to love about this town too. My son goes to a fantastic elementary school. The teachers and the principal, they're all amazing. He's got some special needs, but he's never been bullied there, everyone is so accepting. They even have a great PTO that does all sorts of things to keep families involved.  Because a lot of folks here struggle financially, the school makes sure every kid gets breakfast and lunch, no questions asked. It's a real community effort, you know?\n\nThe town itself has been working hard to improve things, fixing up roads, parks, and making it look nicer. But it seems like most of the attention is focused on the west side, where the shopping is and everything. Our side, the east side, we're left behind a little bit.  \n\nOverall, I'm happy here. It's home. People are good, the schools are great, there's enough to do, and our house, well, it might not be worth much, but it's ours. We've been here for over 16 years, and I can't imagine leaving.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a real melting pot, you know?  It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings that have stories to tell. My apartment building is seven stories high, right across from this old theater that's seen its share of history.  Down the hill, just a block away, is this cool little bar that attracts all sorts of folks, especially on warm summer nights. You'll often see a line of people stretching down the block, especially on weeknights in June and July. A few blocks up is a park, a pretty decent-sized one for this part of town. It's fenced off with concrete, and there are these tall stairs built right into the wall. Come winter, when it gets really cold, you'll see homeless folks setting up their tents in neat little rows along the sidewalk and on those wide steps. It doesn't snow much here, but the rain in the middle of winter can be brutal.  They stay close together, right in the heart of the city, for warmth. Plus, it's not far to walk or take the bus to the nearest family center, where they can get a hot shower and a bit of a break.\n\nBut honestly, what I love most about this city isn't the old buildings or the history—though there's plenty of that. It's the people. You see, Hilltop used to be known as the most dangerous place on the West Coast, back in the day. Even now, thirty years later, you hear stories about the government agents and the DEA trying to clean up the streets. It's something that's woven into the fabric of this place, passed down from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me.  Even though people still say it's one of the rougher neighborhoods in the city, they work hard to keep it clean and safe. They care about what happens on their block, in their city.\n\nThey'll tell you not to walk around Hilltop after dark if you're white. I think that's just a remnant of the old days, a bit of outdated thinking. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who gets it. Someone who knows about the whispers of racism and prejudice that still linger, even in a place that's supposed to be a melting pot. \n\nOne thing's for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. There's a vibrancy here, a sense of community that I feel in my bones. I feel safe walking these streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where the laundromat owner will stay open late so I can charge my phone when I'm caught in a downpour. It's a place where I can sit huddled on a cold night, feeling invisible, only to have someone look me in the eye, hand me a five-dollar bill, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "My life unfolds in the heart of Rural America, in a quaint little town nestled in Michigan. It's a world where rolling farmlands gently transition into charming tourist spots. Forget about towering city malls, bustling Wal-marts, or even the familiar red brick facade of an Applebee's. Here, every adventure, every errand, requires a journey behind the wheel. But despite this quiet simplicity, I reside in a place of breathtaking beauty, embraced by the shimmering waters of two magnificent lakes: the vast expanse of Lake Michigan and the picturesque Lake Charlevoix. Every turn reveals a new beach, beckoning you to dip your toes into the cool embrace of the water.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the true essence of small-town charm. Houses aren't crammed together like sardines in a can; they stand proudly, each with its own unique story to tell. Some have been lovingly restored, their vintage charm enhanced with modern touches, while others retain their original character, whispering tales of bygone eras. Most have full basements, their presence evident from the street, and the siding often sports a classic aluminum sheen. \n\nMy block is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Gardens bursting with life, vibrant fences enclosing playful pets, and gleaming trampolines and swings in backyards – these are the hallmarks of our community. It's a tapestry woven with the threads of hard-working families, raising children who fill the streets with their laughter.\n\nThe pace of life here is gentle, a soothing melody of familiar sights and sounds. Children's laughter echoes through the streets, accompanied by the pitter-patter of dog paws and the gentle whir of bicycle wheels. Neighbors greet each other with friendly waves and smiles, a sense of belonging woven into the very fabric of our community. Well-manicured lawns, free from fallen leaves and overgrown weeds, reflect a pride in our homes and our shared space.\n\nThis isn't a neighborhood that boasts extravagant mansions or dazzling facades. Its beauty lies in its simplicity, its quiet strength, and the undeniable sense of safety and comfort it offers. It's a place where families flourish, where children are free to play, and where the worries of the world melt away.\n\nJust a stone's throw away, the county sheriff's department stands as a reassuring presence, a symbol of security. The health department and recycling center are close at hand, serving the needs of our community. The nearby baseball and softball fields buzz with the excitement of local games, while the small airport adds a touch of adventure to our daily lives, with the rumble of planes taking off and landing a constant reminder of the world beyond our borders. \n\nLife here is sweet, a symphony of everyday pleasures. A walk to the local ice cream parlor, a bike ride to the park – these are the simple joys that make our community special. It's a place where life unfolds at a slower pace, where neighbors become friends, and where the heart finds solace in the warmth of belonging."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood in this big city is a real mix of everything! Houses and stores are scattered around, like someone just threw them down randomly. You've got your usual shops and restaurants, but there are always new places popping up. Some are big chains, but I see more and more little, independent stores opening up too. They're everywhere, even on quiet streets, which makes it fun to explore. There are a couple of parks nearby, and it's adorable to see families with little kids playing there.\n\nNow, the people here are just as diverse as the places. There's a whole LGBTQ+ community, a group of Orthodox Jews, and even a bunch of people who came here from the former Soviet Union, all in one little area. \n\nIf you go a bit further out, you'll find even more different cultures. There's Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and tons more, all within a short drive...though,  \"short\" can be a bit relative in this city! Traffic can be brutal, especially during rush hour, so a 10-mile drive can take forever. \n\nIt's funny, because everyone drives everywhere, but nobody walks. There are things to see and do nearby, but this city is huge! People just don't want to walk that far.  So, we've got some of the worst traffic in the world and parking is a nightmare.  \n\nAnd get this: even with all the traffic and parking problems, they keep building more apartments! It seems like everyone wants to live here, but some people are worried about even more people and cars crowding the streets.\n\nBut hey, not everyone wants to live in a giant apartment building.  There are tons of houses of all sizes,  duplexes, and smaller apartment complexes.  It's a mix of everything, just like the people!\n\nThere are all ages here too, and to be honest, I don't really know most of my neighbors. It's not like the tight-knit neighborhood I grew up in, where I spent all my time playing outside with my friends. Back then, we were practically inseparable.",
            "My neighbourhood, its a real character, ya know? Most of the houses are those big ol' single family ones, but some folks have split theirs up, like joining two houses together, but still keeping them separate. My place has a little patch of grass out front and a tiny driveway to the side. It's like a snapshot from a time when living in the suburbs was the big dream, the American dream, you understand? It felt like everyone was chasing it back then, but now, it's like the dream's kinda slipping away. \n\nBut my neighbourhood, and a whole bunch of others like it, they're still holding on. They're shoutin' out, \"Hey, the dream's still alive!\" We're clingin' to it with all we got. Folks ain't as bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as they used to be, the lawns ain't quite as perfect, but there's still cars parkin' in every driveway, and kids playin' like the world's their own playground.  \n\nThat old school, been standin' for almost 90 years, it's still there, makin' dreams for the young'uns and bringin' back memories for the old-timers.  Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always buzzin'. Each house looks different, but they all kinda feel the same, like they got that same old soul.\n\nWe got this big supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by this big Yemeni family, they might be the only ones from around there in the whole neighbourhood. Mostly everyone else is African American. Streets are wide, kids playin' football like it's the only thing that matters, only stop when the cars come by. Most folks here have been here forever, got stories about the good ol' days when everyone knew everyone.\n\nUsed to be a karate school, but Hollywood stopped makin' those \"Karate Kid\" movies, so the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, guess drugs are the new craze. There's also this tiny movie theatre, shows old flicks for cheap. The young folks mock it, but the older folks love it, a night out without the kids, for a steal.\n\nWe got this one big highway runnin' through town, but the on-ramp and off-ramp are in the next town over. Back in the day, folks tried to get an exit here, but the young'uns wanted it, the old folks said it'd ruin the town, and well, they got their way. \n\nNow they're building a new high school, and we're tryin' to pick a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect fit for this place.",
            "Okay, so you might just breeze past this place, thinking it's nothin' special. It's tucked away behind some shops, not exactly the kind of spot you'd expect to find a whole community, ya know? But hang on, because if you sneak past the old, forgotten Whole Foods and wander behind those hotels that only get filled up once a year, maybe for family get-togethers, you'll stumble onto a whole world you never knew existed.  \n\nThere are these apartment buildings lined up like a bunch of Russian nesting dolls, all carefully taken apart and put back together in a row. Now, the first ones you see, they've been on the news for some shady stuff, so let's not dwell on those too much. But the ones next to them, and the ones after those, those are a whole different story. Almost nobody around here even knows they're there.  \n\nAcross from those apartments, you'll find a little community college branch - a quiet place with sleepy buildings, where students amble in with their coffee cups, yawning their way into the 7 AM morning. The iron gates creak open, letting them in one by one, while the commuters in their cars shake their fists and grumble about them holding up traffic on busy days. The road bumps into another residential street, with a park on one side and a place where people go to heal up after getting hurt. They call it a rehabilitation center, and it's got these cheerful porch chairs and a lazy ceiling fan that keeps the warm summer air moving. \n\nKids are running around in the park across the street, cartwheeling and spinning like crazy, while bees buzz around the flower patches by the road. Old folks walk their dogs, grumbling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls hanging out by the swings, chatting about boys and the latest TikTok trends.  There's a sushi place in a strip mall next to the park, with cheap eats but never too crowded. Right beside it is a swimming supply store, and stuck in between is a nail salon. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, and grab some hibachi chicken, all in one go – that's the beauty of a strip mall. There's even a frozen yogurt place there, the kind where you build your own sundae, and you see the teens from the park all the time, holding their cold, drippy cups of frozen yogurt while they try out tricks on their skateboards and puff away on their vapes, thinking they look super cool.  \n\nThis whole neighborhood, it's like a snapshot of America, a little piece of history in the sleepy south where things just stay the same, even time seems to slow down.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked, her voice tinged with wonder as we drove past endless rows of cornfields.  I knew she wouldn't understand this vast expanse. She came from a town where the grocery store was a stone's throw away, where life was a constant buzz of activity.  I smiled, taking her hand. \"This is it,\" I said, letting her feel the quiet hum of the countryside.\n\nShe gaped at the horizon, her eyes wide with a mixture of awe and disbelief. It was in these stretches of quiet, under the watchful gaze of the cornfields, that I truly felt at home. I told her stories of my childhood here in Ohio, of the summers filled with fireflies and the winters blanketed in snow. I painted pictures with my words, sharing the rhythm of life in a place where time seemed to move a little slower.\n\nWe passed a quarry, its water shimmering like a jewel in the sun. Just beyond it, nestled amongst the rolling hills, was my neighborhood. Brick and stucco homes, each with a sprawling yard, lined the roads.  People took pride in their gardens, bursting with color in the spring and autumn. Shiny Mercedes Benzes, gleaming after a good wash, lined the driveways, a testament to the success of those who called this place home.\n\nA friendly face greeted us as we neared my house. My Korean neighbor, a retired doctor, was always out tending his lawn, humming a tune as his mower hummed. We all loved his quirky ways, his sunny disposition never faltering, even as time etched lines on his face.  He was a reminder that life, despite its challenges, could still be filled with simple joys.\n\nMy house stood at the end of a quiet lane, its grey stucco walls blending with the surrounding landscape. Geese honked in the side yard, chased playfully by our energetic terrier.  In the backyard, a small stream gurgled, its melody punctuated by the croaking of bullfrogs and the distant moo of cows.\n\nA hand-built wooden bridge crossed the stream, leading to a secret oasis. A haven of trees, herbs, and wildflowers, it was here that I spent countless hours as a child. Building forts, chasing squirrels, exploring the woods - it was a world of endless possibilities.\n\nWinter transformed the landscape into a stark, beautiful canvas. The vibrant greens faded, replaced by a tapestry of browns and grays. Snow blanketed the world, transforming the ordinary into something magical. My sister and I would build snow forts, armed with snowballs and laughter. We'd carve out igloos, our makeshift arsenals filled with branches, our imaginations running wild.\n\nThose winters were tough, but they were also filled with a special kind of magic.  The snow brought a sense of wonder, a reminder that even in the coldest of times, there was beauty to be found.\n\nWe were just kids then, lost in our own little world. We didn't know anything about the world beyond the snow-covered fields and our backyard haven. We just knew that we had each other, and that was all that mattered.",
            "Ah, Portland, Oregon... You gotta understand what \"weird\" truly means here. It's not just a quirky badge, it's woven into the very fabric of the city. This idea, you see, is immortalized on a building that somehow manages to be a pizza place, a bar, a music venue, a strip club, and probably a few other things that could land its owner in hot water.  It says, \"Keep Portland Weird.\"  Some folks, they see it as a nostalgic shout-out to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time before it became a hot spot for Californians with deep pockets and a fondness for high-rise condos. They remember a Portland that was more hidden, more affordable, a breeding ground for unique and amazing subcultures. Others, well, they hear it as a siren song, a beckoning to a place where weird isn't just tolerated, it's celebrated.  \n\nBut let me tell you, even with all those fancy new condos popping up and the influx of folks from across the bridge, Portland still holds onto its weird.  \n\nNow, weird doesn't mean everyone's always cool with everything. It doesn't mean we don't have our share of modern problems and modern conveniences, like everyone else. We buy our stuff from China, just like the rest of the country. There are a million ways to be weird, to be outside the norm, but Portland has plenty of \"normal\" too. We've got our yoga enthusiasts, our hipsters, our business folks, the whole shebang.  Maybe \"weird\" just means we take it all a little less seriously. \n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. It's like a kaleidoscope of color. Houses painted in every shade imaginable, gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the sidewalks. And in the summertime, there's this magical thing called \"free boxes.\" They're filled with treasures,  clothes, books, you name it!  You never know what you'll find, but it's always a surprise.\n\nThat's the magic of walking through a neighborhood in Southeast Portland. It's about the unexpected, the embracing of the unusual. That's what Portland is all about to me, anyway.  But hey, I'm just one weird person among thousands. Some folks I know wouldn't dream of digging through a box on the sidewalk. They're off doing goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats!) or cheering on the Timbers (the city's soccer team). Portland is a melting pot of passions, dreams, and well, maybe a few too many beers at the bar.\n\nOf course, we're not perfect. Like anywhere else, we have our problems. Drugs are a struggle, often rooted in deeper mental health issues. The constant rain and gray skies might not help matters. And then there's homelessness, a problem that seems to have no easy solutions. We have good social services, which attract people in need, but they're not enough.\n\nThe non-homeless folks, they wrestle with feelings of compassion and frustration. We're not so weird after all, in that way.",
            "The mountains, they're always there. Up north, watching the sun rise and set every day.  Even when I'm caught up in work and life, forgetting about them, they're still there. Strong, steady, unbothered by all the craziness.  But on the days when I'm totally stressed out, when my heart is racing, those mountains call to me.  When I turn to them, they give me a sense of peace, a little strength to keep going.\n\nI first fell for them when I moved here for undergrad.  The mountains north of campus were the first thing that stole my breath away. Sure, the university has its own beauty with its buildings, ponds, and trees – they hold a special place in my heart too. But those mountains, they rule it all.\n\nThe town itself is pretty amazing. There are so many cute cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and studying. Just a short walk or bus ride away, you're in the downtown area, surrounded by old buildings with faded bricks, giving it this old-world charm. It's like a mini-city with its own hustle and bustle. But step past the library, and you're back in that peaceful small-town vibe. This mix of atmospheres, right next to each other, makes this place so special. It's like it's begging you to explore it.\n\nIt's easy to make lasting memories here.  Maybe it's walking past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or racing through downtown to catch a movie at that fancy theater the university gave us tickets to. But, like all places, there are tough memories too. The ponds, especially, are a good spot for both reflection and crying sessions at 2 am when you're having an existential crisis, which, let's be honest, I've done more than a few times.  \n\nWatching the turtles, ducks, and bugs just living their lives, each with their own purpose, makes me wonder about my own place in the world. Sometimes, I walk past the pond, past the park, past those little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I reach a main street.  Then, the sun shines its golden rays on the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I look up at the sunrise, I realize I'm walking north. And there they are, just like they always are. Those strong mountains, towering over everything else, touching the hazy blue and yellow sky. They don't say a word, but they remind me to keep going.",
            "Okay, so you're thinking of checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Finding it is a piece of cake! The subway is super easy to use here, and it's how most New Yorkers get around. Bensonhurst is definitely a city neighborhood, so you'll still be right in the heart of it all. \n\nOne thing that really stands out in Bensonhurst is all the Asian stores.  Over the past twenty years, a ton of Asian folks have moved here, so you'll practically see an Asian-owned shop on every block. Supermarkets and laundromats seem to be the most popular, and guess what? They're super loved by the locals! The food in the supermarkets is amazing, the prices are way better than other places, and it's just so convenient to have them right around the corner. I'm serious, there are like four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from where I live! Talk about convenient grocery shopping!\n\nNow, don't think Bensonhurst is only for Asians though. It's actually a really mixed bag of people, with immigrants, first-generation Americans, and second-generation Americans all living here. But, most of the bigger stores and businesses around are owned by Asians.\n\nOh, and there's this awesome park nearby that's been recently redone. It's got ten basketball courts, a huge field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for them to cool off in the summer. It's a real melting pot of people there, all playing and getting along great.\n\nYou won't find any giant corporate buildings in Bensonhurst. Mostly, it's co-op buildings or condos.  A lot of people live in two-family houses, too. The people here are generally pretty cool, but they can be loud! You'll hear cars blasting music all day long, and sometimes they even rev their engines so loud that it wakes you up in the morning.\n\nIf you're visiting at night, just be a little careful. Bensonhurst is safe for the most part, but you never know. There are some folks who like to cause trouble for no reason, and you might run into some bullies or even thieves. I've had a couple of run-ins with bullies in the past, but that was years ago.  Just recently, I heard about someone who had their package stolen, so be aware of that too.\n\nOne last thing - don't expect people to clean up after their dogs here. Even though there are fines for not doing so, nobody really seems to care.  Every day, you'll probably see dog poop on your way to the train station or the supermarket. It's my biggest pet peeve! Just be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "My neighborhood is kinda unique, ya know?  It's like everything slopes downward, and my house sits right at the top of the biggest hill around.  People call it the \"workout hill\" 'cause all the joggers love to run up it.  The thing is, there aren't any sidewalks, so everyone just walks on the road.  It's a bit bumpy in places, and honestly, kinda scary to drive on sometimes.  Plus, the power lines and phone lines are all tangled up and look kinda ancient.  We get a lot of rain and storms here, so branches and stuff always knock down the power lines.  They're always patching them up, which makes them look all patchworky. \n\nEverywhere you look, there are these giant evergreen trees.  But, here's the kicker, everyone hates them!  They try to chop them down as much as possible because they block the view of the ocean.  That's why so many houses are built way up on the hill, with these huge windows on the second floor just to catch a glimpse of the bay.\n\nSunsets are pretty amazing though. The water lights up from below, and the sky turns this fiery orange.  But, it's usually cloudy, so you mostly see the sun through this hazy veil.  It's pretty much overcast and damp most of the time.  Moss grows on everything – roofs, cars, even railings!  Once, I left my car in the driveway for a month, and it was practically covered in green, furry moss. Took me forever to scrape it all off.\n\nThere aren't many kids around here. There's a school just a few blocks away, but most of the people are older folks, mostly retired.  Instead of kids, they have dogs. You see them everywhere - hanging out in lawns or chasing each other down the street.  Be careful if you leave a door or window open, 'cause they'll sneak right in! I found one once in my living room and had to shoo him out. \n\nRabbits are a bit of a nuisance too. They're pretty big and gardeners hate them because they dig up plants and burrow in lawns.  My cats, though, they love a good rabbit hunt and have practically cleared them out of the neighborhood.  We also have the usual birds – sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off.\n\nThere aren't any stores around here, but if you hike down to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving up fresh seafood. The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks along the shore are fun to chuck into the water. The bay isn't very wide – you can see the other side even through the mist most days.",
            "Y'all, let me tell you about my little corner of the world, right here in a quiet little town in Tennessee.  We're talkin' a real sleepy suburb, nestled between two big ol' highways. That means we get a bit more traffic than a fella might like, but other than that, it's peaceful as can be. Folks around here mostly keep to themselves, tending to their yards and such.  Wintertime, though, that's when the fun begins! We got a little hill right off our street, perfect for sledding. We live smack dab on the corner, so we see everybody comin' and goin'.  We know all the folks around here, their cars, their dogs, the whole shebang.  Whenever we see somethin' new rollin' through, well, we take notice.  Some folks like to take walks, stretch their legs, or just let their dogs sniff around. Kids on bikes, the usual kid stuff, you know?  We're homebodies at heart, workin' from home ourselves. It's just me, my wife, and our two little girls, eleven and fourteen.  So, folks are used to seein' us pop in and out, just livin' our lives.\n\nWe love to get outside, rain or shine!  Sometimes we fire up the grill on our back deck, and the smell of barbecue just fills the air.  You can't help but smile when that happens. Seems like there's always somebody mowin' their lawn around here, 'specially between March and October when that grass grows like crazy. We got a whole lotta trees around, 'cause this place used to be woods.  It's pretty shady, but come Fall, we're knee-deep in leaves. That means rakin' and burnin' 'em up, which I gotta say, smells mighty good. It's like Fall's official scent!\n\nLately, we ain't had much of a winter, so it feels like Fall's just hangin' around for dear life. Our garage is in the back, so we mostly use the front door when someone comes knockin', which ain't very often. I like to tinker in the garage on my truck or other projects.  When those garage doors are up, I feel like I'm right in the middle of it all.  Holidays are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving brings some family from out of town and cars are parked everywhere. Same goes for Mother's Day and Christmas.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't trade this place for the world. If it weren't for those pesky highways, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood, it's right smack dab in the middle of the high desert, ya know?  Dirt, dirt, and more dirt.  Unless you've lived here, it's hard to understand that feeling, always seeing brown.  And when you do see a green lawn, you just know that person is spending a fortune on keeping it that way.  Back when I first moved here in the 90s, the houses were spread out, wide open spaces. Now, it's getting a bit more crowded, lots of new houses popping up.  Honestly, it feels more like a city every day, but I guess that's how things go everywhere these days.  \n\nThe people here are mostly friendly, though, like anywhere, you've got your good and your bad.  I'm surrounded by really nice old folks, so I guess you could say it's a pretty decent neighborhood.  \n\nAs for stores, it's mostly the big chain stores you see everywhere: Food 4 Less, Smart & Final, that kind of thing.  If you want something more upscale, you gotta drive a bit.  Never see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here.  \n\nLooking around, most jobs seem to be in construction.  I figure that's because the city's still growing, lots of open land to build on.  It kind of scares me, though.  I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not looking to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living, actually.  Drywall and T-bar installation.   \n\nWhat I love about this place is all the critters.  People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert itself is a big draw.  It's a tough environment, but it has its own unique charm and it's home to all kinds of amazing wildlife.  We humans gotta learn to share this space with them and live together peacefully.\n\nMy family and I have gotten used to sharing our home with the wildlife. I got three kids, and they're totally obsessed with lizards and desert bugs! Right now, as I'm typing this, they're outside trying to catch some. \n\nThere are a few things to do around here, too.  Victorville is a good place for families, especially if you want a different kind of experience.  If you're visiting, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair - it's a blast!  And if you head up to Wrightwood nearby, you can see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons.\n\nWant to learn more about the desert's history and nature? The Victor Valley Museum has some great stuff - rocks, fossils, Native American artifacts, and old stuff from Victorville's past.",
            "Hmm, describing my neighborhood is kinda different from what everyone else might say.  While they probably talk about houses and backyards, my neighborhood is the college campus I call home. My dorm mates are my community, and the whole campus is my stomping ground.  It's a bit unique, I know, but it still has those neighborhood vibes. You've got your \"houses,\" your people, your shops, and even a park. Let me break it down for you.\n\nFirst, the \"houses\" - we've got apartments, actual houses for rent, and those classic dorm rooms.  Apartments have a few people per room, maybe 4 or 6 rooms per floor, with a couple of floors in a building. That's like 20 people in each building, give or take. Then there are the houses, more like family homes, mostly for alumni,  but not many of those around. And lastly, the dorm rooms, where most of us live – two people sharing, tons of students, the whole shebang.\n\nMy school is all about diversity, and that's what makes my neighborhood so interesting. You've got people from all walks of life, all ages. The staff usually live in those houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones grab the apartments. It's a melting pot, really.\n\nAnd let's not forget the shops and the park!  We've got all sorts of places to eat, campus-branded clothes and groceries - you name it, we've got it! And the park? It's our little oasis, lively and safe, thanks to everyone looking out for each other.\n\nSo yeah, my neighborhood might be a bit different, but it's got all the heart and soul of any good community.",
            "Hmm...my heart goes out to my old neighbourhood, Stockbridge. Ten years have flown by since we moved from Riverdale. I gotta admit, when we first arrived, it felt like a punch to the gut.  I missed my friends back in Riverdale, they were family to me. But my folks, bless their hearts, wanted the best for us. They thought Stockbridge would be a fresh start, a place where we could shine. A better school, a nicer house, you know, all that jazz.  \n\nIt took time, but I adjusted. Made some new friends, some who became super close, and some, well, let's just say they weren't so great.  Truth be told, I never really got to know most of the neighbours, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis for a bit, since they lived right next door. They're like family to me, so warm and welcoming. I'll never forget Mr. Glen's wedding (his second time down the aisle!). It was a blast, a real party. I even caught his wife's garter! Wish I'd snagged the bouquet too though. We danced the night away, and had a great time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her in ages, hope she's doing well.\n\nThis neighbourhood's a bit of a labyrinth, but I've got a GPS now, so I'm slowly exploring every nook and cranny.  Most of my adventures have been with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We were inseparable, spending hours glued to video games, just living life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd escape to the park, soak in the fresh air, let nature soothe my soul. It's my happy place. I even practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken (wooden sword) sometimes. The park also has a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't touched a racket or ball in ages. Still cool to have them there for when I feel like dusting off the old skills. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a blast, even though he pushed us hard! \n\nLooking back, I've made so many memories here, so many stories I could tell. But these are the ones that stick out: the warmth of Mr. Glen's family, the nights with Kason and Curtis, and the peace I find in the park. Stockbridge will always hold a special place in my heart. And you know what? I think the best is yet to come!",
            "Hmm...my current digs are pretty close to my school, which is a major plus. Mostly, it's all apartments around here, but there are a few little eateries and watering holes that are fun to hang out at, and they won't break the bank either. One of those bars just got a new name, and now it's a bit pricier, but the drinks and service are still decent. Most folks are alright, either students or folks who are on a tighter budget, since the apartments aren't too fancy.  There are quite a few kiddos around, thanks to the elementary school just a hop, skip, and a jump away. I don't really know my neighbors, and to be honest, I'm not too keen on getting to know them either. They seem to be bigtime weed enthusiasts, so the building management put an air freshener right by their door. My boyfriend and I found it hilarious, almost like a slap in the face, you know?  The buildings around here are kinda old-fashioned, but some of them have probably been spruced up inside.  \n\nDown the street, there are these brand-spanking-new apartments, but I'm not a fan. They look cheap, even if the rent is sky-high. It's a total rip-off, but because they're near campus, the management can get away with it. Speaking of places to eat, there's this super cheap joint about five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates, and most of it is microwaved. Across the street from there is a gas station, and I heard working there is a nightmare. However, thanks to some city dough, they redid the road last summer. Now, there's a wide sidewalk, lots of grass on the sides, and the whole area looks a bit more polished. \n\nMy building is covered in trees, though they chopped down a few, leaving some stumps. There are way more trees where I live compared to down the road. Behind my complex is a row of trees, and then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd street, but behind me is 43rd, and that one isn't as charming. The sidewalks are practically falling apart, and the buildings look pretty shabby. There are a lot of trees there too, probably trying to hide the state of things. Most of the crime in the area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I guess you can't blame them entirely. There are some other apartments across from me that have their fair share of crime and a revolving door of residents. \n\nBut honestly, I kind of like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of things I need nearby. I especially love that the university is just a walk away, and there are two bus stops that make it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is like a little slice of heaven, hidden away on a cul-de-sac. Each house is a duplex, spaced out so they look like individual homes.  They all wear the same sunny yellow paint and white porches, topped with bright green metal roofs. Almost everyone here knows each other, like a big, friendly family. Sometimes, we gather at the end of the road - no one really decides to meet, it just happens - and chat while the little ones play. It's so peaceful here, a real escape from all the hustle and bustle of the modern world. Feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees, with a big blue sky above and fluffy white clouds drifting by.\n\nBut even in this idyllic place, things can change in a flash. We've had tornado warnings lately, and last night, the sirens actually went off!  We all scurried for shelter. I grabbed my baby dog, my purse, and a couple of pillows and headed for the bathtub, feeling a little silly but safe. My big dog, well, he wasn't so keen on the idea of a bathroom bunker and stayed in the living room, whining and barking. Outside, the storm raged, with giant hailstones pounding the ground. After it passed, the road was literally steaming!  The temperature dropped from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes, and the hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. \n\nAs the clouds parted, the sun came out and the sky burst into a double rainbow. I rushed inside for my camera, snapping pictures to share with my family and friends. Everyone was amazed, just like me. The neighborhood stayed quiet for a while, with everyone probably still in shock.  Then, things went back to normal – moms and kids back outside, dinner cooking, the friendly chatter resuming. My heart swells with gratitude for finding this wonderful community.  \n\nIt’s such a joy living here,  especially after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina.  Though everyone has the same two-bed, two-bath apartments, each home is unique inside. Some are tiny, which seems odd. But hey, that's part of the charm!\n\nI love to walk through the big field behind my place down to the pond (no swimming allowed, though!). I’ve seen deer there and in the mornings, a giant bullfrog serenades me with his song. It's a beautiful place to live, just a hop, skip, and a jump from Charlotte. Every morning starts with the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like a little village, with a donkey at a nearby farm braying in the evenings.\n\nI'm so lucky to have found this little piece of paradise.",
            "Hmm...my heart n soui went to this neighborhood right as I was starting eighth grade. It was kinda hard to make friends at first, but then I met this awesome guy who lives two houses down and another one down the street. Neither of them live there now, but I still think about them. Most of the people who were here when I first moved in are still around. My neighborhood is pretty much like any other American suburb, you know? Lots of two-story houses, and every time the weather's nice, you hear kids playing outside. It's pretty quiet most days. I've never had any problems with anyone around here. You can be pretty much left alone unless you need something, which is nice. I've ordered tons of stuff online, and my packages have always been safe. I trust my neighbors. There's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my house. I've got tons of memories there. Me and the guys used to play basketball, football, and baseball there all the time.  I even got a pretty nasty elbow to the nose playing football, but those good times definitely outweigh the bad ones. Now, when I go there, it's mostly to hang out with my cousin's kids. They're way younger than me, and they still love going on swings and down slides. Just thinking about going there makes them so excited. The park makes me feel all nostalgic, you know?  My neighborhood is pretty diverse. There's all kinds of food around here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - you name it! But nowadays, most people just get their food delivered with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The most popular places are the fast food joints, which you can find pretty much anywhere. There are tons of pizza places, too. The stores around here have everything you could ever need. There are a bunch of dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is pretty popular around here. And some of them are even unique, like this Indian-owned store where you can get all the ingredients you need to make some awesome home-cooked Indian food, or even grab some ready-made meals. Overall, I love living here. Seeing all the crazy stories about neighbors on the news and social media makes me so thankful for the people around me.",
            "My little town, Johnston, is like a sweet little peach nestled in South Carolina. It ain't no fancy place, just a regular ol' town, but it's got a heart of gold, especially when it comes to peaches. They call it the Peach Capital of the World, and you know they take that seriously!  \n\nEverywhere you look, it's either peach trees as far as the eye can see or fields full of cows. The houses spread out like stars in the night sky, mostly two-story beauties with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or those classic gray shingles. Most of them ain't right on the road, they're tucked back in their own little world with fields out front for the animals or crops. \n\nThe whole town kinda revolves around this one stoplight, the heart of it all, where you'll find the only stores in town. Got your fast food fix at Hong Kong, the Chinese joint run by a family, Fiesta for some Mexican spice, or Gary's for a good ol' burger. Used to have a pizza place, but it closed down a while back, which is a real bummer.  There's Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny pharmacy known for their legendary Cherry Coca-Cola. And then there's IGA, the grocery store, kinda pricey but the only one around. Most folks go to Batesburg-Leesville for their big grocery hauls, though. \n\nBut the real star of the show is Dollar General! It's packed from morning till night with folks grabbing everyday essentials.  \n\nThen there's Possibilities Furniture & More, run by this sweet lady who's a fixture in town. She's been there forever and even has movers to deliver your purchases! Right next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where your furry friends can get pampered with baths, haircuts, and even daycare.\n\nThe doctor and vet are off the beaten path a little, but they're good folks, always there to help. And there's Johnston Elementary, where kids learn their ABCs until fifth grade. After that, they have to head to the next town for middle and high school. \n\nDon't expect any fancy parks or playgrounds here, but they're working on creating a little recreational area.  Truth be told, there ain't much to do in Johnston. No movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hang-out spots. But it's a good town, real friendly, and blink and you might just miss it!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was on a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit of a shocker, you know? I mean, every apartment in this area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I never heard a peep about anything like that, and neither did my friends. Maybe it's just life, I guess. I know a few friends who cry themselves to sleep at night, ya know? Things are tight, but we've learned to make do over the years. You start appreciating the dustiest of flea market toys, the worn-out clothes that smell like memories. You don't smell as much as an adult, I guess. Maybe you start smoking, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But the flea market always calls to you.  The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a piano, waiting to be played. It sinks into the leather, stays with you even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. You can start on one end and hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a madhouse, cars and people everywhere in the morning, but you wouldn't hear a thing in those thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, it's always quiet. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more of those. Cars and people, they just keep pouring in. It's a growing city, they say. Headquartered for one of the biggest online empires, you can see the pains of growing up.  Reminds me of New York, actually. Everyone's focused on their own thing, no one really expects much from you. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and folks will leave you be.  Not like back home, in the South, where a little concern means you care. People don't pry into your life here, not really. You can keep your walls up as long as you want, and the city just rolls on, like waves crashing on the beach. It's a lively place to be, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we're less like apartments of strangers and more like a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, help each other out when we can. I'm lucky to be here, I guess. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty good. I try to keep things clean, leave them food, and they do the same. We bring each other mail, stuff like that. It's nice to see them, and I think they like me being around, too. I live in this massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely screw up my life.",
            "My neighbourhood, well, it's like stepping into a picture postcard of suburbia, you know? Every nook and cranny screams \"cookie cutter\" and the homeowner's association is like the captain of this perfectly manicured ship.  \n\nJust picture this: neat, tidy single-family homes lining the streets, all looking like twins.  The front yards are basically carbon copies of each other - a patch of green grass, some decorative pebbles, and driveways that seem too short for two cars. You'll spot a few trees here and there, but not many.  It's all very... predictable. \n\nAnd speaking of predictability, the roads are always spotless! No potholes or cracks mar the freshly paved concrete.  Most houses are single-story, but occasionally you'll stumble upon a two-story beauty. \n\nBut forget those traditional mailboxes you see on TV, we do things differently here.  No individual boxes in front of each house, no sir! It's more like an apartment complex with a giant bank of mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a special key to open yours, and there are even bigger lockers for packages.  The HOA really loves their uniformity, you see.\n\nMy house sits on the edge of the city, so it's a bit of a hybrid - part suburbia, part country.  We have a lot of space, which means there are multiple community pools (they're gated and sparkling clean!) and walking trails perfect for a stroll with your dog or a peaceful evening walk.  You don't even need to go to a park to get your exercise in, just run around the neighborhood!\n\nMost of the people here are retired folks, which makes the area incredibly safe and friendly.  Everyone looks out for each other.   We also have a sprinkle of middle-aged and young professionals mixed in.\n\nThe city itself is surprisingly big, but it has that small-town charm.  We have all the necessary amenities, like a single mall (not huge, but it gets the job done!). It's a quick 15-minute drive to get to the bigger shopping centers, where you can find everything from fancy organic groceries to bargain stores with bare-bones staff and minimal selection.\n\nAll in all, my neighborhood is pretty typical, safe, well-maintained, and comfortable. We have pools, trails, and a sense of community. It's not right next to a bustling city center, but a short drive gets you there.",
            "My life here in this small town, tucked away just outside a big city, is kinda like a mixed bag, you know? Where we live, on the east side, it's not the fanciest place. Houses are older, mostly rented out, and things can get a bit rough around the edges. But honestly, it's not bad. People are friendly, always waving and saying hello. Sure, there's been some trouble, like a few shootings and even a murder, but it's not like it's constant. It's heartbreaking when something like that happens, like when our neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting.  For us, it's been mostly just the occasional thing going missing from our porch if we forget to bring it in.  \n\nBut the whole opioid thing, that's been tough on our town, like everywhere else, I guess. It's taken some good people from us. But thankfully, there's a lot of support here, with places to get help and programs for families dealing with this stuff.\n\nHonestly, there's a lot to love about this town too. My son goes to a fantastic elementary school. The teachers and the principal, they're all amazing. He's got some special needs, but he's never been bullied there, everyone is so accepting. They even have a great PTO that does all sorts of things to keep families involved.  Because a lot of folks here struggle financially, the school makes sure every kid gets breakfast and lunch, no questions asked. It's a real community effort, you know?\n\nThe town itself has been working hard to improve things, fixing up roads, parks, and making it look nicer. But it seems like most of the attention is focused on the west side, where the shopping is and everything. Our side, the east side, we're left behind a little bit.  \n\nOverall, I'm happy here. It's home. People are good, the schools are great, there's enough to do, and our house, well, it might not be worth much, but it's ours. We've been here for over 16 years, and I can't imagine leaving.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a real melting pot, you know?  It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings that have stories to tell. My apartment building is seven stories high, right across from this old theater that's seen its share of history.  Down the hill, just a block away, is this cool little bar that attracts all sorts of folks, especially on warm summer nights. You'll often see a line of people stretching down the block, especially on weeknights in June and July. A few blocks up is a park, a pretty decent-sized one for this part of town. It's fenced off with concrete, and there are these tall stairs built right into the wall. Come winter, when it gets really cold, you'll see homeless folks setting up their tents in neat little rows along the sidewalk and on those wide steps. It doesn't snow much here, but the rain in the middle of winter can be brutal.  They stay close together, right in the heart of the city, for warmth. Plus, it's not far to walk or take the bus to the nearest family center, where they can get a hot shower and a bit of a break.\n\nBut honestly, what I love most about this city isn't the old buildings or the history—though there's plenty of that. It's the people. You see, Hilltop used to be known as the most dangerous place on the West Coast, back in the day. Even now, thirty years later, you hear stories about the government agents and the DEA trying to clean up the streets. It's something that's woven into the fabric of this place, passed down from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me.  Even though people still say it's one of the rougher neighborhoods in the city, they work hard to keep it clean and safe. They care about what happens on their block, in their city.\n\nThey'll tell you not to walk around Hilltop after dark if you're white. I think that's just a remnant of the old days, a bit of outdated thinking. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who gets it. Someone who knows about the whispers of racism and prejudice that still linger, even in a place that's supposed to be a melting pot. \n\nOne thing's for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. There's a vibrancy here, a sense of community that I feel in my bones. I feel safe walking these streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where the laundromat owner will stay open late so I can charge my phone when I'm caught in a downpour. It's a place where I can sit huddled on a cold night, feeling invisible, only to have someone look me in the eye, hand me a five-dollar bill, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "My life unfolds in the heart of Rural America, in a quaint little town nestled in Michigan. It's a world where rolling farmlands gently transition into charming tourist spots. Forget about towering city malls, bustling Wal-marts, or even the familiar red brick facade of an Applebee's. Here, every adventure, every errand, requires a journey behind the wheel. But despite this quiet simplicity, I reside in a place of breathtaking beauty, embraced by the shimmering waters of two magnificent lakes: the vast expanse of Lake Michigan and the picturesque Lake Charlevoix. Every turn reveals a new beach, beckoning you to dip your toes into the cool embrace of the water.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the true essence of small-town charm. Houses aren't crammed together like sardines in a can; they stand proudly, each with its own unique story to tell. Some have been lovingly restored, their vintage charm enhanced with modern touches, while others retain their original character, whispering tales of bygone eras. Most have full basements, their presence evident from the street, and the siding often sports a classic aluminum sheen. \n\nMy block is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Gardens bursting with life, vibrant fences enclosing playful pets, and gleaming trampolines and swings in backyards – these are the hallmarks of our community. It's a tapestry woven with the threads of hard-working families, raising children who fill the streets with their laughter.\n\nThe pace of life here is gentle, a soothing melody of familiar sights and sounds. Children's laughter echoes through the streets, accompanied by the pitter-patter of dog paws and the gentle whir of bicycle wheels. Neighbors greet each other with friendly waves and smiles, a sense of belonging woven into the very fabric of our community. Well-manicured lawns, free from fallen leaves and overgrown weeds, reflect a pride in our homes and our shared space.\n\nThis isn't a neighborhood that boasts extravagant mansions or dazzling facades. Its beauty lies in its simplicity, its quiet strength, and the undeniable sense of safety and comfort it offers. It's a place where families flourish, where children are free to play, and where the worries of the world melt away.\n\nJust a stone's throw away, the county sheriff's department stands as a reassuring presence, a symbol of security. The health department and recycling center are close at hand, serving the needs of our community. The nearby baseball and softball fields buzz with the excitement of local games, while the small airport adds a touch of adventure to our daily lives, with the rumble of planes taking off and landing a constant reminder of the world beyond our borders. \n\nLife here is sweet, a symphony of everyday pleasures. A walk to the local ice cream parlor, a bike ride to the park – these are the simple joys that make our community special. It's a place where life unfolds at a slower pace, where neighbors become friends, and where the heart finds solace in the warmth of belonging."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood in this big city is a real mix of everything! Houses and stores are scattered around, like someone just threw them down randomly. You've got your usual shops and restaurants, but there are always new places popping up. Some are big chains, but I see more and more little, independent stores opening up too. They're everywhere, even on quiet streets, which makes it fun to explore. There are a couple of parks nearby, and it's adorable to see families with little kids playing there.\n\nNow, the people here are just as diverse as the places. There's a whole LGBTQ+ community, a group of Orthodox Jews, and even a bunch of people who came here from the former Soviet Union, all in one little area. \n\nIf you go a bit further out, you'll find even more different cultures. There's Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and tons more, all within a short drive...though,  \"short\" can be a bit relative in this city! Traffic can be brutal, especially during rush hour, so a 10-mile drive can take forever. \n\nIt's funny, because everyone drives everywhere, but nobody walks. There are things to see and do nearby, but this city is huge! People just don't want to walk that far.  So, we've got some of the worst traffic in the world and parking is a nightmare.  \n\nAnd get this: even with all the traffic and parking problems, they keep building more apartments! It seems like everyone wants to live here, but some people are worried about even more people and cars crowding the streets.\n\nBut hey, not everyone wants to live in a giant apartment building.  There are tons of houses of all sizes,  duplexes, and smaller apartment complexes.  It's a mix of everything, just like the people!\n\nThere are all ages here too, and to be honest, I don't really know most of my neighbors. It's not like the tight-knit neighborhood I grew up in, where I spent all my time playing outside with my friends. Back then, we were practically inseparable.",
            "My neighbourhood, its a real character, ya know? Most of the houses are those big ol' single family ones, but some folks have split theirs up, like joining two houses together, but still keeping them separate. My place has a little patch of grass out front and a tiny driveway to the side. It's like a snapshot from a time when living in the suburbs was the big dream, the American dream, you understand? It felt like everyone was chasing it back then, but now, it's like the dream's kinda slipping away. \n\nBut my neighbourhood, and a whole bunch of others like it, they're still holding on. They're shoutin' out, \"Hey, the dream's still alive!\" We're clingin' to it with all we got. Folks ain't as bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as they used to be, the lawns ain't quite as perfect, but there's still cars parkin' in every driveway, and kids playin' like the world's their own playground.  \n\nThat old school, been standin' for almost 90 years, it's still there, makin' dreams for the young'uns and bringin' back memories for the old-timers.  Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always buzzin'. Each house looks different, but they all kinda feel the same, like they got that same old soul.\n\nWe got this big supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by this big Yemeni family, they might be the only ones from around there in the whole neighbourhood. Mostly everyone else is African American. Streets are wide, kids playin' football like it's the only thing that matters, only stop when the cars come by. Most folks here have been here forever, got stories about the good ol' days when everyone knew everyone.\n\nUsed to be a karate school, but Hollywood stopped makin' those \"Karate Kid\" movies, so the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, guess drugs are the new craze. There's also this tiny movie theatre, shows old flicks for cheap. The young folks mock it, but the older folks love it, a night out without the kids, for a steal.\n\nWe got this one big highway runnin' through town, but the on-ramp and off-ramp are in the next town over. Back in the day, folks tried to get an exit here, but the young'uns wanted it, the old folks said it'd ruin the town, and well, they got their way. \n\nNow they're building a new high school, and we're tryin' to pick a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect fit for this place.",
            "Okay, so you might just breeze past this place, thinking it's nothin' special. It's tucked away behind some shops, not exactly the kind of spot you'd expect to find a whole community, ya know? But hang on, because if you sneak past the old, forgotten Whole Foods and wander behind those hotels that only get filled up once a year, maybe for family get-togethers, you'll stumble onto a whole world you never knew existed.  \n\nThere are these apartment buildings lined up like a bunch of Russian nesting dolls, all carefully taken apart and put back together in a row. Now, the first ones you see, they've been on the news for some shady stuff, so let's not dwell on those too much. But the ones next to them, and the ones after those, those are a whole different story. Almost nobody around here even knows they're there.  \n\nAcross from those apartments, you'll find a little community college branch - a quiet place with sleepy buildings, where students amble in with their coffee cups, yawning their way into the 7 AM morning. The iron gates creak open, letting them in one by one, while the commuters in their cars shake their fists and grumble about them holding up traffic on busy days. The road bumps into another residential street, with a park on one side and a place where people go to heal up after getting hurt. They call it a rehabilitation center, and it's got these cheerful porch chairs and a lazy ceiling fan that keeps the warm summer air moving. \n\nKids are running around in the park across the street, cartwheeling and spinning like crazy, while bees buzz around the flower patches by the road. Old folks walk their dogs, grumbling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls hanging out by the swings, chatting about boys and the latest TikTok trends.  There's a sushi place in a strip mall next to the park, with cheap eats but never too crowded. Right beside it is a swimming supply store, and stuck in between is a nail salon. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, and grab some hibachi chicken, all in one go – that's the beauty of a strip mall. There's even a frozen yogurt place there, the kind where you build your own sundae, and you see the teens from the park all the time, holding their cold, drippy cups of frozen yogurt while they try out tricks on their skateboards and puff away on their vapes, thinking they look super cool.  \n\nThis whole neighborhood, it's like a snapshot of America, a little piece of history in the sleepy south where things just stay the same, even time seems to slow down.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked, her voice tinged with wonder as we drove past endless rows of cornfields.  I knew she wouldn't understand this vast expanse. She came from a town where the grocery store was a stone's throw away, where life was a constant buzz of activity.  I smiled, taking her hand. \"This is it,\" I said, letting her feel the quiet hum of the countryside.\n\nShe gaped at the horizon, her eyes wide with a mixture of awe and disbelief. It was in these stretches of quiet, under the watchful gaze of the cornfields, that I truly felt at home. I told her stories of my childhood here in Ohio, of the summers filled with fireflies and the winters blanketed in snow. I painted pictures with my words, sharing the rhythm of life in a place where time seemed to move a little slower.\n\nWe passed a quarry, its water shimmering like a jewel in the sun. Just beyond it, nestled amongst the rolling hills, was my neighborhood. Brick and stucco homes, each with a sprawling yard, lined the roads.  People took pride in their gardens, bursting with color in the spring and autumn. Shiny Mercedes Benzes, gleaming after a good wash, lined the driveways, a testament to the success of those who called this place home.\n\nA friendly face greeted us as we neared my house. My Korean neighbor, a retired doctor, was always out tending his lawn, humming a tune as his mower hummed. We all loved his quirky ways, his sunny disposition never faltering, even as time etched lines on his face.  He was a reminder that life, despite its challenges, could still be filled with simple joys.\n\nMy house stood at the end of a quiet lane, its grey stucco walls blending with the surrounding landscape. Geese honked in the side yard, chased playfully by our energetic terrier.  In the backyard, a small stream gurgled, its melody punctuated by the croaking of bullfrogs and the distant moo of cows.\n\nA hand-built wooden bridge crossed the stream, leading to a secret oasis. A haven of trees, herbs, and wildflowers, it was here that I spent countless hours as a child. Building forts, chasing squirrels, exploring the woods - it was a world of endless possibilities.\n\nWinter transformed the landscape into a stark, beautiful canvas. The vibrant greens faded, replaced by a tapestry of browns and grays. Snow blanketed the world, transforming the ordinary into something magical. My sister and I would build snow forts, armed with snowballs and laughter. We'd carve out igloos, our makeshift arsenals filled with branches, our imaginations running wild.\n\nThose winters were tough, but they were also filled with a special kind of magic.  The snow brought a sense of wonder, a reminder that even in the coldest of times, there was beauty to be found.\n\nWe were just kids then, lost in our own little world. We didn't know anything about the world beyond the snow-covered fields and our backyard haven. We just knew that we had each other, and that was all that mattered.",
            "Ah, Portland, Oregon... You gotta understand what \"weird\" truly means here. It's not just a quirky badge, it's woven into the very fabric of the city. This idea, you see, is immortalized on a building that somehow manages to be a pizza place, a bar, a music venue, a strip club, and probably a few other things that could land its owner in hot water.  It says, \"Keep Portland Weird.\"  Some folks, they see it as a nostalgic shout-out to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time before it became a hot spot for Californians with deep pockets and a fondness for high-rise condos. They remember a Portland that was more hidden, more affordable, a breeding ground for unique and amazing subcultures. Others, well, they hear it as a siren song, a beckoning to a place where weird isn't just tolerated, it's celebrated.  \n\nBut let me tell you, even with all those fancy new condos popping up and the influx of folks from across the bridge, Portland still holds onto its weird.  \n\nNow, weird doesn't mean everyone's always cool with everything. It doesn't mean we don't have our share of modern problems and modern conveniences, like everyone else. We buy our stuff from China, just like the rest of the country. There are a million ways to be weird, to be outside the norm, but Portland has plenty of \"normal\" too. We've got our yoga enthusiasts, our hipsters, our business folks, the whole shebang.  Maybe \"weird\" just means we take it all a little less seriously. \n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. It's like a kaleidoscope of color. Houses painted in every shade imaginable, gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the sidewalks. And in the summertime, there's this magical thing called \"free boxes.\" They're filled with treasures,  clothes, books, you name it!  You never know what you'll find, but it's always a surprise.\n\nThat's the magic of walking through a neighborhood in Southeast Portland. It's about the unexpected, the embracing of the unusual. That's what Portland is all about to me, anyway.  But hey, I'm just one weird person among thousands. Some folks I know wouldn't dream of digging through a box on the sidewalk. They're off doing goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats!) or cheering on the Timbers (the city's soccer team). Portland is a melting pot of passions, dreams, and well, maybe a few too many beers at the bar.\n\nOf course, we're not perfect. Like anywhere else, we have our problems. Drugs are a struggle, often rooted in deeper mental health issues. The constant rain and gray skies might not help matters. And then there's homelessness, a problem that seems to have no easy solutions. We have good social services, which attract people in need, but they're not enough.\n\nThe non-homeless folks, they wrestle with feelings of compassion and frustration. We're not so weird after all, in that way.",
            "The mountains, they're always there. Up north, watching the sun rise and set every day.  Even when I'm caught up in work and life, forgetting about them, they're still there. Strong, steady, unbothered by all the craziness.  But on the days when I'm totally stressed out, when my heart is racing, those mountains call to me.  When I turn to them, they give me a sense of peace, a little strength to keep going.\n\nI first fell for them when I moved here for undergrad.  The mountains north of campus were the first thing that stole my breath away. Sure, the university has its own beauty with its buildings, ponds, and trees – they hold a special place in my heart too. But those mountains, they rule it all.\n\nThe town itself is pretty amazing. There are so many cute cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and studying. Just a short walk or bus ride away, you're in the downtown area, surrounded by old buildings with faded bricks, giving it this old-world charm. It's like a mini-city with its own hustle and bustle. But step past the library, and you're back in that peaceful small-town vibe. This mix of atmospheres, right next to each other, makes this place so special. It's like it's begging you to explore it.\n\nIt's easy to make lasting memories here.  Maybe it's walking past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or racing through downtown to catch a movie at that fancy theater the university gave us tickets to. But, like all places, there are tough memories too. The ponds, especially, are a good spot for both reflection and crying sessions at 2 am when you're having an existential crisis, which, let's be honest, I've done more than a few times.  \n\nWatching the turtles, ducks, and bugs just living their lives, each with their own purpose, makes me wonder about my own place in the world. Sometimes, I walk past the pond, past the park, past those little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I reach a main street.  Then, the sun shines its golden rays on the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I look up at the sunrise, I realize I'm walking north. And there they are, just like they always are. Those strong mountains, towering over everything else, touching the hazy blue and yellow sky. They don't say a word, but they remind me to keep going.",
            "Okay, so you're thinking of checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Finding it is a piece of cake! The subway is super easy to use here, and it's how most New Yorkers get around. Bensonhurst is definitely a city neighborhood, so you'll still be right in the heart of it all. \n\nOne thing that really stands out in Bensonhurst is all the Asian stores.  Over the past twenty years, a ton of Asian folks have moved here, so you'll practically see an Asian-owned shop on every block. Supermarkets and laundromats seem to be the most popular, and guess what? They're super loved by the locals! The food in the supermarkets is amazing, the prices are way better than other places, and it's just so convenient to have them right around the corner. I'm serious, there are like four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from where I live! Talk about convenient grocery shopping!\n\nNow, don't think Bensonhurst is only for Asians though. It's actually a really mixed bag of people, with immigrants, first-generation Americans, and second-generation Americans all living here. But, most of the bigger stores and businesses around are owned by Asians.\n\nOh, and there's this awesome park nearby that's been recently redone. It's got ten basketball courts, a huge field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for them to cool off in the summer. It's a real melting pot of people there, all playing and getting along great.\n\nYou won't find any giant corporate buildings in Bensonhurst. Mostly, it's co-op buildings or condos.  A lot of people live in two-family houses, too. The people here are generally pretty cool, but they can be loud! You'll hear cars blasting music all day long, and sometimes they even rev their engines so loud that it wakes you up in the morning.\n\nIf you're visiting at night, just be a little careful. Bensonhurst is safe for the most part, but you never know. There are some folks who like to cause trouble for no reason, and you might run into some bullies or even thieves. I've had a couple of run-ins with bullies in the past, but that was years ago.  Just recently, I heard about someone who had their package stolen, so be aware of that too.\n\nOne last thing - don't expect people to clean up after their dogs here. Even though there are fines for not doing so, nobody really seems to care.  Every day, you'll probably see dog poop on your way to the train station or the supermarket. It's my biggest pet peeve! Just be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "My neighborhood is kinda unique, ya know?  It's like everything slopes downward, and my house sits right at the top of the biggest hill around.  People call it the \"workout hill\" 'cause all the joggers love to run up it.  The thing is, there aren't any sidewalks, so everyone just walks on the road.  It's a bit bumpy in places, and honestly, kinda scary to drive on sometimes.  Plus, the power lines and phone lines are all tangled up and look kinda ancient.  We get a lot of rain and storms here, so branches and stuff always knock down the power lines.  They're always patching them up, which makes them look all patchworky. \n\nEverywhere you look, there are these giant evergreen trees.  But, here's the kicker, everyone hates them!  They try to chop them down as much as possible because they block the view of the ocean.  That's why so many houses are built way up on the hill, with these huge windows on the second floor just to catch a glimpse of the bay.\n\nSunsets are pretty amazing though. The water lights up from below, and the sky turns this fiery orange.  But, it's usually cloudy, so you mostly see the sun through this hazy veil.  It's pretty much overcast and damp most of the time.  Moss grows on everything – roofs, cars, even railings!  Once, I left my car in the driveway for a month, and it was practically covered in green, furry moss. Took me forever to scrape it all off.\n\nThere aren't many kids around here. There's a school just a few blocks away, but most of the people are older folks, mostly retired.  Instead of kids, they have dogs. You see them everywhere - hanging out in lawns or chasing each other down the street.  Be careful if you leave a door or window open, 'cause they'll sneak right in! I found one once in my living room and had to shoo him out. \n\nRabbits are a bit of a nuisance too. They're pretty big and gardeners hate them because they dig up plants and burrow in lawns.  My cats, though, they love a good rabbit hunt and have practically cleared them out of the neighborhood.  We also have the usual birds – sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off.\n\nThere aren't any stores around here, but if you hike down to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving up fresh seafood. The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks along the shore are fun to chuck into the water. The bay isn't very wide – you can see the other side even through the mist most days.",
            "Y'all, let me tell you about my little corner of the world, right here in a quiet little town in Tennessee.  We're talkin' a real sleepy suburb, nestled between two big ol' highways. That means we get a bit more traffic than a fella might like, but other than that, it's peaceful as can be. Folks around here mostly keep to themselves, tending to their yards and such.  Wintertime, though, that's when the fun begins! We got a little hill right off our street, perfect for sledding. We live smack dab on the corner, so we see everybody comin' and goin'.  We know all the folks around here, their cars, their dogs, the whole shebang.  Whenever we see somethin' new rollin' through, well, we take notice.  Some folks like to take walks, stretch their legs, or just let their dogs sniff around. Kids on bikes, the usual kid stuff, you know?  We're homebodies at heart, workin' from home ourselves. It's just me, my wife, and our two little girls, eleven and fourteen.  So, folks are used to seein' us pop in and out, just livin' our lives.\n\nWe love to get outside, rain or shine!  Sometimes we fire up the grill on our back deck, and the smell of barbecue just fills the air.  You can't help but smile when that happens. Seems like there's always somebody mowin' their lawn around here, 'specially between March and October when that grass grows like crazy. We got a whole lotta trees around, 'cause this place used to be woods.  It's pretty shady, but come Fall, we're knee-deep in leaves. That means rakin' and burnin' 'em up, which I gotta say, smells mighty good. It's like Fall's official scent!\n\nLately, we ain't had much of a winter, so it feels like Fall's just hangin' around for dear life. Our garage is in the back, so we mostly use the front door when someone comes knockin', which ain't very often. I like to tinker in the garage on my truck or other projects.  When those garage doors are up, I feel like I'm right in the middle of it all.  Holidays are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving brings some family from out of town and cars are parked everywhere. Same goes for Mother's Day and Christmas.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't trade this place for the world. If it weren't for those pesky highways, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood, it's right smack dab in the middle of the high desert, ya know?  Dirt, dirt, and more dirt.  Unless you've lived here, it's hard to understand that feeling, always seeing brown.  And when you do see a green lawn, you just know that person is spending a fortune on keeping it that way.  Back when I first moved here in the 90s, the houses were spread out, wide open spaces. Now, it's getting a bit more crowded, lots of new houses popping up.  Honestly, it feels more like a city every day, but I guess that's how things go everywhere these days.  \n\nThe people here are mostly friendly, though, like anywhere, you've got your good and your bad.  I'm surrounded by really nice old folks, so I guess you could say it's a pretty decent neighborhood.  \n\nAs for stores, it's mostly the big chain stores you see everywhere: Food 4 Less, Smart & Final, that kind of thing.  If you want something more upscale, you gotta drive a bit.  Never see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here.  \n\nLooking around, most jobs seem to be in construction.  I figure that's because the city's still growing, lots of open land to build on.  It kind of scares me, though.  I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not looking to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living, actually.  Drywall and T-bar installation.   \n\nWhat I love about this place is all the critters.  People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert itself is a big draw.  It's a tough environment, but it has its own unique charm and it's home to all kinds of amazing wildlife.  We humans gotta learn to share this space with them and live together peacefully.\n\nMy family and I have gotten used to sharing our home with the wildlife. I got three kids, and they're totally obsessed with lizards and desert bugs! Right now, as I'm typing this, they're outside trying to catch some. \n\nThere are a few things to do around here, too.  Victorville is a good place for families, especially if you want a different kind of experience.  If you're visiting, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair - it's a blast!  And if you head up to Wrightwood nearby, you can see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons.\n\nWant to learn more about the desert's history and nature? The Victor Valley Museum has some great stuff - rocks, fossils, Native American artifacts, and old stuff from Victorville's past.",
            "Hmm, describing my neighborhood is kinda different from what everyone else might say.  While they probably talk about houses and backyards, my neighborhood is the college campus I call home. My dorm mates are my community, and the whole campus is my stomping ground.  It's a bit unique, I know, but it still has those neighborhood vibes. You've got your \"houses,\" your people, your shops, and even a park. Let me break it down for you.\n\nFirst, the \"houses\" - we've got apartments, actual houses for rent, and those classic dorm rooms.  Apartments have a few people per room, maybe 4 or 6 rooms per floor, with a couple of floors in a building. That's like 20 people in each building, give or take. Then there are the houses, more like family homes, mostly for alumni,  but not many of those around. And lastly, the dorm rooms, where most of us live – two people sharing, tons of students, the whole shebang.\n\nMy school is all about diversity, and that's what makes my neighborhood so interesting. You've got people from all walks of life, all ages. The staff usually live in those houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones grab the apartments. It's a melting pot, really.\n\nAnd let's not forget the shops and the park!  We've got all sorts of places to eat, campus-branded clothes and groceries - you name it, we've got it! And the park? It's our little oasis, lively and safe, thanks to everyone looking out for each other.\n\nSo yeah, my neighborhood might be a bit different, but it's got all the heart and soul of any good community.",
            "Hmm...my heart goes out to my old neighbourhood, Stockbridge. Ten years have flown by since we moved from Riverdale. I gotta admit, when we first arrived, it felt like a punch to the gut.  I missed my friends back in Riverdale, they were family to me. But my folks, bless their hearts, wanted the best for us. They thought Stockbridge would be a fresh start, a place where we could shine. A better school, a nicer house, you know, all that jazz.  \n\nIt took time, but I adjusted. Made some new friends, some who became super close, and some, well, let's just say they weren't so great.  Truth be told, I never really got to know most of the neighbours, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis for a bit, since they lived right next door. They're like family to me, so warm and welcoming. I'll never forget Mr. Glen's wedding (his second time down the aisle!). It was a blast, a real party. I even caught his wife's garter! Wish I'd snagged the bouquet too though. We danced the night away, and had a great time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her in ages, hope she's doing well.\n\nThis neighbourhood's a bit of a labyrinth, but I've got a GPS now, so I'm slowly exploring every nook and cranny.  Most of my adventures have been with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We were inseparable, spending hours glued to video games, just living life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd escape to the park, soak in the fresh air, let nature soothe my soul. It's my happy place. I even practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken (wooden sword) sometimes. The park also has a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't touched a racket or ball in ages. Still cool to have them there for when I feel like dusting off the old skills. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a blast, even though he pushed us hard! \n\nLooking back, I've made so many memories here, so many stories I could tell. But these are the ones that stick out: the warmth of Mr. Glen's family, the nights with Kason and Curtis, and the peace I find in the park. Stockbridge will always hold a special place in my heart. And you know what? I think the best is yet to come!",
            "Hmm...my current digs are pretty close to my school, which is a major plus. Mostly, it's all apartments around here, but there are a few little eateries and watering holes that are fun to hang out at, and they won't break the bank either. One of those bars just got a new name, and now it's a bit pricier, but the drinks and service are still decent. Most folks are alright, either students or folks who are on a tighter budget, since the apartments aren't too fancy.  There are quite a few kiddos around, thanks to the elementary school just a hop, skip, and a jump away. I don't really know my neighbors, and to be honest, I'm not too keen on getting to know them either. They seem to be bigtime weed enthusiasts, so the building management put an air freshener right by their door. My boyfriend and I found it hilarious, almost like a slap in the face, you know?  The buildings around here are kinda old-fashioned, but some of them have probably been spruced up inside.  \n\nDown the street, there are these brand-spanking-new apartments, but I'm not a fan. They look cheap, even if the rent is sky-high. It's a total rip-off, but because they're near campus, the management can get away with it. Speaking of places to eat, there's this super cheap joint about five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates, and most of it is microwaved. Across the street from there is a gas station, and I heard working there is a nightmare. However, thanks to some city dough, they redid the road last summer. Now, there's a wide sidewalk, lots of grass on the sides, and the whole area looks a bit more polished. \n\nMy building is covered in trees, though they chopped down a few, leaving some stumps. There are way more trees where I live compared to down the road. Behind my complex is a row of trees, and then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd street, but behind me is 43rd, and that one isn't as charming. The sidewalks are practically falling apart, and the buildings look pretty shabby. There are a lot of trees there too, probably trying to hide the state of things. Most of the crime in the area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I guess you can't blame them entirely. There are some other apartments across from me that have their fair share of crime and a revolving door of residents. \n\nBut honestly, I kind of like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of things I need nearby. I especially love that the university is just a walk away, and there are two bus stops that make it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is like a little slice of heaven, hidden away on a cul-de-sac. Each house is a duplex, spaced out so they look like individual homes.  They all wear the same sunny yellow paint and white porches, topped with bright green metal roofs. Almost everyone here knows each other, like a big, friendly family. Sometimes, we gather at the end of the road - no one really decides to meet, it just happens - and chat while the little ones play. It's so peaceful here, a real escape from all the hustle and bustle of the modern world. Feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees, with a big blue sky above and fluffy white clouds drifting by.\n\nBut even in this idyllic place, things can change in a flash. We've had tornado warnings lately, and last night, the sirens actually went off!  We all scurried for shelter. I grabbed my baby dog, my purse, and a couple of pillows and headed for the bathtub, feeling a little silly but safe. My big dog, well, he wasn't so keen on the idea of a bathroom bunker and stayed in the living room, whining and barking. Outside, the storm raged, with giant hailstones pounding the ground. After it passed, the road was literally steaming!  The temperature dropped from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes, and the hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. \n\nAs the clouds parted, the sun came out and the sky burst into a double rainbow. I rushed inside for my camera, snapping pictures to share with my family and friends. Everyone was amazed, just like me. The neighborhood stayed quiet for a while, with everyone probably still in shock.  Then, things went back to normal – moms and kids back outside, dinner cooking, the friendly chatter resuming. My heart swells with gratitude for finding this wonderful community.  \n\nIt’s such a joy living here,  especially after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina.  Though everyone has the same two-bed, two-bath apartments, each home is unique inside. Some are tiny, which seems odd. But hey, that's part of the charm!\n\nI love to walk through the big field behind my place down to the pond (no swimming allowed, though!). I’ve seen deer there and in the mornings, a giant bullfrog serenades me with his song. It's a beautiful place to live, just a hop, skip, and a jump from Charlotte. Every morning starts with the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like a little village, with a donkey at a nearby farm braying in the evenings.\n\nI'm so lucky to have found this little piece of paradise.",
            "Hmm...my heart n soui went to this neighborhood right as I was starting eighth grade. It was kinda hard to make friends at first, but then I met this awesome guy who lives two houses down and another one down the street. Neither of them live there now, but I still think about them. Most of the people who were here when I first moved in are still around. My neighborhood is pretty much like any other American suburb, you know? Lots of two-story houses, and every time the weather's nice, you hear kids playing outside. It's pretty quiet most days. I've never had any problems with anyone around here. You can be pretty much left alone unless you need something, which is nice. I've ordered tons of stuff online, and my packages have always been safe. I trust my neighbors. There's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my house. I've got tons of memories there. Me and the guys used to play basketball, football, and baseball there all the time.  I even got a pretty nasty elbow to the nose playing football, but those good times definitely outweigh the bad ones. Now, when I go there, it's mostly to hang out with my cousin's kids. They're way younger than me, and they still love going on swings and down slides. Just thinking about going there makes them so excited. The park makes me feel all nostalgic, you know?  My neighborhood is pretty diverse. There's all kinds of food around here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - you name it! But nowadays, most people just get their food delivered with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The most popular places are the fast food joints, which you can find pretty much anywhere. There are tons of pizza places, too. The stores around here have everything you could ever need. There are a bunch of dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is pretty popular around here. And some of them are even unique, like this Indian-owned store where you can get all the ingredients you need to make some awesome home-cooked Indian food, or even grab some ready-made meals. Overall, I love living here. Seeing all the crazy stories about neighbors on the news and social media makes me so thankful for the people around me.",
            "My little town, Johnston, is like a sweet little peach nestled in South Carolina. It ain't no fancy place, just a regular ol' town, but it's got a heart of gold, especially when it comes to peaches. They call it the Peach Capital of the World, and you know they take that seriously!  \n\nEverywhere you look, it's either peach trees as far as the eye can see or fields full of cows. The houses spread out like stars in the night sky, mostly two-story beauties with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or those classic gray shingles. Most of them ain't right on the road, they're tucked back in their own little world with fields out front for the animals or crops. \n\nThe whole town kinda revolves around this one stoplight, the heart of it all, where you'll find the only stores in town. Got your fast food fix at Hong Kong, the Chinese joint run by a family, Fiesta for some Mexican spice, or Gary's for a good ol' burger. Used to have a pizza place, but it closed down a while back, which is a real bummer.  There's Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny pharmacy known for their legendary Cherry Coca-Cola. And then there's IGA, the grocery store, kinda pricey but the only one around. Most folks go to Batesburg-Leesville for their big grocery hauls, though. \n\nBut the real star of the show is Dollar General! It's packed from morning till night with folks grabbing everyday essentials.  \n\nThen there's Possibilities Furniture & More, run by this sweet lady who's a fixture in town. She's been there forever and even has movers to deliver your purchases! Right next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where your furry friends can get pampered with baths, haircuts, and even daycare.\n\nThe doctor and vet are off the beaten path a little, but they're good folks, always there to help. And there's Johnston Elementary, where kids learn their ABCs until fifth grade. After that, they have to head to the next town for middle and high school. \n\nDon't expect any fancy parks or playgrounds here, but they're working on creating a little recreational area.  Truth be told, there ain't much to do in Johnston. No movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hang-out spots. But it's a good town, real friendly, and blink and you might just miss it!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was on a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit of a shocker, you know? I mean, every apartment in this area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I never heard a peep about anything like that, and neither did my friends. Maybe it's just life, I guess. I know a few friends who cry themselves to sleep at night, ya know? Things are tight, but we've learned to make do over the years. You start appreciating the dustiest of flea market toys, the worn-out clothes that smell like memories. You don't smell as much as an adult, I guess. Maybe you start smoking, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But the flea market always calls to you.  The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a piano, waiting to be played. It sinks into the leather, stays with you even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. You can start on one end and hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a madhouse, cars and people everywhere in the morning, but you wouldn't hear a thing in those thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, it's always quiet. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more of those. Cars and people, they just keep pouring in. It's a growing city, they say. Headquartered for one of the biggest online empires, you can see the pains of growing up.  Reminds me of New York, actually. Everyone's focused on their own thing, no one really expects much from you. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and folks will leave you be.  Not like back home, in the South, where a little concern means you care. People don't pry into your life here, not really. You can keep your walls up as long as you want, and the city just rolls on, like waves crashing on the beach. It's a lively place to be, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we're less like apartments of strangers and more like a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, help each other out when we can. I'm lucky to be here, I guess. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty good. I try to keep things clean, leave them food, and they do the same. We bring each other mail, stuff like that. It's nice to see them, and I think they like me being around, too. I live in this massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely screw up my life.",
            "My neighbourhood, well, it's like stepping into a picture postcard of suburbia, you know? Every nook and cranny screams \"cookie cutter\" and the homeowner's association is like the captain of this perfectly manicured ship.  \n\nJust picture this: neat, tidy single-family homes lining the streets, all looking like twins.  The front yards are basically carbon copies of each other - a patch of green grass, some decorative pebbles, and driveways that seem too short for two cars. You'll spot a few trees here and there, but not many.  It's all very... predictable. \n\nAnd speaking of predictability, the roads are always spotless! No potholes or cracks mar the freshly paved concrete.  Most houses are single-story, but occasionally you'll stumble upon a two-story beauty. \n\nBut forget those traditional mailboxes you see on TV, we do things differently here.  No individual boxes in front of each house, no sir! It's more like an apartment complex with a giant bank of mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a special key to open yours, and there are even bigger lockers for packages.  The HOA really loves their uniformity, you see.\n\nMy house sits on the edge of the city, so it's a bit of a hybrid - part suburbia, part country.  We have a lot of space, which means there are multiple community pools (they're gated and sparkling clean!) and walking trails perfect for a stroll with your dog or a peaceful evening walk.  You don't even need to go to a park to get your exercise in, just run around the neighborhood!\n\nMost of the people here are retired folks, which makes the area incredibly safe and friendly.  Everyone looks out for each other.   We also have a sprinkle of middle-aged and young professionals mixed in.\n\nThe city itself is surprisingly big, but it has that small-town charm.  We have all the necessary amenities, like a single mall (not huge, but it gets the job done!). It's a quick 15-minute drive to get to the bigger shopping centers, where you can find everything from fancy organic groceries to bargain stores with bare-bones staff and minimal selection.\n\nAll in all, my neighborhood is pretty typical, safe, well-maintained, and comfortable. We have pools, trails, and a sense of community. It's not right next to a bustling city center, but a short drive gets you there.",
            "My life here in this small town, tucked away just outside a big city, is kinda like a mixed bag, you know? Where we live, on the east side, it's not the fanciest place. Houses are older, mostly rented out, and things can get a bit rough around the edges. But honestly, it's not bad. People are friendly, always waving and saying hello. Sure, there's been some trouble, like a few shootings and even a murder, but it's not like it's constant. It's heartbreaking when something like that happens, like when our neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting.  For us, it's been mostly just the occasional thing going missing from our porch if we forget to bring it in.  \n\nBut the whole opioid thing, that's been tough on our town, like everywhere else, I guess. It's taken some good people from us. But thankfully, there's a lot of support here, with places to get help and programs for families dealing with this stuff.\n\nHonestly, there's a lot to love about this town too. My son goes to a fantastic elementary school. The teachers and the principal, they're all amazing. He's got some special needs, but he's never been bullied there, everyone is so accepting. They even have a great PTO that does all sorts of things to keep families involved.  Because a lot of folks here struggle financially, the school makes sure every kid gets breakfast and lunch, no questions asked. It's a real community effort, you know?\n\nThe town itself has been working hard to improve things, fixing up roads, parks, and making it look nicer. But it seems like most of the attention is focused on the west side, where the shopping is and everything. Our side, the east side, we're left behind a little bit.  \n\nOverall, I'm happy here. It's home. People are good, the schools are great, there's enough to do, and our house, well, it might not be worth much, but it's ours. We've been here for over 16 years, and I can't imagine leaving.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a real melting pot, you know?  It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings that have stories to tell. My apartment building is seven stories high, right across from this old theater that's seen its share of history.  Down the hill, just a block away, is this cool little bar that attracts all sorts of folks, especially on warm summer nights. You'll often see a line of people stretching down the block, especially on weeknights in June and July. A few blocks up is a park, a pretty decent-sized one for this part of town. It's fenced off with concrete, and there are these tall stairs built right into the wall. Come winter, when it gets really cold, you'll see homeless folks setting up their tents in neat little rows along the sidewalk and on those wide steps. It doesn't snow much here, but the rain in the middle of winter can be brutal.  They stay close together, right in the heart of the city, for warmth. Plus, it's not far to walk or take the bus to the nearest family center, where they can get a hot shower and a bit of a break.\n\nBut honestly, what I love most about this city isn't the old buildings or the history—though there's plenty of that. It's the people. You see, Hilltop used to be known as the most dangerous place on the West Coast, back in the day. Even now, thirty years later, you hear stories about the government agents and the DEA trying to clean up the streets. It's something that's woven into the fabric of this place, passed down from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me.  Even though people still say it's one of the rougher neighborhoods in the city, they work hard to keep it clean and safe. They care about what happens on their block, in their city.\n\nThey'll tell you not to walk around Hilltop after dark if you're white. I think that's just a remnant of the old days, a bit of outdated thinking. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who gets it. Someone who knows about the whispers of racism and prejudice that still linger, even in a place that's supposed to be a melting pot. \n\nOne thing's for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. There's a vibrancy here, a sense of community that I feel in my bones. I feel safe walking these streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where the laundromat owner will stay open late so I can charge my phone when I'm caught in a downpour. It's a place where I can sit huddled on a cold night, feeling invisible, only to have someone look me in the eye, hand me a five-dollar bill, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "My life unfolds in the heart of Rural America, in a quaint little town nestled in Michigan. It's a world where rolling farmlands gently transition into charming tourist spots. Forget about towering city malls, bustling Wal-marts, or even the familiar red brick facade of an Applebee's. Here, every adventure, every errand, requires a journey behind the wheel. But despite this quiet simplicity, I reside in a place of breathtaking beauty, embraced by the shimmering waters of two magnificent lakes: the vast expanse of Lake Michigan and the picturesque Lake Charlevoix. Every turn reveals a new beach, beckoning you to dip your toes into the cool embrace of the water.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the true essence of small-town charm. Houses aren't crammed together like sardines in a can; they stand proudly, each with its own unique story to tell. Some have been lovingly restored, their vintage charm enhanced with modern touches, while others retain their original character, whispering tales of bygone eras. Most have full basements, their presence evident from the street, and the siding often sports a classic aluminum sheen. \n\nMy block is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Gardens bursting with life, vibrant fences enclosing playful pets, and gleaming trampolines and swings in backyards – these are the hallmarks of our community. It's a tapestry woven with the threads of hard-working families, raising children who fill the streets with their laughter.\n\nThe pace of life here is gentle, a soothing melody of familiar sights and sounds. Children's laughter echoes through the streets, accompanied by the pitter-patter of dog paws and the gentle whir of bicycle wheels. Neighbors greet each other with friendly waves and smiles, a sense of belonging woven into the very fabric of our community. Well-manicured lawns, free from fallen leaves and overgrown weeds, reflect a pride in our homes and our shared space.\n\nThis isn't a neighborhood that boasts extravagant mansions or dazzling facades. Its beauty lies in its simplicity, its quiet strength, and the undeniable sense of safety and comfort it offers. It's a place where families flourish, where children are free to play, and where the worries of the world melt away.\n\nJust a stone's throw away, the county sheriff's department stands as a reassuring presence, a symbol of security. The health department and recycling center are close at hand, serving the needs of our community. The nearby baseball and softball fields buzz with the excitement of local games, while the small airport adds a touch of adventure to our daily lives, with the rumble of planes taking off and landing a constant reminder of the world beyond our borders. \n\nLife here is sweet, a symphony of everyday pleasures. A walk to the local ice cream parlor, a bike ride to the park – these are the simple joys that make our community special. It's a place where life unfolds at a slower pace, where neighbors become friends, and where the heart finds solace in the warmth of belonging."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Hmm...my heart goes thump-thump every time I think about my neighborhood. It's like a giant melting pot, you know? Houses and shops are all mixed up, like someone threw them in a blender and hit 'shuffle.' There are these big, fancy stores everyone knows, but also these little shops that are popping up everywhere. You can walk down the street and suddenly find yourself staring at a cute boutique, like a little secret hidden in plain sight. And speaking of secrets, there are parks tucked away in the middle of it all, where families go to play. It's like a little oasis in the city jungle.\n\nNow, the people in my neighborhood, oh my gosh, they're a story in themselves! You've got your LGBTQ+ folks, your Orthodox Jews, even folks who came from faraway places like the old Soviet Union. It's like a microcosm of the whole world, right here in my backyard. And if you go a little further out, you'll find even more communities, like Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia...it's like a journey around the world without ever leaving the city!\n\nThe only problem is, getting around can be a nightmare. Traffic is insane, and finding a parking spot is like winning the lottery. People here practically live in their cars. They don't walk anywhere, even if it's just a few blocks away. It's sad, really. It's like we've forgotten how to enjoy the simple things, like a stroll down the street.\n\nBut hey, at least there's always something new being built. They're putting up these giant apartment buildings everywhere, which means more people, more cars, more chaos. But hey, someone's gotta live in them, right?\n\nSpeaking of living, there are all sorts of places to call home here. You've got your big apartments, your cozy houses, even those tiny little condos that look like dollhouses. It's a bit of a mix, and I guess that's what makes it interesting.\n\nAnd the people? Well, you know, there's a whole lot of us, but we're not exactly close-knit. Back when I was a kid, we used to play outside all the time, but now everyone's got their heads down, staring at their phones. It's a shame, really.",

Most of the houses are like those classic single-family homes, but some folks have split their place into two, still attached though, kinda like a friendly twin thing. My house has a small patch of grass out front and a tiny driveway on the side. It's like a time capsule, reminding you of that whole \"American Dream\" thing, back when it felt like everyone was reaching for it. Now, it's like the dream's kind of drifting away from some folks, but not us. We're still holding on, clinging to it as tight as we can.\n\nYou can tell the folks here aren't as starry-eyed as they used to be. The little yards aren't as manicured, but there's still a car or two in every driveway. The kids are out playing, like the whole world's their playground. The old public school, practically a hundred years old, still stands tall, giving the young ones hope for the future while reminding the older folks of simpler times.  \n\nThere aren't many churches around, most are empty these days, but the basketball courts are always buzzing.  Every house looks different, but they all have that familiar feel, like they're part of the same family.

The kids wouldn't be caught dead there, but the older folks love it, a cheap night out without the kids, you know?\n\nWe've got one main road that cuts through, an expressway, but the on and off ramps are in the next town over. We tried to get an exit for our town, the kids were all for it, but the older folks said it would ruin everything.  They got their way, convinced the city council to say no.

But if you dare to venture behind the old, forgotten Whole Foods and peek past those hotels that only stir to life for occasional family reunions, you'll stumble upon a hidden world teeming with activity.  There, nestled among these streets, are a handful of apartment complexes, stacked together like Russian nesting dolls, carefully disassembled and arranged in a neat line.\n\nNow, the first apartments you encounter might have earned some unwanted notoriety, so let's not dwell on those.

Meanwhile, commuters honk their horns and grumble about the traffic delays on busy mornings.\n\nThe road splits, leading to another residential street. On one side, a park bustles with life.

            "\"Where in the world is everything?\" she asked, her voice laced with surprise as we passed the endless rows of corn stretching out before us like an ocean. I chuckled, knowing she wouldn't quite grasp the vastness of it all.  She came from a town where the grocery store was just a hop, skip, and a jump away. Open spaces like this were simply unheard of.  So, I started telling her about my childhood in rural Ohio, about growing up surrounded by fields and fields of corn. As I spoke, I saw a glimmer of understanding in her eyes.  Finally, she was getting a glimpse into who I was, where I came from.\n\nWe continued down the two-lane highway, past a shimmering quarry now filled with water. Just beyond it, nestled amongst the cornfields, lay my little development. It was a quiet place, with brick and stucco houses, each one boasting at least half an acre of land that folks took pride in keeping immaculate. Come springtime, the yards burst with color, blooming with flowers and adorned with trees that painted themselves in a new hue with each passing season.  And everywhere you looked, gleaming Mercedes Benz cars, their paint sparkling in the midday sun after a good old-fashioned car wash.\n\nAs we neared my house, I spotted my Korean neighbor, always outside with a wave and a friendly smile.  He spent his days tending to his lawn, the hum of his mower accompanied by his cheerful singing.  Everyone got a good laugh out of it, but he was a genuinely kind soul with a fascinating past. He'd been a doctor, you see, but now his days were spent blending in with the grass, his John Deere Zero Turn mower his chariot. \n\nFinally, we pulled up to my grey stucco house. In the side yard, a gaggle of geese honked and herded around our terrier, while our backyard boasted a small stream that flowed into the quarry. The sounds of bullfrogs, the gentle gurgling of the water, and the occasional \"moo\" from a nearby farm filled the air. Across a handmade wooden bridge was a secret oasis, untouched and wild, filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood playground, the place where I built tree forts, \"hunted\" animals (mostly chasing them), and spent countless hours with neighborhood friends.\n\nWinters here were something else entirely. The green would fade, leaving a stark, empty landscape. The trees, once bursting with vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers, stood bare, their branches reaching towards the sky like skeletal fingers. But when snow fell, it transformed everything into a winter wonderland. Snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen dotted the backyard. We fought like cats and dogs as kids, and during winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We built massive igloo-like forts, our arsenals stocked with branches. In our own little world, we played pretend, lost in a time where nothing else mattered. We were just kids, carefree and happy.",
            "Hmm...Portland, Oregon, it's got a vibe, you know? Like, they've got this thing, this slogan, plastered on a building that's kinda like, a pizza place, a bar, a music spot, maybe even a little bit naughty, you get me? It says, \"Keep Portland Weird.\"  Some folks, they see it as a throwback, like remembering the old Portland, back when it was quieter, less crowded, and more of a secret. Where all these cool, unique groups popped up. But for others, it's like, a welcome mat, a whisper saying, \"Come on in, be weird here, we'll love you for it.\" And even with all the fancy Californians moving in and building shiny new towers, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.\n\nIt's not that everyone's always accepting, mind you. But it's about accepting the things that don't fit in, the things that make you go, \"Hmm, that's interesting.\"  It's like, we're not rejecting the modern stuff, we have our iPhones and online shopping just like everyone else. But somehow, we're just a little more...unconventional.  We've got yoga studios, hipsters, and suits in the same neighborhood. Maybe it's just that we don't take things too seriously here.\n\nIn my neighborhood, anyway, you see these crazy colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers and veggies lining the streets. And in the summer, there are these free boxes, see? Cardboard boxes, sometimes plastic bags, filled with random treasures. Clothes, books, who knows what else! It's like a scavenger hunt, a little surprise waiting for you around every corner. That's what Portland's all about, at least to me.  We're a bunch of different kinds of weird, all living together. Some folks find free boxes a little too much, they'd rather be at goat yoga or cheering on the Timbers. \n\nBut hey, Portland's got something for everyone. People chasing dreams, people dreaming about dreams, people who love soccer, people who love goats, people who love...well, you get the picture. We've got our problems, sure. Drugs, homelessness, the usual stuff. But we're working on it, trying to figure it out, just like everyone else.  It's not always pretty, but it's real. And that's what makes Portland, well, Portland.",
            "The mountains, they are always there.  Up north, watching the sun rise and set every single day.  No matter how busy life gets, how much I forget about them, they're still there.  Solid, strong, not bothered by all the chaos going on down here. Then, when I'm stressed out, feeling all tangled up inside, they seem to call out to me. And when I look at them, they quiet my worries, giving me a little strength to keep going, one step at a time. I first came here when I started college. Those mountains north of campus, they were the first thing that really caught my eye. Sure, the university itself is pretty amazing, with its buildings and ponds and trees, each with its own special place in my heart. But the mountains, they take the prize. The town itself is lovely, don't get me wrong. There are tons of cafes where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and study sessions.  A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where old, faded brick buildings line the streets of restaurants and shops. It's like stepping back in time, with all the energy and buzz of a big city.  But just a few blocks away, you're back in the peaceful, quiet town, just past the library. This mix of vibes, so close together, makes this place feel magical, like it's waiting to be discovered. It's easy to make memories here, good and bad.  Like walking past the old swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or rushing through the busy downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater, tickets courtesy of the university. But it's also where some tough memories live. The ponds, especially, are great for both reflecting and crying at 2 am when you're having an existential crisis (which, trust me, I've had a few). Watching turtles and ducks and bugs go about their lives, each with a purpose, makes you wonder about your own place in the world. So, I'd walk past the pond, past the park, past the little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I reached the main street. And there it was, the sunrise, painting the sky with its brilliant colours as the sun shone on the palm trees.  I was walking north. Of course, I was.  There they were, the mountains, just as they'd always been.  They towered over everything else, touching the hazy blue and yellow sky.  And without saying a word, they reminded me to keep going, to be strong.",
            "Hmm...Visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Finding it won't be a problem, trust me! The subway, it runs like a charm, just like everywhere else in New York City. You'll know you're still in the Big Apple, that's for sure. Now, get ready for a feast for the eyes, because you'll see Asian stores practically on every corner.  \n\nOver the last few decades, Bensonhurst has become a real melting pot, especially with all these awesome folks from Asia moving in.  Everywhere you look, it seems like an Asian-owned store, from supermarkets to laundromats, popping up like magic.  And let me tell you, locals absolutely love them!  The food is top-notch, the prices are sweeter than honey, and let's not forget, oh-so-convenient! I swear, there are four Asian supermarkets within a stone's throw from my place! Imagine that!\n\nBut hey, don't think Bensonhurst is just about Asian folks, okay? It's a real mix of everyone, from recent arrivals to those who've been here for generations.  You've got your big Asian-owned businesses, sure, but there's also this brand new park nearby that's a real gem.  Think basketball courts galore, a field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground for the little ones, and even a water fountain to keep them cool in the summer. It's a true New York City park, with all kinds of folks coming together.\n\nNow, you won't find any towering office buildings here.  Mostly, you'll see buildings for co-ops or condos, and two-family houses are super common.  The people here? Nice enough, but a bit loud, if you know what I mean. Cars blasting music, revving their engines, it's like a symphony of noise! \n\nIf you're visiting at night, just be a little careful, okay? Bensonhurst is generally safe, but you never know who you might run into.  There's always a chance of running into troublemakers or even petty thieves. I've had a few run-ins myself in the past, nothing too serious, but it's always good to be aware.  Package theft, for example, is a bit of a problem here. \n\nOh, and one last thing that bugs me… people here don't always pick up after their dogs. You'll see it everywhere – dog poop on the sidewalk, near the train station, even in front of the supermarket.  Ugh! It's a real pet peeve of mine.  So, keep your shoes clean, okay?",
            "Hmm...my little corner of the world is kinda unique, you know? It's all about the hills here, steep ones, like the one my house sits on top of. People call it the \"workout hill\" 'cause joggers love to huff and puff their way up it. And get this, there aren't any sidewalks! Everyone walks right on the road, which can be a bit scary 'cause it's got these cracks and bumps.\n\nAnd the power lines? Don't even get me started. They're all tangled up and patchwork-y 'cause the storms here are wild. Branches are always crashing down on 'em. Everywhere you look, there are these tall, green trees, but everyone's always trying to cut 'em down. Can you believe it? They want a clear view of the ocean, so they build these massive houses with huge windows on the second floor, just to stare at the water. \n\nSunset is pretty breathtaking though, the sky turns this fiery orange and the water glows.  But most days are kinda gloomy, all cloudy and damp. Moss grows everywhere - on the roofs, the cars, even the railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and it practically became a mossy green monster! Took me ages to scrub it all off.\n\nThere aren't many kids around here, more like older folks, lots of retirees. Instead of kids, everyone's got dogs! You see 'em everywhere, chilling in yards or chasing each other down the street. Be careful if you leave your doors open, they might sneak right in! I found one napping in my living room once, had to usher him out. \n\nOh, and rabbits! They're everywhere, some of them are real big, and the gardeners hate them 'cause they dig up everything. My cats love them though, they've almost hunted all of them out. We also have the usual birds - sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle swoops by, until the neighborhood crows chase it off. \n\nThere aren't any stores nearby, but there are a few restaurants down by the waterfront, serving up fresh seafood. The beach isn't much, but the rocks are fun to chuck into the water. The bay isn't very wide, you can see the other side even through the mist.",
            "Life in our little corner of Tennessee is pretty much what you'd expect from a sleepy town. We live on a street that connects two big roads, so there's more traffic than I'd like, but it's peaceful otherwise. Most folks around here have been here for a while, so we've all gotten to know each other.  \n\nDays are pretty ordinary - folks are busy tending their yards, running errands, the usual stuff.  When winter hits, the kids bundle up and sled down the hill on our street.  Our house is right at the corner, so we see everyone coming and going, know all the usual cars that pass by.  If we see something different, we take notice.\n\nSome neighbors like to walk for exercise, others stroll with their dogs. Kids zoom around on bikes, doing what kids do. We work from home, so we're around a lot. It's me, my wife, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen.  Everyone's pretty used to seeing us popping in and out.\n\nWe're always out and about, playing in the yard, even if it's drizzling. Sometimes we fire up the grill on the back deck, and the smell of barbecue tingles the air. It seems like there's always someone mowing their lawn - the sound of the mower is a regular soundtrack from spring until fall.\n\nWe've got a lot of trees around here, 'cause this used to be a forest. Lots of shade in the summer, but come fall, it's a leaf-raking marathon!  I even like the smell of burning leaves, a sure sign that autumn has arrived.  We haven't had much of a winter lately, just a long, drawn-out fall.\n\nOur garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's at the door, which isn't often. I like to tinker in the garage with my truck or other projects. When the garage doors are open, it feels like I'm right in the middle of everything.\n\nHolidays are pretty quiet. Thanksgiving brings some extra folks to town, cars are parked everywhere. It's the same story for Mother's Day and Christmas.\n\nAll in all, it's a good place to live.  If it weren't for that through-traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert, where the only color you see for miles is brown. Unless you've actually lived here, you wouldn't understand. I mean, every once in a while you see a lawn that looks like a little green oasis, and you just know that person is spending a fortune to keep it that way. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were spread out like the tumbleweeds, but now it's getting crowded. There are new houses popping up everywhere. Honestly, it feels like a city is slowly creeping in, but I guess that's happening everywhere these days. \n\nMost of the people are super friendly, but like any place, you have your good apples and your bad ones. My neighborhood is surrounded by sweet, old folks, so I guess that makes it a pretty nice place to live.\n\nThe stores around here are mostly the big chain ones like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final.  If you want something fancy, like a Whole Foods, you have to drive quite a bit. \n\nAs for jobs, it seems like construction is king here. I think that's because the city is still growing and there's so much open space to build on. It's kinda scary, actually. I liked it when things were more spread out. I came here to escape the big city, and I don't want to go back. \n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. \n\nWhat I love about living out here is all the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the desert's beauty is definitely a big draw. The harsh climate and landscape have created these incredible ecosystems that need protecting. We share this space with all sorts of critters, so it's important for us humans to learn about them and live alongside them peacefully.\n\nMy family and I have gotten pretty good at coexisting with the desert animals. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside trying to catch some specimens.\n\nThere are a few fun things to do around here, and Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. If you're planning a visit, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast with tons of activities and fun. \n\nTake a short trip to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and maybe even learn some winter sports.\n\nIf you're interested in history and nature, check out the Victor Valley Museum. They have all sorts of cool stuff like fossils, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how Victorville came to be.",
            "Hmm... my heart and soul are tied to this place, this college campus that feels like home.  While others might talk about houses and lawns, my neighborhood is the dormitory halls and the faces of the people I live with.  Sure, the rest of the campus is part of it too, but it's the heart of it all that makes it special.  \n\nYou see,  my \"houses\" are different.  There are the apartments, where a few friends huddle together, maybe 2 to 4 people in a room, each floor with a few more, making a little community within a community.  Then there are the actual houses, like mini-villages scattered around, mostly for the older folks who have finished their studies.  But the real heart of the place is the dorm rooms, rows and rows of them, each holding two sleepy souls, ready to conquer the world together.\n\nAnd the people!  Oh, the people!  It's a melting pot, a kaleidoscope of cultures and ages, all woven together by the threads of learning. The professors, those wise owls, they live in those little houses, while the newer students find comfort in the dorm rooms, and the seasoned veterans settle into the apartments.\n\nIt's hard to describe the energy, the spirit of this place.  It's alive, buzzing with ideas, laughter, and late-night study sessions.  \n\nAnd just like any neighborhood, we've got our own little shops and a park to escape to.  There are places to grab a bite, buy books and supplies, and even a little oasis of green where we can relax and recharge.  It's all here, within these walls, a world unto itself.",
            "Hmm...my heart n soul have been in this neighbourhood for about 10 years. When I first arrived, from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I gotta be real, I was a mess. Tears flowed like a river because I missed everyone back home, but my mama and papa wanted the best for me and my little sis, so we moved for a fresh start, you know? Better place to live, a better high school, a whole vibe change. It took a while to adjust, made some friends, some not-so-friendly faces too, but that's life. I never really got to know the neighbours, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a bit,  since they lived right next door. Those guys, they're like family to me, truly. I'll never forget when we went to Mr. Glen's wedding (he got hitched again!). It was a blast, like a party straight outta a fairytale. Makes me wanna do the same someday, build my fortune, treat my future wife like a queen.  When Ms. Veda, his new missus, took off that little white strap on her leg and tossed it, I snagged it!  Sadly, I missed the bouquet though. We danced till dawn, had a real good time, especially with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, hope things are good for her!\n\n This neighbourhood's a bit like a maze, but now I got my GPS, so I can explore it at my own pace. I haven't ventured too far, only when I hang out with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games non-stop, just living life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd chill at the park, soaking in nature. It calms my soul, brings peace. I even bring sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, sometimes my bokken wooden sword too. It's my thing, you know?\n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court, haven't played in ages, but it's nice to have 'em there just in case. My dad and his best buddy, Mr. Graves, taught me and my best friend how to play tennis. We had a blast, even though they pushed us hard! Good times, man.\n\nThis neighbourhood has been good to me. Filled with memories, plenty of stories to tell, but these are the ones that really stick. And you know what? I think the best is yet to come!",
            "Hmm... my little corner of the world is actually pretty sweet. It's just a hop, skip, and a jump from my college, so that's a major plus. Mostly, it's filled with apartment buildings, but there are a couple of really cool little restaurants and bars that won't break the bank. \n\nOne of the bars just got a makeover and it's a bit fancier now, but the drinks and service are still pretty good. The people there are mostly students like me or folks who are living on a budget, like myself.  It's pretty lively, especially since there's an elementary school nearby, so there are always kids around.\n\nI don't really know my neighbors – I mean, we haven't had a chance to chat – but that's totally fine by me. There's this one group who seem to enjoy a little something-something, and the building management decided to put an air freshener right outside their door. Talk about a laugh!  It's almost like they're trying to cover up the scent of… well, you know. \n\nA lot of the buildings around here are a bit older, but some of them have been spruced up inside. Down the street, there are these brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan. They're built like, well, they're built cheap! But the rent? Sky high! It's just a scam because they're close to campus.\n\nThere is this ridiculously cheap place about five minutes away where they serve everything on paper plates, and most of it comes out of the microwave. Across the street is a gas station, which I've heard is a nightmare to work at. But at least the city put some money into repaving the streets last summer. Now there's a nice sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area is looking a bit more polished. \n\nMy apartment building is pretty much hidden behind a bunch of trees. They chopped down a few, leaving some stumps, but there are way more trees here than down the street. Behind my complex is a line of trees, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, and right behind me is 43rd, which isn't quite as charming. The sidewalks are crumbling, and the buildings look pretty shabby. There are a lot of trees there too, probably to hide the not-so-pretty parts.\n\nMost of the trouble in the area seems to be in that apartment complex on 43rd street, but I can't blame them entirely. There are some places across the street from me with a bit of a revolving door of residents and a fair share of crime. \n\nBut you know what? I actually like it here. It's affordable, there's a ton of stuff close by, and the university and bus stops are just a stone's throw away. It's pretty convenient!",
            "My little corner of the world is like stepping back in time.  These cute duplexes, all painted sunshine yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, are scattered around a quiet cul-de-sac. We're like one big, happy family here, though not everyone's best friends. Every now and then, we gather at the end of a random driveway just to chat while the kids run around, playing with their toys, chalk, or kites.  It's a real breath of fresh air in this crazy, tech-obsessed world.  \n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees,  with big blue skies and fluffy clouds.  It's pretty idyllic, except for the occasional tornado threat.  Last night, the sirens actually went off, and wouldn't you know it, I ended up in the bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and a couple of pillows.  My big guy thought the whole thing was a hoot and stayed glued to the living room, barking nervously.  The whole neighborhood was silent except for the sound of hail pounding on the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road was practically steaming from the sudden temperature change. We went from a scorching 92 degrees to a cool 75 in minutes! The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As the clouds cleared, the sun peeked out, and guess what? A double rainbow arched across the sky!  I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with everyone on Facebook. They were all blown away, just like me.  \n\nThe streets stayed quiet for a while, then slowly, people started trickling back home.  Back to normal life - moms and kids outside, dinner cooking on the stove. It's such a friendly place.  I just moved here from New Hampshire, and I'm loving the southern charm and accents.   \n\nWe all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, but they're not all the same inside. Some are surprisingly tiny!  But I'm lucky enough to have a nice one.\n\nI love taking walks in the huge field behind my place, wandering down to the pond (not for swimming, though).  I've seen deer, and in the mornings, this giant bullfrog serenades us with his calls. It's paradise, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Each day begins with the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It really feels like a little village.  And there's even a friendly donkey at a farm nearby who lets us know he's around with his evening bray.\n\n I feel so blessed to have found this little gem of a neighborhood!",
            "Moving to this neighborhood right before eighth grade felt like stepping into a whole new world. Making friends took some time, but eventually, I found my crew - a guy who lived just two houses down and another fella from down the street. They've both moved on since then, but those memories still linger. The cool thing is, most of the original folks who were here when I first arrived are still around.  It's pretty typical, you know, the kind of place you see in the movies –  lots of two-story houses, kids playing outside every weekend, or whenever the weather's nice. It's usually pretty peaceful, except for the occasional sounds of laughter and shouts from the kids.  \n\nNever had a single problem with anyone here. It's the kind of place where you're left alone unless you actually need something. I've ordered tons of stuff online, never had a package disappear from my porch, which makes me feel like I can trust my neighbors. There's this awesome park just a stone's throw from my house. It's where I spent countless hours playing basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood guys.  I even have this one cringe-worthy memory of getting elbowed in the nose playing football there, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. These days, when I go to the park, it's all about hanging out with my cousin's kids. They're little bundles of energy, still obsessed with swings and slides. Just thinking about it makes them light up. It really brings back a flood of memories, you know?\n\nThis neighborhood is a melting pot, seriously. You name it, there's probably a restaurant serving it within a mile radius. We've got Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – the works!  But nowadays,  most people just order their food through apps like Grubhub or DoorDash. Fast food is always a hit, and you can find that anywhere, but there are also plenty of pizza places, which is always a bonus. The stores here have everything you could ever need. They've got dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is pretty popular around here. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling like making some authentic Indian food or grabbing some ready-made stuff.\n\nHonestly, I'm really happy living here. Reading about all the crazy neighbor stuff on social media and the news makes me appreciate my little slice of peace and quiet even more.",
            "My town, Johnston, is like a little secret hidden away in South Carolina. It ain't flashy or anything, just a quiet place where life moves at a slower pace. But you know what? It's got a special heart, especially when it comes to peaches.  They call it the Peach Capital of the World, and you can see why.  Everywhere you look, it's rows and rows of peach trees stretching as far as the eye can see, or maybe it's just all the cows munching on grass.  \n\nThe houses are spread out, mostly two stories with metal roofs to keep the summer heat at bay, or those gray shingles that look kinda dusty but kinda cool at the same time. They're usually tucked back from the road, leaving space for fields out front – perfect for animals or growing things.\n\nThe main drag is pretty simple: one lone stoplight at a four-way intersection, and that's where you'll find everything: the Hong Kong restaurant, serving up some tasty Chinese food, Fiesta for some Mexican vibes, and Gary's for a good ol' fashioned burger.  There used to be a pizza place, but it closed down, which kinda makes you miss that cheesy goodness.\n\nThen there's the little drugstore, Maxwell and Halford, where they're famous for their Cherry Coke – gotta love a good Cherry Coke. And of course, there's IGA, the grocery store. It's small and a bit pricey, so a lot of folks head over to Batesburg-Leesville to get their main groceries at Walmart. But the real star is Dollar General. It's always buzzing with people grabbing essentials and random things they didn't even know they needed.\n\nThere's also a furniture store called Possibilities, run by this sweet lady who knows everyone. They even have movers to help you get your new couch home! And right next door is a pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where your furry friend can get a spa day.\n\nThe doctor's office and the vet are a little off the beaten path, but they're good folks who take care of everyone. And there's Johnston Elementary School, where kids learn and grow. But once they're done with fifth grade, they gotta head to the next town for middle and high school.\n\nWe don't have any parks, not really. But we're working on a little green space to give families someplace to hang out. It's a small town, you know? Not much to do, no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or fancy hangouts. But it's got a charm to it. Just like a warm hug on a chilly day. You pass through  and it might just surprise you with its heart.",
            "The first time I heard about my apartment building being in the news, it was on a podcast about missing persons.  It was a bit of a shock.  All the apartments in the area were going for over a thousand dollars a month, and I'd never heard a peep about anything like that.  Maybe it's the struggle, you know? I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night.  Things are expensive, but we've learned to be happy with less. You start to appreciate the dusty charm of flea market finds and clothes that have seen better days.  You don't smell as much in adulthood, haha.  You might even pick up a bad habit like smoking, or maybe you just get used to it. But that flea market smell always sticks with you. It's like the smell of adulthood: dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, clinging to the leather of your furniture even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three thrift stores within walking distance here. If you start on the far end, you can hit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and even a curio shop. Downtown is packed, cars and people everywhere, but you wouldn't hear a peep of it inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, it's always silent. It's a great place to lose an afternoon.  Every year, there are more and more people and cars here.  They say it's a developing city. It's becoming a hub for online shopping and delivery, but it still feels a little raw around the edges. It reminds me of New York - everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one really expects anything from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and no one bats an eye. It's not like the South, where showing a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into your business. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city just rolls along, like waves on a beach. It's a lively place to be, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on.\n\nIn a way, we have less of an apartment building filled with strangers and more of a community of friends. We get together for our needs, celebrate each other's birthdays, mourn our losses, and help each other out when we can. I'm lucky to be here, really. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my place tidy, leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them their mail, and they bring mine. It's nice to see their faces and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in this huge, impersonal modern building, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess up my life.",
            "My neighbourhood, well, it's pretty much like all the others, you know?  Like a picture out of a magazine, all cookie cutter houses and manicured lawns.  The homeowner's association is really on top of things, making sure everything looks just so.  \n\nYou drive in and it's the same story everywhere you go: neat little houses, all with matching two-car garages.  The front yards are identical – a patch of grass, some fancy pebbles, and a short driveway.  There are a few trees sprinkled around, just for a touch of nature. The streets are brand new, all paved with smooth concrete.   It's amazing how good they look, even though so many families live here.\n\nThe houses themselves are mostly one story, but you'll see the occasional two-story one, too.  And forget about those cute little mailboxes you see in front of houses in the movies.  We have these big, communal mailboxes at the end of the street, like in an apartment building. Everyone has their own key, and there are even big lockers for packages.  I guess the HOA likes things neat and tidy.  \n\nThe best part is, my house is right on the edge of town, so it feels a bit like the country mixed with suburbia.  We have tons of space, which means community pools everyone can use – they're immaculate and gated.  And there are walking trails everywhere, perfect for strolling with your dog or just enjoying the fresh air.\n\nMost of my neighbours are retired folks,  It's a really safe and friendly place, everyone looks out for each other.  But there are also some younger families and middle-aged professionals mixing things up.   \n\nThe city itself is surprisingly large, even though it still has that small-town feel. We have everything you need – a single mall (not huge, but it gets the job done), grocery stores, even those bargain outlets with the bare minimum staff.\n\nAll in all, my neighbourhood is pretty typical, safe, well-kept, and comfortable.  We've got all the basics, nice amenities, and if we need something else, we can hop in the car and be there in 15 minutes.",
            "My life is here, in this little town nestled just outside a bustling city. It's a place where folks know each other, where smiles are exchanged on the street, and where life moves at a gentler pace.  My neighborhood, on the east side, isn't the fanciest. Houses are modest, mostly rented by folks who work hard but don't have much.  But it's got a heart, my neighborhood. Folks here are kind, always ready to lend a hand.  \n\nTruth be told, there have been tough times.  Like the day our neighbors lost their son, a senseless act of violence outside a bar. It shook us all. It reminds us that life can be fragile, even in a place that feels safe.  We've had a few things stolen from our porch, a reminder that trouble can find you anywhere.  This whole opioid thing, it's hit us hard, like it has so many places.  But there's strength here too.  Folks are fighting back, with support groups and addiction centers, and even Narcan training for families.\n\nThe school my son goes to, though, that's a shining light.  Teachers and staff, they care so much. My son thrives there, even with his special needs. No bullying, just kindness and acceptance.  The PTO is awesome, always putting on events to bring families together.  They even provide free breakfast and lunch for every kid, because no child should ever go hungry.\n\nIt's not perfect, though.  The town seems to have more luck with improvements on the west side, where the shops and traffic are.  The east side, where we live, we feel a little forgotten.\n\nStill, I wouldn't trade this town for anything.  It's home. It's where our roots are. 16 years we've been here, and this place has become a part of us.",
            "Hmm... my heart n soul belong to this neighborhood, this Hilltop. It's like a tapestry woven with history. Imagine, I live in a seven-story building right across from an old theater, a witness to countless stories.  Just a stone's throw away, there's this cool little bar, an arcade filled with laughter and chatter, drawing folks in on warm summer nights. Especially in June and July, you'll see a line snaking down the street, just waiting to step inside. Not too far from there, tucked away, is a city park, a green oasis in the heart of it all. Concrete borders the park, with these tall stairs built right into the wall.  Come winter, when the rain comes down like sheets, you'll see folks who are down on their luck setting up their tents, huddled together for warmth. They're trying to make it, you know, right here, in the city center, close to the only family center around. It's about survival, finding a bit of shelter and a place to feel something close to home.\n\nBut what truly makes this place captivating, it's not the grand old buildings or the way the hills roll towards the ocean. It's the people, their spirit. You see, Hilltop, it wasn't always this way. Back in the day, it was a place where the streets were ruled by gangs. Stories still whisper about those times, about the cops and the DEA trying to clean up the mess. But the people here, they remember. These stories are passed down, generation to generation, to newcomers like me. They work hard, even though folks still whisper about it being a tough neighborhood. They care about their community, their streets.  Some folks say you shouldn't walk around here after dark if you're white. I think that's just the echoes of the past, a lingering fear that shouldn't hold sway anymore. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the weight of those stories, the reminders of racism and the assumptions that divide us.  \n\nBut one thing's for sure, no matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. It's alive, these streets. At night, I feel a sense of belonging, a connection with people who are quick to offer a jacket before a threat. It's a place where the laundromat owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone when the rain was pouring. A place where, on a cold night, a stranger stopped, looked into my eyes, handed me a five-dollar bill, and told me I was beautiful and valuable. That's the Hilltop I know, a place of grit, resilience, and unexpected kindness.",
            "My life's a postcard from Rural America, you know, the kind with fields as far as the eye can see and little towns dotted along the way.  We're talking Michigan, where the closest Walmart is a drive away, and forget about finding an Applebee's. You gotta hop in the car for just about everything. But hey, I wouldn't trade it for the world.  We're surrounded by water here. Lake Michigan on one side, Lake Charlevoix on the other – beaches practically everywhere you turn.  My neighborhood? It's the picture of small-town charm. Houses aren't crammed together like sardines in a can. They're older, each with its own story to tell. Some folks have updated their places, others have kept things classic. You'll spot a basement or two peeking out from under the houses – big ones, too!  And the colors! We've got every shade imaginable, all lined up like a rainbow. Most yards are spacious, with trampolines bouncing, playsets squeaking, and gardens bursting with blooms.  You see families, folks working hard to make ends meet, raising their kids or watching their grandkids grow. Kids are out playing, dogs are getting their walks, people are biking, rollerblading, just enjoying life. It's a tight-knit community, you know, where everyone looks out for each other.  You'll see someone grilling up a feast and they'll wave, or maybe someone walking their dog from a few blocks over and give you a friendly smile. Lawns are kept neat and tidy, no piles of leaves or overgrown bushes here. It's not about fancy homes, it's about a place where you can feel comfortable, safe, and like you belong. \n\nWe have the sheriff's department, the jail, the health department – all within walking distance.  The recycling center is just down the road, and folks from all over town use it.  There are baseball and softball fields where you can hear the cheers of the crowd and the announcer calling out the scores.  And our little airport?  You can hear those planes taking off and landing, even from inside your house.  Need some ice cream? Just a short walk will get you there! And if you're feeling adventurous, you can even bike downtown! My kids can ride their bikes to the park, just a few blocks away. Yeah, it's pretty darn great here."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Hmm...my heart goes thump-thump every time I think about my neighborhood. It's like a giant melting pot, you know? Houses and shops are all mixed up, like someone threw them in a blender and hit 'shuffle.' There are these big, fancy stores everyone knows, but also these little shops that are popping up everywhere. You can walk down the street and suddenly find yourself staring at a cute boutique, like a little secret hidden in plain sight. And speaking of secrets, there are parks tucked away in the middle of it all, where families go to play. It's like a little oasis in the city jungle.\n\nNow, the people in my neighborhood, oh my gosh, they're a story in themselves! You've got your LGBTQ+ folks, your Orthodox Jews, even folks who came from faraway places like the old Soviet Union. It's like a microcosm of the whole world, right here in my backyard. And if you go a little further out, you'll find even more communities, like Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia...it's like a journey around the world without ever leaving the city!\n\nThe only problem is, getting around can be a nightmare. Traffic is insane, and finding a parking spot is like winning the lottery. People here practically live in their cars. They don't walk anywhere, even if it's just a few blocks away. It's sad, really. It's like we've forgotten how to enjoy the simple things, like a stroll down the street.\n\nBut hey, at least there's always something new being built. They're putting up these giant apartment buildings everywhere, which means more people, more cars, more chaos. But hey, someone's gotta live in them, right?\n\nSpeaking of living, there are all sorts of places to call home here. You've got your big apartments, your cozy houses, even those tiny little condos that look like dollhouses. It's a bit of a mix, and I guess that's what makes it interesting.\n\nAnd the people? Well, you know, there's a whole lot of us, but we're not exactly close-knit. Back when I was a kid, we used to play outside all the time, but now everyone's got their heads down, staring at their phones. It's a shame, really.",
            "My neighborhood, its a little slice of Americana, you know? Most of the houses are like those classic single-family homes, but some folks have split their place into two, still attached though, kinda like a friendly twin thing. My house has a small patch of grass out front and a tiny driveway on the side. It's like a time capsule, reminding you of that whole \"American Dream\" thing, back when it felt like everyone was reaching for it. Now, it's like the dream's kind of drifting away from some folks, but not us. We're still holding on, clinging to it as tight as we can.\n\nYou can tell the folks here aren't as starry-eyed as they used to be. The little yards aren't as manicured, but there's still a car or two in every driveway. The kids are out playing, like the whole world's their playground. The old public school, practically a hundred years old, still stands tall, giving the young ones hope for the future while reminding the older folks of simpler times.  \n\nThere aren't many churches around, most are empty these days, but the basketball courts are always buzzing.  Every house looks different, but they all have that familiar feel, like they're part of the same family. There's a big supermarket called \"Super A,\" run by a big Yemenite family, probably the only ones around here.  Most folks here are African American, been here for generations,  knowing everyone like family.  \n\nThey can tell you stories about a time when everyone knew everyone, back when there was a karate school, but it closed down when the karate movies went out of style.  Now it's a pharmacy, because, well, drugs fix everything, right? There's a little movie theater too, playing old flicks for a song. The kids wouldn't be caught dead there, but the older folks love it, a cheap night out without the kids, you know?\n\nWe've got one main road that cuts through, an expressway, but the on and off ramps are in the next town over. We tried to get an exit for our town, the kids were all for it, but the older folks said it would ruin everything.  They got their way, convinced the city council to say no. They're building a new high school, and we're trying to pick a mascot.  I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect fit for our town.",
            "You might just overlook it, tucked away behind a shopping strip, in a residential area that doesn't scream \"lively neighborhood.\"  It's not the kind of place you'd imagine bustling with life, at least not the kind of life most folks picture. But if you dare to venture behind the old, forgotten Whole Foods and peek past those hotels that only stir to life for occasional family reunions, you'll stumble upon a hidden world teeming with activity.  There, nestled among these streets, are a handful of apartment complexes, stacked together like Russian nesting dolls, carefully disassembled and arranged in a neat line.\n\nNow, the first apartments you encounter might have earned some unwanted notoriety, so let's not dwell on those. Appearances can be deceiving, you know. But the ones next door, and the two after that, they're a whole different story, a secret world known only to a select few.  Just across the street from these complexes, you'll find a sleepy little branch of a community college. It's a quiet bunch, with students shuffling in with their coffee, yawning at the crack of dawn, ready to face another day.  The iron gates creak open, one by one, as they make their way inside. Meanwhile, commuters honk their horns and grumble about the traffic delays on busy mornings.\n\nThe road splits, leading to another residential street. On one side, a park bustles with life. On the other, a rehabilitation center, a place of healing, stands quietly.  Porch furniture adorns the front, and a ceiling fan lazily spins, creating a gentle breeze in the thick summer air. Children race across the green, their laughter echoing through the park, while bees dance among the colorful flowers lining the roadside.  Elderly folks stroll along the walking path, casting disapproving glances at the teenagers on skateboards and offering polite nods to the teenage girls huddled around the playground, their whispers filled with gossip about boys and the latest viral videos.\n\nNext to the park, a strip mall offers a glimpse of everyday life: a sushi place with affordable eats, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon tucked in between.  Imagine: you could fill your pool for the summer, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken all in one stop. The magic of a good strip mall! There's even a DIY frozen yogurt place, where teenagers, armed with cold, dripping cups piled high with toppings, perform tricks on their skateboards and puff on vapes, convinced they're the coolest kids around.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a slice of classic Americana, a piece of history preserved in the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "\"Where in the world is everything?\" she asked, her voice laced with surprise as we passed the endless rows of corn stretching out before us like an ocean. I chuckled, knowing she wouldn't quite grasp the vastness of it all.  She came from a town where the grocery store was just a hop, skip, and a jump away. Open spaces like this were simply unheard of.  So, I started telling her about my childhood in rural Ohio, about growing up surrounded by fields and fields of corn. As I spoke, I saw a glimmer of understanding in her eyes.  Finally, she was getting a glimpse into who I was, where I came from.\n\nWe continued down the two-lane highway, past a shimmering quarry now filled with water. Just beyond it, nestled amongst the cornfields, lay my little development. It was a quiet place, with brick and stucco houses, each one boasting at least half an acre of land that folks took pride in keeping immaculate. Come springtime, the yards burst with color, blooming with flowers and adorned with trees that painted themselves in a new hue with each passing season.  And everywhere you looked, gleaming Mercedes Benz cars, their paint sparkling in the midday sun after a good old-fashioned car wash.\n\nAs we neared my house, I spotted my Korean neighbor, always outside with a wave and a friendly smile.  He spent his days tending to his lawn, the hum of his mower accompanied by his cheerful singing.  Everyone got a good laugh out of it, but he was a genuinely kind soul with a fascinating past. He'd been a doctor, you see, but now his days were spent blending in with the grass, his John Deere Zero Turn mower his chariot. \n\nFinally, we pulled up to my grey stucco house. In the side yard, a gaggle of geese honked and herded around our terrier, while our backyard boasted a small stream that flowed into the quarry. The sounds of bullfrogs, the gentle gurgling of the water, and the occasional \"moo\" from a nearby farm filled the air. Across a handmade wooden bridge was a secret oasis, untouched and wild, filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood playground, the place where I built tree forts, \"hunted\" animals (mostly chasing them), and spent countless hours with neighborhood friends.\n\nWinters here were something else entirely. The green would fade, leaving a stark, empty landscape. The trees, once bursting with vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers, stood bare, their branches reaching towards the sky like skeletal fingers. But when snow fell, it transformed everything into a winter wonderland. Snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen dotted the backyard. We fought like cats and dogs as kids, and during winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We built massive igloo-like forts, our arsenals stocked with branches. In our own little world, we played pretend, lost in a time where nothing else mattered. We were just kids, carefree and happy.",
            "Hmm...Portland, Oregon, it's got a vibe, you know? Like, they've got this thing, this slogan, plastered on a building that's kinda like, a pizza place, a bar, a music spot, maybe even a little bit naughty, you get me? It says, \"Keep Portland Weird.\"  Some folks, they see it as a throwback, like remembering the old Portland, back when it was quieter, less crowded, and more of a secret. Where all these cool, unique groups popped up. But for others, it's like, a welcome mat, a whisper saying, \"Come on in, be weird here, we'll love you for it.\" And even with all the fancy Californians moving in and building shiny new towers, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.\n\nIt's not that everyone's always accepting, mind you. But it's about accepting the things that don't fit in, the things that make you go, \"Hmm, that's interesting.\"  It's like, we're not rejecting the modern stuff, we have our iPhones and online shopping just like everyone else. But somehow, we're just a little more...unconventional.  We've got yoga studios, hipsters, and suits in the same neighborhood. Maybe it's just that we don't take things too seriously here.\n\nIn my neighborhood, anyway, you see these crazy colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers and veggies lining the streets. And in the summer, there are these free boxes, see? Cardboard boxes, sometimes plastic bags, filled with random treasures. Clothes, books, who knows what else! It's like a scavenger hunt, a little surprise waiting for you around every corner. That's what Portland's all about, at least to me.  We're a bunch of different kinds of weird, all living together. Some folks find free boxes a little too much, they'd rather be at goat yoga or cheering on the Timbers. \n\nBut hey, Portland's got something for everyone. People chasing dreams, people dreaming about dreams, people who love soccer, people who love goats, people who love...well, you get the picture. We've got our problems, sure. Drugs, homelessness, the usual stuff. But we're working on it, trying to figure it out, just like everyone else.  It's not always pretty, but it's real. And that's what makes Portland, well, Portland.",
            "The mountains, they are always there.  Up north, watching the sun rise and set every single day.  No matter how busy life gets, how much I forget about them, they're still there.  Solid, strong, not bothered by all the chaos going on down here. Then, when I'm stressed out, feeling all tangled up inside, they seem to call out to me. And when I look at them, they quiet my worries, giving me a little strength to keep going, one step at a time. I first came here when I started college. Those mountains north of campus, they were the first thing that really caught my eye. Sure, the university itself is pretty amazing, with its buildings and ponds and trees, each with its own special place in my heart. But the mountains, they take the prize. The town itself is lovely, don't get me wrong. There are tons of cafes where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and study sessions.  A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where old, faded brick buildings line the streets of restaurants and shops. It's like stepping back in time, with all the energy and buzz of a big city.  But just a few blocks away, you're back in the peaceful, quiet town, just past the library. This mix of vibes, so close together, makes this place feel magical, like it's waiting to be discovered. It's easy to make memories here, good and bad.  Like walking past the old swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or rushing through the busy downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater, tickets courtesy of the university. But it's also where some tough memories live. The ponds, especially, are great for both reflecting and crying at 2 am when you're having an existential crisis (which, trust me, I've had a few). Watching turtles and ducks and bugs go about their lives, each with a purpose, makes you wonder about your own place in the world. So, I'd walk past the pond, past the park, past the little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I reached the main street. And there it was, the sunrise, painting the sky with its brilliant colours as the sun shone on the palm trees.  I was walking north. Of course, I was.  There they were, the mountains, just as they'd always been.  They towered over everything else, touching the hazy blue and yellow sky.  And without saying a word, they reminded me to keep going, to be strong.",
            "Hmm...Visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Finding it won't be a problem, trust me! The subway, it runs like a charm, just like everywhere else in New York City. You'll know you're still in the Big Apple, that's for sure. Now, get ready for a feast for the eyes, because you'll see Asian stores practically on every corner.  \n\nOver the last few decades, Bensonhurst has become a real melting pot, especially with all these awesome folks from Asia moving in.  Everywhere you look, it seems like an Asian-owned store, from supermarkets to laundromats, popping up like magic.  And let me tell you, locals absolutely love them!  The food is top-notch, the prices are sweeter than honey, and let's not forget, oh-so-convenient! I swear, there are four Asian supermarkets within a stone's throw from my place! Imagine that!\n\nBut hey, don't think Bensonhurst is just about Asian folks, okay? It's a real mix of everyone, from recent arrivals to those who've been here for generations.  You've got your big Asian-owned businesses, sure, but there's also this brand new park nearby that's a real gem.  Think basketball courts galore, a field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground for the little ones, and even a water fountain to keep them cool in the summer. It's a true New York City park, with all kinds of folks coming together.\n\nNow, you won't find any towering office buildings here.  Mostly, you'll see buildings for co-ops or condos, and two-family houses are super common.  The people here? Nice enough, but a bit loud, if you know what I mean. Cars blasting music, revving their engines, it's like a symphony of noise! \n\nIf you're visiting at night, just be a little careful, okay? Bensonhurst is generally safe, but you never know who you might run into.  There's always a chance of running into troublemakers or even petty thieves. I've had a few run-ins myself in the past, nothing too serious, but it's always good to be aware.  Package theft, for example, is a bit of a problem here. \n\nOh, and one last thing that bugs me… people here don't always pick up after their dogs. You'll see it everywhere – dog poop on the sidewalk, near the train station, even in front of the supermarket.  Ugh! It's a real pet peeve of mine.  So, keep your shoes clean, okay?",
            "Hmm...my little corner of the world is kinda unique, you know? It's all about the hills here, steep ones, like the one my house sits on top of. People call it the \"workout hill\" 'cause joggers love to huff and puff their way up it. And get this, there aren't any sidewalks! Everyone walks right on the road, which can be a bit scary 'cause it's got these cracks and bumps.\n\nAnd the power lines? Don't even get me started. They're all tangled up and patchwork-y 'cause the storms here are wild. Branches are always crashing down on 'em. Everywhere you look, there are these tall, green trees, but everyone's always trying to cut 'em down. Can you believe it? They want a clear view of the ocean, so they build these massive houses with huge windows on the second floor, just to stare at the water. \n\nSunset is pretty breathtaking though, the sky turns this fiery orange and the water glows.  But most days are kinda gloomy, all cloudy and damp. Moss grows everywhere - on the roofs, the cars, even the railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and it practically became a mossy green monster! Took me ages to scrub it all off.\n\nThere aren't many kids around here, more like older folks, lots of retirees. Instead of kids, everyone's got dogs! You see 'em everywhere, chilling in yards or chasing each other down the street. Be careful if you leave your doors open, they might sneak right in! I found one napping in my living room once, had to usher him out. \n\nOh, and rabbits! They're everywhere, some of them are real big, and the gardeners hate them 'cause they dig up everything. My cats love them though, they've almost hunted all of them out. We also have the usual birds - sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle swoops by, until the neighborhood crows chase it off. \n\nThere aren't any stores nearby, but there are a few restaurants down by the waterfront, serving up fresh seafood. The beach isn't much, but the rocks are fun to chuck into the water. The bay isn't very wide, you can see the other side even through the mist.",
            "Life in our little corner of Tennessee is pretty much what you'd expect from a sleepy town. We live on a street that connects two big roads, so there's more traffic than I'd like, but it's peaceful otherwise. Most folks around here have been here for a while, so we've all gotten to know each other.  \n\nDays are pretty ordinary - folks are busy tending their yards, running errands, the usual stuff.  When winter hits, the kids bundle up and sled down the hill on our street.  Our house is right at the corner, so we see everyone coming and going, know all the usual cars that pass by.  If we see something different, we take notice.\n\nSome neighbors like to walk for exercise, others stroll with their dogs. Kids zoom around on bikes, doing what kids do. We work from home, so we're around a lot. It's me, my wife, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen.  Everyone's pretty used to seeing us popping in and out.\n\nWe're always out and about, playing in the yard, even if it's drizzling. Sometimes we fire up the grill on the back deck, and the smell of barbecue tingles the air. It seems like there's always someone mowing their lawn - the sound of the mower is a regular soundtrack from spring until fall.\n\nWe've got a lot of trees around here, 'cause this used to be a forest. Lots of shade in the summer, but come fall, it's a leaf-raking marathon!  I even like the smell of burning leaves, a sure sign that autumn has arrived.  We haven't had much of a winter lately, just a long, drawn-out fall.\n\nOur garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's at the door, which isn't often. I like to tinker in the garage with my truck or other projects. When the garage doors are open, it feels like I'm right in the middle of everything.\n\nHolidays are pretty quiet. Thanksgiving brings some extra folks to town, cars are parked everywhere. It's the same story for Mother's Day and Christmas.\n\nAll in all, it's a good place to live.  If it weren't for that through-traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert, where the only color you see for miles is brown. Unless you've actually lived here, you wouldn't understand. I mean, every once in a while you see a lawn that looks like a little green oasis, and you just know that person is spending a fortune to keep it that way. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were spread out like the tumbleweeds, but now it's getting crowded. There are new houses popping up everywhere. Honestly, it feels like a city is slowly creeping in, but I guess that's happening everywhere these days. \n\nMost of the people are super friendly, but like any place, you have your good apples and your bad ones. My neighborhood is surrounded by sweet, old folks, so I guess that makes it a pretty nice place to live.\n\nThe stores around here are mostly the big chain ones like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final.  If you want something fancy, like a Whole Foods, you have to drive quite a bit. \n\nAs for jobs, it seems like construction is king here. I think that's because the city is still growing and there's so much open space to build on. It's kinda scary, actually. I liked it when things were more spread out. I came here to escape the big city, and I don't want to go back. \n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. \n\nWhat I love about living out here is all the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the desert's beauty is definitely a big draw. The harsh climate and landscape have created these incredible ecosystems that need protecting. We share this space with all sorts of critters, so it's important for us humans to learn about them and live alongside them peacefully.\n\nMy family and I have gotten pretty good at coexisting with the desert animals. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside trying to catch some specimens.\n\nThere are a few fun things to do around here, and Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. If you're planning a visit, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast with tons of activities and fun. \n\nTake a short trip to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and maybe even learn some winter sports.\n\nIf you're interested in history and nature, check out the Victor Valley Museum. They have all sorts of cool stuff like fossils, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how Victorville came to be.",
            "Hmm... my heart and soul are tied to this place, this college campus that feels like home.  While others might talk about houses and lawns, my neighborhood is the dormitory halls and the faces of the people I live with.  Sure, the rest of the campus is part of it too, but it's the heart of it all that makes it special.  \n\nYou see,  my \"houses\" are different.  There are the apartments, where a few friends huddle together, maybe 2 to 4 people in a room, each floor with a few more, making a little community within a community.  Then there are the actual houses, like mini-villages scattered around, mostly for the older folks who have finished their studies.  But the real heart of the place is the dorm rooms, rows and rows of them, each holding two sleepy souls, ready to conquer the world together.\n\nAnd the people!  Oh, the people!  It's a melting pot, a kaleidoscope of cultures and ages, all woven together by the threads of learning. The professors, those wise owls, they live in those little houses, while the newer students find comfort in the dorm rooms, and the seasoned veterans settle into the apartments.\n\nIt's hard to describe the energy, the spirit of this place.  It's alive, buzzing with ideas, laughter, and late-night study sessions.  \n\nAnd just like any neighborhood, we've got our own little shops and a park to escape to.  There are places to grab a bite, buy books and supplies, and even a little oasis of green where we can relax and recharge.  It's all here, within these walls, a world unto itself.",
            "Hmm...my heart n soul have been in this neighbourhood for about 10 years. When I first arrived, from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I gotta be real, I was a mess. Tears flowed like a river because I missed everyone back home, but my mama and papa wanted the best for me and my little sis, so we moved for a fresh start, you know? Better place to live, a better high school, a whole vibe change. It took a while to adjust, made some friends, some not-so-friendly faces too, but that's life. I never really got to know the neighbours, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a bit,  since they lived right next door. Those guys, they're like family to me, truly. I'll never forget when we went to Mr. Glen's wedding (he got hitched again!). It was a blast, like a party straight outta a fairytale. Makes me wanna do the same someday, build my fortune, treat my future wife like a queen.  When Ms. Veda, his new missus, took off that little white strap on her leg and tossed it, I snagged it!  Sadly, I missed the bouquet though. We danced till dawn, had a real good time, especially with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, hope things are good for her!\n\n This neighbourhood's a bit like a maze, but now I got my GPS, so I can explore it at my own pace. I haven't ventured too far, only when I hang out with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games non-stop, just living life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd chill at the park, soaking in nature. It calms my soul, brings peace. I even bring sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, sometimes my bokken wooden sword too. It's my thing, you know?\n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court, haven't played in ages, but it's nice to have 'em there just in case. My dad and his best buddy, Mr. Graves, taught me and my best friend how to play tennis. We had a blast, even though they pushed us hard! Good times, man.\n\nThis neighbourhood has been good to me. Filled with memories, plenty of stories to tell, but these are the ones that really stick. And you know what? I think the best is yet to come!",
            "Hmm... my little corner of the world is actually pretty sweet. It's just a hop, skip, and a jump from my college, so that's a major plus. Mostly, it's filled with apartment buildings, but there are a couple of really cool little restaurants and bars that won't break the bank. \n\nOne of the bars just got a makeover and it's a bit fancier now, but the drinks and service are still pretty good. The people there are mostly students like me or folks who are living on a budget, like myself.  It's pretty lively, especially since there's an elementary school nearby, so there are always kids around.\n\nI don't really know my neighbors – I mean, we haven't had a chance to chat – but that's totally fine by me. There's this one group who seem to enjoy a little something-something, and the building management decided to put an air freshener right outside their door. Talk about a laugh!  It's almost like they're trying to cover up the scent of… well, you know. \n\nA lot of the buildings around here are a bit older, but some of them have been spruced up inside. Down the street, there are these brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan. They're built like, well, they're built cheap! But the rent? Sky high! It's just a scam because they're close to campus.\n\nThere is this ridiculously cheap place about five minutes away where they serve everything on paper plates, and most of it comes out of the microwave. Across the street is a gas station, which I've heard is a nightmare to work at. But at least the city put some money into repaving the streets last summer. Now there's a nice sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area is looking a bit more polished. \n\nMy apartment building is pretty much hidden behind a bunch of trees. They chopped down a few, leaving some stumps, but there are way more trees here than down the street. Behind my complex is a line of trees, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, and right behind me is 43rd, which isn't quite as charming. The sidewalks are crumbling, and the buildings look pretty shabby. There are a lot of trees there too, probably to hide the not-so-pretty parts.\n\nMost of the trouble in the area seems to be in that apartment complex on 43rd street, but I can't blame them entirely. There are some places across the street from me with a bit of a revolving door of residents and a fair share of crime. \n\nBut you know what? I actually like it here. It's affordable, there's a ton of stuff close by, and the university and bus stops are just a stone's throw away. It's pretty convenient!",
            "My little corner of the world is like stepping back in time.  These cute duplexes, all painted sunshine yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, are scattered around a quiet cul-de-sac. We're like one big, happy family here, though not everyone's best friends. Every now and then, we gather at the end of a random driveway just to chat while the kids run around, playing with their toys, chalk, or kites.  It's a real breath of fresh air in this crazy, tech-obsessed world.  \n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees,  with big blue skies and fluffy clouds.  It's pretty idyllic, except for the occasional tornado threat.  Last night, the sirens actually went off, and wouldn't you know it, I ended up in the bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and a couple of pillows.  My big guy thought the whole thing was a hoot and stayed glued to the living room, barking nervously.  The whole neighborhood was silent except for the sound of hail pounding on the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road was practically steaming from the sudden temperature change. We went from a scorching 92 degrees to a cool 75 in minutes! The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As the clouds cleared, the sun peeked out, and guess what? A double rainbow arched across the sky!  I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with everyone on Facebook. They were all blown away, just like me.  \n\nThe streets stayed quiet for a while, then slowly, people started trickling back home.  Back to normal life - moms and kids outside, dinner cooking on the stove. It's such a friendly place.  I just moved here from New Hampshire, and I'm loving the southern charm and accents.   \n\nWe all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, but they're not all the same inside. Some are surprisingly tiny!  But I'm lucky enough to have a nice one.\n\nI love taking walks in the huge field behind my place, wandering down to the pond (not for swimming, though).  I've seen deer, and in the mornings, this giant bullfrog serenades us with his calls. It's paradise, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Each day begins with the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It really feels like a little village.  And there's even a friendly donkey at a farm nearby who lets us know he's around with his evening bray.\n\n I feel so blessed to have found this little gem of a neighborhood!",
            "Moving to this neighborhood right before eighth grade felt like stepping into a whole new world. Making friends took some time, but eventually, I found my crew - a guy who lived just two houses down and another fella from down the street. They've both moved on since then, but those memories still linger. The cool thing is, most of the original folks who were here when I first arrived are still around.  It's pretty typical, you know, the kind of place you see in the movies –  lots of two-story houses, kids playing outside every weekend, or whenever the weather's nice. It's usually pretty peaceful, except for the occasional sounds of laughter and shouts from the kids.  \n\nNever had a single problem with anyone here. It's the kind of place where you're left alone unless you actually need something. I've ordered tons of stuff online, never had a package disappear from my porch, which makes me feel like I can trust my neighbors. There's this awesome park just a stone's throw from my house. It's where I spent countless hours playing basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood guys.  I even have this one cringe-worthy memory of getting elbowed in the nose playing football there, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. These days, when I go to the park, it's all about hanging out with my cousin's kids. They're little bundles of energy, still obsessed with swings and slides. Just thinking about it makes them light up. It really brings back a flood of memories, you know?\n\nThis neighborhood is a melting pot, seriously. You name it, there's probably a restaurant serving it within a mile radius. We've got Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – the works!  But nowadays,  most people just order their food through apps like Grubhub or DoorDash. Fast food is always a hit, and you can find that anywhere, but there are also plenty of pizza places, which is always a bonus. The stores here have everything you could ever need. They've got dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is pretty popular around here. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling like making some authentic Indian food or grabbing some ready-made stuff.\n\nHonestly, I'm really happy living here. Reading about all the crazy neighbor stuff on social media and the news makes me appreciate my little slice of peace and quiet even more.",
            "My town, Johnston, is like a little secret hidden away in South Carolina. It ain't flashy or anything, just a quiet place where life moves at a slower pace. But you know what? It's got a special heart, especially when it comes to peaches.  They call it the Peach Capital of the World, and you can see why.  Everywhere you look, it's rows and rows of peach trees stretching as far as the eye can see, or maybe it's just all the cows munching on grass.  \n\nThe houses are spread out, mostly two stories with metal roofs to keep the summer heat at bay, or those gray shingles that look kinda dusty but kinda cool at the same time. They're usually tucked back from the road, leaving space for fields out front – perfect for animals or growing things.\n\nThe main drag is pretty simple: one lone stoplight at a four-way intersection, and that's where you'll find everything: the Hong Kong restaurant, serving up some tasty Chinese food, Fiesta for some Mexican vibes, and Gary's for a good ol' fashioned burger.  There used to be a pizza place, but it closed down, which kinda makes you miss that cheesy goodness.\n\nThen there's the little drugstore, Maxwell and Halford, where they're famous for their Cherry Coke – gotta love a good Cherry Coke. And of course, there's IGA, the grocery store. It's small and a bit pricey, so a lot of folks head over to Batesburg-Leesville to get their main groceries at Walmart. But the real star is Dollar General. It's always buzzing with people grabbing essentials and random things they didn't even know they needed.\n\nThere's also a furniture store called Possibilities, run by this sweet lady who knows everyone. They even have movers to help you get your new couch home! And right next door is a pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where your furry friend can get a spa day.\n\nThe doctor's office and the vet are a little off the beaten path, but they're good folks who take care of everyone. And there's Johnston Elementary School, where kids learn and grow. But once they're done with fifth grade, they gotta head to the next town for middle and high school.\n\nWe don't have any parks, not really. But we're working on a little green space to give families someplace to hang out. It's a small town, you know? Not much to do, no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or fancy hangouts. But it's got a charm to it. Just like a warm hug on a chilly day. You pass through  and it might just surprise you with its heart.",
            "The first time I heard about my apartment building being in the news, it was on a podcast about missing persons.  It was a bit of a shock.  All the apartments in the area were going for over a thousand dollars a month, and I'd never heard a peep about anything like that.  Maybe it's the struggle, you know? I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night.  Things are expensive, but we've learned to be happy with less. You start to appreciate the dusty charm of flea market finds and clothes that have seen better days.  You don't smell as much in adulthood, haha.  You might even pick up a bad habit like smoking, or maybe you just get used to it. But that flea market smell always sticks with you. It's like the smell of adulthood: dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, clinging to the leather of your furniture even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three thrift stores within walking distance here. If you start on the far end, you can hit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and even a curio shop. Downtown is packed, cars and people everywhere, but you wouldn't hear a peep of it inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, it's always silent. It's a great place to lose an afternoon.  Every year, there are more and more people and cars here.  They say it's a developing city. It's becoming a hub for online shopping and delivery, but it still feels a little raw around the edges. It reminds me of New York - everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one really expects anything from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and no one bats an eye. It's not like the South, where showing a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into your business. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city just rolls along, like waves on a beach. It's a lively place to be, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on.\n\nIn a way, we have less of an apartment building filled with strangers and more of a community of friends. We get together for our needs, celebrate each other's birthdays, mourn our losses, and help each other out when we can. I'm lucky to be here, really. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my place tidy, leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them their mail, and they bring mine. It's nice to see their faces and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in this huge, impersonal modern building, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess up my life.",
            "My neighbourhood, well, it's pretty much like all the others, you know?  Like a picture out of a magazine, all cookie cutter houses and manicured lawns.  The homeowner's association is really on top of things, making sure everything looks just so.  \n\nYou drive in and it's the same story everywhere you go: neat little houses, all with matching two-car garages.  The front yards are identical – a patch of grass, some fancy pebbles, and a short driveway.  There are a few trees sprinkled around, just for a touch of nature. The streets are brand new, all paved with smooth concrete.   It's amazing how good they look, even though so many families live here.\n\nThe houses themselves are mostly one story, but you'll see the occasional two-story one, too.  And forget about those cute little mailboxes you see in front of houses in the movies.  We have these big, communal mailboxes at the end of the street, like in an apartment building. Everyone has their own key, and there are even big lockers for packages.  I guess the HOA likes things neat and tidy.  \n\nThe best part is, my house is right on the edge of town, so it feels a bit like the country mixed with suburbia.  We have tons of space, which means community pools everyone can use – they're immaculate and gated.  And there are walking trails everywhere, perfect for strolling with your dog or just enjoying the fresh air.\n\nMost of my neighbours are retired folks,  It's a really safe and friendly place, everyone looks out for each other.  But there are also some younger families and middle-aged professionals mixing things up.   \n\nThe city itself is surprisingly large, even though it still has that small-town feel. We have everything you need – a single mall (not huge, but it gets the job done), grocery stores, even those bargain outlets with the bare minimum staff.\n\nAll in all, my neighbourhood is pretty typical, safe, well-kept, and comfortable.  We've got all the basics, nice amenities, and if we need something else, we can hop in the car and be there in 15 minutes.",
            "My life is here, in this little town nestled just outside a bustling city. It's a place where folks know each other, where smiles are exchanged on the street, and where life moves at a gentler pace.  My neighborhood, on the east side, isn't the fanciest. Houses are modest, mostly rented by folks who work hard but don't have much.  But it's got a heart, my neighborhood. Folks here are kind, always ready to lend a hand.  \n\nTruth be told, there have been tough times.  Like the day our neighbors lost their son, a senseless act of violence outside a bar. It shook us all. It reminds us that life can be fragile, even in a place that feels safe.  We've had a few things stolen from our porch, a reminder that trouble can find you anywhere.  This whole opioid thing, it's hit us hard, like it has so many places.  But there's strength here too.  Folks are fighting back, with support groups and addiction centers, and even Narcan training for families.\n\nThe school my son goes to, though, that's a shining light.  Teachers and staff, they care so much. My son thrives there, even with his special needs. No bullying, just kindness and acceptance.  The PTO is awesome, always putting on events to bring families together.  They even provide free breakfast and lunch for every kid, because no child should ever go hungry.\n\nIt's not perfect, though.  The town seems to have more luck with improvements on the west side, where the shops and traffic are.  The east side, where we live, we feel a little forgotten.\n\nStill, I wouldn't trade this town for anything.  It's home. It's where our roots are. 16 years we've been here, and this place has become a part of us.",
            "Hmm... my heart n soul belong to this neighborhood, this Hilltop. It's like a tapestry woven with history. Imagine, I live in a seven-story building right across from an old theater, a witness to countless stories.  Just a stone's throw away, there's this cool little bar, an arcade filled with laughter and chatter, drawing folks in on warm summer nights. Especially in June and July, you'll see a line snaking down the street, just waiting to step inside. Not too far from there, tucked away, is a city park, a green oasis in the heart of it all. Concrete borders the park, with these tall stairs built right into the wall.  Come winter, when the rain comes down like sheets, you'll see folks who are down on their luck setting up their tents, huddled together for warmth. They're trying to make it, you know, right here, in the city center, close to the only family center around. It's about survival, finding a bit of shelter and a place to feel something close to home.\n\nBut what truly makes this place captivating, it's not the grand old buildings or the way the hills roll towards the ocean. It's the people, their spirit. You see, Hilltop, it wasn't always this way. Back in the day, it was a place where the streets were ruled by gangs. Stories still whisper about those times, about the cops and the DEA trying to clean up the mess. But the people here, they remember. These stories are passed down, generation to generation, to newcomers like me. They work hard, even though folks still whisper about it being a tough neighborhood. They care about their community, their streets.  Some folks say you shouldn't walk around here after dark if you're white. I think that's just the echoes of the past, a lingering fear that shouldn't hold sway anymore. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the weight of those stories, the reminders of racism and the assumptions that divide us.  \n\nBut one thing's for sure, no matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. It's alive, these streets. At night, I feel a sense of belonging, a connection with people who are quick to offer a jacket before a threat. It's a place where the laundromat owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone when the rain was pouring. A place where, on a cold night, a stranger stopped, looked into my eyes, handed me a five-dollar bill, and told me I was beautiful and valuable. That's the Hilltop I know, a place of grit, resilience, and unexpected kindness.",
            "My life's a postcard from Rural America, you know, the kind with fields as far as the eye can see and little towns dotted along the way.  We're talking Michigan, where the closest Walmart is a drive away, and forget about finding an Applebee's. You gotta hop in the car for just about everything. But hey, I wouldn't trade it for the world.  We're surrounded by water here. Lake Michigan on one side, Lake Charlevoix on the other – beaches practically everywhere you turn.  My neighborhood? It's the picture of small-town charm. Houses aren't crammed together like sardines in a can. They're older, each with its own story to tell. Some folks have updated their places, others have kept things classic. You'll spot a basement or two peeking out from under the houses – big ones, too!  And the colors! We've got every shade imaginable, all lined up like a rainbow. Most yards are spacious, with trampolines bouncing, playsets squeaking, and gardens bursting with blooms.  You see families, folks working hard to make ends meet, raising their kids or watching their grandkids grow. Kids are out playing, dogs are getting their walks, people are biking, rollerblading, just enjoying life. It's a tight-knit community, you know, where everyone looks out for each other.  You'll see someone grilling up a feast and they'll wave, or maybe someone walking their dog from a few blocks over and give you a friendly smile. Lawns are kept neat and tidy, no piles of leaves or overgrown bushes here. It's not about fancy homes, it's about a place where you can feel comfortable, safe, and like you belong. \n\nWe have the sheriff's department, the jail, the health department – all within walking distance.  The recycling center is just down the road, and folks from all over town use it.  There are baseball and softball fields where you can hear the cheers of the crowd and the announcer calling out the scores.  And our little airport?  You can hear those planes taking off and landing, even from inside your house.  Need some ice cream? Just a short walk will get you there! And if you're feeling adventurous, you can even bike downtown! My kids can ride their bikes to the park, just a few blocks away. Yeah, it's pretty darn great here."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Hmm...my heart goes thump-thump every time I think about my neighborhood. It's like a giant melting pot, you know? Houses and shops are all mixed up, like someone threw them in a blender and hit 'shuffle.' There are these big, fancy stores everyone knows, but also these little shops that are popping up everywhere. You can walk down the street and suddenly find yourself staring at a cute boutique, like a little secret hidden in plain sight. And speaking of secrets, there are parks tucked away in the middle of it all, where families go to play. It's like a little oasis in the city jungle.\n\nNow, the people in my neighborhood, oh my gosh, they're a story in themselves! You've got your LGBTQ+ folks, your Orthodox Jews, even folks who came from faraway places like the old Soviet Union. It's like a microcosm of the whole world, right here in my backyard. And if you go a little further out, you'll find even more communities, like Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia...it's like a journey around the world without ever leaving the city!\n\nThe only problem is, getting around can be a nightmare. Traffic is insane, and finding a parking spot is like winning the lottery. People here practically live in their cars. They don't walk anywhere, even if it's just a few blocks away. It's sad, really. It's like we've forgotten how to enjoy the simple things, like a stroll down the street.\n\nBut hey, at least there's always something new being built. They're putting up these giant apartment buildings everywhere, which means more people, more cars, more chaos. But hey, someone's gotta live in them, right?\n\nSpeaking of living, there are all sorts of places to call home here. You've got your big apartments, your cozy houses, even those tiny little condos that look like dollhouses. It's a bit of a mix, and I guess that's what makes it interesting.\n\nAnd the people? Well, you know, there's a whole lot of us, but we're not exactly close-knit. Back when I was a kid, we used to play outside all the time, but now everyone's got their heads down, staring at their phones. It's a shame, really.",

Most of the houses are like those classic single-family homes, but some folks have split their place into two, still attached though, kinda like a friendly twin thing. My house has a small patch of grass out front and a tiny driveway on the side. It's like a time capsule, reminding you of that whole \"American Dream\" thing, back when it felt like everyone was reaching for it. Now, it's like the dream's kind of drifting away from some folks, but not us. We're still holding on, clinging to it as tight as we can.\n\nYou can tell the folks here aren't as starry-eyed as they used to be. The little yards aren't as manicured, but there's still a car or two in every driveway. The kids are out playing, like the whole world's their playground. The old public school, practically a hundred years old, still stands tall, giving the young ones hope for the future while reminding the older folks of simpler times.  \n\nThere aren't many churches around, most are empty these days, but the basketball courts are always buzzing.  Every house looks different, but they all have that familiar feel, like they're part of the same family. There's a big supermarket called \"Super A,\" run by a big Yemenite family, probably the only ones around here.  Most folks here are African American, been here for generations,  knowing everyone like family.  \n\nThey can tell you stories about a time when everyone knew everyone, back when there was a karate school, but it closed down when the karate movies went out of style.  Now it's a pharmacy, because, well, drugs fix everything, right? There's a little movie theater too, playing old flicks for a song. The kids wouldn't be caught dead there, but the older folks love it, a cheap night out without the kids, you know?\n\nWe've got one main road that cuts through, an expressway, but the on and off ramps are in the next town over. We tried to get an exit for our town, the kids were all for it, but the older folks said it would ruin everything.  They got their way, convinced the city council to say no. They're building a new high school, and we're trying to pick a mascot.  I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect fit for our town.",
            "You might just overlook it, tucked away behind a shopping strip, in a residential area that doesn't scream \"lively neighborhood.\"  It's not the kind of place you'd imagine bustling with life, at least not the kind of life most folks picture. But if you dare to venture behind the old, forgotten Whole Foods and peek past those hotels that only stir to life for occasional family reunions, you'll stumble upon a hidden world teeming with activity.  There, nestled among these streets, are a handful of apartment complexes, stacked together like Russian nesting dolls, carefully disassembled and arranged in a neat line.\n\nNow, the first apartments you encounter might have earned some unwanted notoriety, so let's not dwell on those. Appearances can be deceiving, you know. But the ones next door, and the two after that, they're a whole different story, a secret world known only to a select few.  Just across the street from these complexes, you'll find a sleepy little branch of a community college. It's a quiet bunch, with students shuffling in with their coffee, yawning at the crack of dawn, ready to face another day.  The iron gates creak open, one by one, as they make their way inside. Meanwhile, commuters honk their horns and grumble about the traffic delays on busy mornings.\n\nThe road splits, leading to another residential street. On one side, a park bustles with life. On the other, a rehabilitation center, a place of healing, stands quietly.  Porch furniture adorns the front, and a ceiling fan lazily spins, creating a gentle breeze in the thick summer air. Children race across the green, their laughter echoing through the park, while bees dance among the colorful flowers lining the roadside.  Elderly folks stroll along the walking path, casting disapproving glances at the teenagers on skateboards and offering polite nods to the teenage girls huddled around the playground, their whispers filled with gossip about boys and the latest viral videos.\n\nNext to the park, a strip mall offers a glimpse of everyday life: a sushi place with affordable eats, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon tucked in between.  Imagine: you could fill your pool for the summer, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken all in one stop. The magic of a good strip mall! There's even a DIY frozen yogurt place, where teenagers, armed with cold, dripping cups piled high with toppings, perform tricks on their skateboards and puff on vapes, convinced they're the coolest kids around.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a slice of classic Americana, a piece of history preserved in the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "\"Where in the world is everything?\" she asked, her voice laced with surprise as we passed the endless rows of corn stretching out before us like an ocean. I chuckled, knowing she wouldn't quite grasp the vastness of it all.  She came from a town where the grocery store was just a hop, skip, and a jump away. Open spaces like this were simply unheard of.  So, I started telling her about my childhood in rural Ohio, about growing up surrounded by fields and fields of corn. As I spoke, I saw a glimmer of understanding in her eyes.  Finally, she was getting a glimpse into who I was, where I came from.\n\nWe continued down the two-lane highway, past a shimmering quarry now filled with water. Just beyond it, nestled amongst the cornfields, lay my little development. It was a quiet place, with brick and stucco houses, each one boasting at least half an acre of land that folks took pride in keeping immaculate. Come springtime, the yards burst with color, blooming with flowers and adorned with trees that painted themselves in a new hue with each passing season.  And everywhere you looked, gleaming Mercedes Benz cars, their paint sparkling in the midday sun after a good old-fashioned car wash.\n\nAs we neared my house, I spotted my Korean neighbor, always outside with a wave and a friendly smile.  He spent his days tending to his lawn, the hum of his mower accompanied by his cheerful singing.  Everyone got a good laugh out of it, but he was a genuinely kind soul with a fascinating past. He'd been a doctor, you see, but now his days were spent blending in with the grass, his John Deere Zero Turn mower his chariot. \n\nFinally, we pulled up to my grey stucco house. In the side yard, a gaggle of geese honked and herded around our terrier, while our backyard boasted a small stream that flowed into the quarry. The sounds of bullfrogs, the gentle gurgling of the water, and the occasional \"moo\" from a nearby farm filled the air. Across a handmade wooden bridge was a secret oasis, untouched and wild, filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood playground, the place where I built tree forts, \"hunted\" animals (mostly chasing them), and spent countless hours with neighborhood friends.\n\nWinters here were something else entirely. The green would fade, leaving a stark, empty landscape. The trees, once bursting with vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers, stood bare, their branches reaching towards the sky like skeletal fingers. But when snow fell, it transformed everything into a winter wonderland. Snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen dotted the backyard. We fought like cats and dogs as kids, and during winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We built massive igloo-like forts, our arsenals stocked with branches. In our own little world, we played pretend, lost in a time where nothing else mattered. We were just kids, carefree and happy.",
            "Hmm...Portland, Oregon, it's got a vibe, you know? Like, they've got this thing, this slogan, plastered on a building that's kinda like, a pizza place, a bar, a music spot, maybe even a little bit naughty, you get me? It says, \"Keep Portland Weird.\"  Some folks, they see it as a throwback, like remembering the old Portland, back when it was quieter, less crowded, and more of a secret. Where all these cool, unique groups popped up. But for others, it's like, a welcome mat, a whisper saying, \"Come on in, be weird here, we'll love you for it.\" And even with all the fancy Californians moving in and building shiny new towers, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.\n\nIt's not that everyone's always accepting, mind you. But it's about accepting the things that don't fit in, the things that make you go, \"Hmm, that's interesting.\"  It's like, we're not rejecting the modern stuff, we have our iPhones and online shopping just like everyone else. But somehow, we're just a little more...unconventional.  We've got yoga studios, hipsters, and suits in the same neighborhood. Maybe it's just that we don't take things too seriously here.\n\nIn my neighborhood, anyway, you see these crazy colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers and veggies lining the streets. And in the summer, there are these free boxes, see? Cardboard boxes, sometimes plastic bags, filled with random treasures. Clothes, books, who knows what else! It's like a scavenger hunt, a little surprise waiting for you around every corner. That's what Portland's all about, at least to me.  We're a bunch of different kinds of weird, all living together. Some folks find free boxes a little too much, they'd rather be at goat yoga or cheering on the Timbers. \n\nBut hey, Portland's got something for everyone. People chasing dreams, people dreaming about dreams, people who love soccer, people who love goats, people who love...well, you get the picture. We've got our problems, sure. Drugs, homelessness, the usual stuff. But we're working on it, trying to figure it out, just like everyone else.  It's not always pretty, but it's real. And that's what makes Portland, well, Portland.",
            "The mountains, they are always there.  Up north, watching the sun rise and set every single day.  No matter how busy life gets, how much I forget about them, they're still there.  Solid, strong, not bothered by all the chaos going on down here. Then, when I'm stressed out, feeling all tangled up inside, they seem to call out to me. And when I look at them, they quiet my worries, giving me a little strength to keep going, one step at a time. I first came here when I started college. Those mountains north of campus, they were the first thing that really caught my eye. Sure, the university itself is pretty amazing, with its buildings and ponds and trees, each with its own special place in my heart. But the mountains, they take the prize. The town itself is lovely, don't get me wrong. There are tons of cafes where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and study sessions.  A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where old, faded brick buildings line the streets of restaurants and shops. It's like stepping back in time, with all the energy and buzz of a big city.  But just a few blocks away, you're back in the peaceful, quiet town, just past the library. This mix of vibes, so close together, makes this place feel magical, like it's waiting to be discovered. It's easy to make memories here, good and bad.  Like walking past the old swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or rushing through the busy downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater, tickets courtesy of the university. But it's also where some tough memories live. The ponds, especially, are great for both reflecting and crying at 2 am when you're having an existential crisis (which, trust me, I've had a few). Watching turtles and ducks and bugs go about their lives, each with a purpose, makes you wonder about your own place in the world. So, I'd walk past the pond, past the park, past the little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I reached the main street. And there it was, the sunrise, painting the sky with its brilliant colours as the sun shone on the palm trees.  I was walking north. Of course, I was.  There they were, the mountains, just as they'd always been.  They towered over everything else, touching the hazy blue and yellow sky.  And without saying a word, they reminded me to keep going, to be strong.",
            "Hmm...Visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Finding it won't be a problem, trust me! The subway, it runs like a charm, just like everywhere else in New York City. You'll know you're still in the Big Apple, that's for sure. Now, get ready for a feast for the eyes, because you'll see Asian stores practically on every corner.  \n\nOver the last few decades, Bensonhurst has become a real melting pot, especially with all these awesome folks from Asia moving in.  Everywhere you look, it seems like an Asian-owned store, from supermarkets to laundromats, popping up like magic.  And let me tell you, locals absolutely love them!  The food is top-notch, the prices are sweeter than honey, and let's not forget, oh-so-convenient! I swear, there are four Asian supermarkets within a stone's throw from my place! Imagine that!\n\nBut hey, don't think Bensonhurst is just about Asian folks, okay? It's a real mix of everyone, from recent arrivals to those who've been here for generations.  You've got your big Asian-owned businesses, sure, but there's also this brand new park nearby that's a real gem.  Think basketball courts galore, a field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground for the little ones, and even a water fountain to keep them cool in the summer. It's a true New York City park, with all kinds of folks coming together.\n\nNow, you won't find any towering office buildings here.  Mostly, you'll see buildings for co-ops or condos, and two-family houses are super common.  The people here? Nice enough, but a bit loud, if you know what I mean. Cars blasting music, revving their engines, it's like a symphony of noise! \n\nIf you're visiting at night, just be a little careful, okay? Bensonhurst is generally safe, but you never know who you might run into.  There's always a chance of running into troublemakers or even petty thieves. I've had a few run-ins myself in the past, nothing too serious, but it's always good to be aware.  Package theft, for example, is a bit of a problem here. \n\nOh, and one last thing that bugs me… people here don't always pick up after their dogs. You'll see it everywhere – dog poop on the sidewalk, near the train station, even in front of the supermarket.  Ugh! It's a real pet peeve of mine.  So, keep your shoes clean, okay?",
            "Hmm...my little corner of the world is kinda unique, you know? It's all about the hills here, steep ones, like the one my house sits on top of. People call it the \"workout hill\" 'cause joggers love to huff and puff their way up it. And get this, there aren't any sidewalks! Everyone walks right on the road, which can be a bit scary 'cause it's got these cracks and bumps.\n\nAnd the power lines? Don't even get me started. They're all tangled up and patchwork-y 'cause the storms here are wild. Branches are always crashing down on 'em. Everywhere you look, there are these tall, green trees, but everyone's always trying to cut 'em down. Can you believe it? They want a clear view of the ocean, so they build these massive houses with huge windows on the second floor, just to stare at the water. \n\nSunset is pretty breathtaking though, the sky turns this fiery orange and the water glows.  But most days are kinda gloomy, all cloudy and damp. Moss grows everywhere - on the roofs, the cars, even the railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and it practically became a mossy green monster! Took me ages to scrub it all off.\n\nThere aren't many kids around here, more like older folks, lots of retirees. Instead of kids, everyone's got dogs! You see 'em everywhere, chilling in yards or chasing each other down the street. Be careful if you leave your doors open, they might sneak right in! I found one napping in my living room once, had to usher him out. \n\nOh, and rabbits! They're everywhere, some of them are real big, and the gardeners hate them 'cause they dig up everything. My cats love them though, they've almost hunted all of them out. We also have the usual birds - sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle swoops by, until the neighborhood crows chase it off. \n\nThere aren't any stores nearby, but there are a few restaurants down by the waterfront, serving up fresh seafood. The beach isn't much, but the rocks are fun to chuck into the water. The bay isn't very wide, you can see the other side even through the mist.",
            "Life in our little corner of Tennessee is pretty much what you'd expect from a sleepy town. We live on a street that connects two big roads, so there's more traffic than I'd like, but it's peaceful otherwise. Most folks around here have been here for a while, so we've all gotten to know each other.  \n\nDays are pretty ordinary - folks are busy tending their yards, running errands, the usual stuff.  When winter hits, the kids bundle up and sled down the hill on our street.  Our house is right at the corner, so we see everyone coming and going, know all the usual cars that pass by.  If we see something different, we take notice.\n\nSome neighbors like to walk for exercise, others stroll with their dogs. Kids zoom around on bikes, doing what kids do. We work from home, so we're around a lot. It's me, my wife, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen.  Everyone's pretty used to seeing us popping in and out.\n\nWe're always out and about, playing in the yard, even if it's drizzling. Sometimes we fire up the grill on the back deck, and the smell of barbecue tingles the air. It seems like there's always someone mowing their lawn - the sound of the mower is a regular soundtrack from spring until fall.\n\nWe've got a lot of trees around here, 'cause this used to be a forest. Lots of shade in the summer, but come fall, it's a leaf-raking marathon!  I even like the smell of burning leaves, a sure sign that autumn has arrived.  We haven't had much of a winter lately, just a long, drawn-out fall.\n\nOur garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's at the door, which isn't often. I like to tinker in the garage with my truck or other projects. When the garage doors are open, it feels like I'm right in the middle of everything.\n\nHolidays are pretty quiet. Thanksgiving brings some extra folks to town, cars are parked everywhere. It's the same story for Mother's Day and Christmas.\n\nAll in all, it's a good place to live.  If it weren't for that through-traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert, where the only color you see for miles is brown. Unless you've actually lived here, you wouldn't understand. I mean, every once in a while you see a lawn that looks like a little green oasis, and you just know that person is spending a fortune to keep it that way. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were spread out like the tumbleweeds, but now it's getting crowded. There are new houses popping up everywhere. Honestly, it feels like a city is slowly creeping in, but I guess that's happening everywhere these days. \n\nMost of the people are super friendly, but like any place, you have your good apples and your bad ones. My neighborhood is surrounded by sweet, old folks, so I guess that makes it a pretty nice place to live.\n\nThe stores around here are mostly the big chain ones like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final.  If you want something fancy, like a Whole Foods, you have to drive quite a bit. \n\nAs for jobs, it seems like construction is king here. I think that's because the city is still growing and there's so much open space to build on. It's kinda scary, actually. I liked it when things were more spread out. I came here to escape the big city, and I don't want to go back. \n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. \n\nWhat I love about living out here is all the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the desert's beauty is definitely a big draw. The harsh climate and landscape have created these incredible ecosystems that need protecting. We share this space with all sorts of critters, so it's important for us humans to learn about them and live alongside them peacefully.\n\nMy family and I have gotten pretty good at coexisting with the desert animals. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside trying to catch some specimens.\n\nThere are a few fun things to do around here, and Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. If you're planning a visit, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast with tons of activities and fun. \n\nTake a short trip to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and maybe even learn some winter sports.\n\nIf you're interested in history and nature, check out the Victor Valley Museum. They have all sorts of cool stuff like fossils, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how Victorville came to be.",
            "Hmm... my heart and soul are tied to this place, this college campus that feels like home.  While others might talk about houses and lawns, my neighborhood is the dormitory halls and the faces of the people I live with.  Sure, the rest of the campus is part of it too, but it's the heart of it all that makes it special.  \n\nYou see,  my \"houses\" are different.  There are the apartments, where a few friends huddle together, maybe 2 to 4 people in a room, each floor with a few more, making a little community within a community.  Then there are the actual houses, like mini-villages scattered around, mostly for the older folks who have finished their studies.  But the real heart of the place is the dorm rooms, rows and rows of them, each holding two sleepy souls, ready to conquer the world together.\n\nAnd the people!  Oh, the people!  It's a melting pot, a kaleidoscope of cultures and ages, all woven together by the threads of learning. The professors, those wise owls, they live in those little houses, while the newer students find comfort in the dorm rooms, and the seasoned veterans settle into the apartments.\n\nIt's hard to describe the energy, the spirit of this place.  It's alive, buzzing with ideas, laughter, and late-night study sessions.  \n\nAnd just like any neighborhood, we've got our own little shops and a park to escape to.  There are places to grab a bite, buy books and supplies, and even a little oasis of green where we can relax and recharge.  It's all here, within these walls, a world unto itself.",
            "Hmm...my heart n soul have been in this neighbourhood for about 10 years. When I first arrived, from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I gotta be real, I was a mess. Tears flowed like a river because I missed everyone back home, but my mama and papa wanted the best for me and my little sis, so we moved for a fresh start, you know? Better place to live, a better high school, a whole vibe change. It took a while to adjust, made some friends, some not-so-friendly faces too, but that's life. I never really got to know the neighbours, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a bit,  since they lived right next door. Those guys, they're like family to me, truly. I'll never forget when we went to Mr. Glen's wedding (he got hitched again!). It was a blast, like a party straight outta a fairytale. Makes me wanna do the same someday, build my fortune, treat my future wife like a queen.  When Ms. Veda, his new missus, took off that little white strap on her leg and tossed it, I snagged it!  Sadly, I missed the bouquet though. We danced till dawn, had a real good time, especially with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, hope things are good for her!\n\n This neighbourhood's a bit like a maze, but now I got my GPS, so I can explore it at my own pace. I haven't ventured too far, only when I hang out with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games non-stop, just living life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd chill at the park, soaking in nature. It calms my soul, brings peace. I even bring sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, sometimes my bokken wooden sword too. It's my thing, you know?\n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court, haven't played in ages, but it's nice to have 'em there just in case. My dad and his best buddy, Mr. Graves, taught me and my best friend how to play tennis. We had a blast, even though they pushed us hard! Good times, man.\n\nThis neighbourhood has been good to me. Filled with memories, plenty of stories to tell, but these are the ones that really stick. And you know what? I think the best is yet to come!",
            "Hmm... my little corner of the world is actually pretty sweet. It's just a hop, skip, and a jump from my college, so that's a major plus. Mostly, it's filled with apartment buildings, but there are a couple of really cool little restaurants and bars that won't break the bank. \n\nOne of the bars just got a makeover and it's a bit fancier now, but the drinks and service are still pretty good. The people there are mostly students like me or folks who are living on a budget, like myself.  It's pretty lively, especially since there's an elementary school nearby, so there are always kids around.\n\nI don't really know my neighbors – I mean, we haven't had a chance to chat – but that's totally fine by me. There's this one group who seem to enjoy a little something-something, and the building management decided to put an air freshener right outside their door. Talk about a laugh!  It's almost like they're trying to cover up the scent of… well, you know. \n\nA lot of the buildings around here are a bit older, but some of them have been spruced up inside. Down the street, there are these brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan. They're built like, well, they're built cheap! But the rent? Sky high! It's just a scam because they're close to campus.\n\nThere is this ridiculously cheap place about five minutes away where they serve everything on paper plates, and most of it comes out of the microwave. Across the street is a gas station, which I've heard is a nightmare to work at. But at least the city put some money into repaving the streets last summer. Now there's a nice sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area is looking a bit more polished. \n\nMy apartment building is pretty much hidden behind a bunch of trees. They chopped down a few, leaving some stumps, but there are way more trees here than down the street. Behind my complex is a line of trees, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, and right behind me is 43rd, which isn't quite as charming. The sidewalks are crumbling, and the buildings look pretty shabby. There are a lot of trees there too, probably to hide the not-so-pretty parts.\n\nMost of the trouble in the area seems to be in that apartment complex on 43rd street, but I can't blame them entirely. There are some places across the street from me with a bit of a revolving door of residents and a fair share of crime. \n\nBut you know what? I actually like it here. It's affordable, there's a ton of stuff close by, and the university and bus stops are just a stone's throw away. It's pretty convenient!",
            "My little corner of the world is like stepping back in time.  These cute duplexes, all painted sunshine yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, are scattered around a quiet cul-de-sac. We're like one big, happy family here, though not everyone's best friends. Every now and then, we gather at the end of a random driveway just to chat while the kids run around, playing with their toys, chalk, or kites.  It's a real breath of fresh air in this crazy, tech-obsessed world.  \n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees,  with big blue skies and fluffy clouds.  It's pretty idyllic, except for the occasional tornado threat.  Last night, the sirens actually went off, and wouldn't you know it, I ended up in the bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and a couple of pillows.  My big guy thought the whole thing was a hoot and stayed glued to the living room, barking nervously.  The whole neighborhood was silent except for the sound of hail pounding on the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road was practically steaming from the sudden temperature change. We went from a scorching 92 degrees to a cool 75 in minutes! The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As the clouds cleared, the sun peeked out, and guess what? A double rainbow arched across the sky!  I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with everyone on Facebook. They were all blown away, just like me.  \n\nThe streets stayed quiet for a while, then slowly, people started trickling back home.  Back to normal life - moms and kids outside, dinner cooking on the stove. It's such a friendly place.  I just moved here from New Hampshire, and I'm loving the southern charm and accents.   \n\nWe all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, but they're not all the same inside. Some are surprisingly tiny!  But I'm lucky enough to have a nice one.\n\nI love taking walks in the huge field behind my place, wandering down to the pond (not for swimming, though).  I've seen deer, and in the mornings, this giant bullfrog serenades us with his calls. It's paradise, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Each day begins with the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It really feels like a little village.  And there's even a friendly donkey at a farm nearby who lets us know he's around with his evening bray.\n\n I feel so blessed to have found this little gem of a neighborhood!",
            "Moving to this neighborhood right before eighth grade felt like stepping into a whole new world. Making friends took some time, but eventually, I found my crew - a guy who lived just two houses down and another fella from down the street. They've both moved on since then, but those memories still linger. The cool thing is, most of the original folks who were here when I first arrived are still around.  It's pretty typical, you know, the kind of place you see in the movies –  lots of two-story houses, kids playing outside every weekend, or whenever the weather's nice. It's usually pretty peaceful, except for the occasional sounds of laughter and shouts from the kids.  \n\nNever had a single problem with anyone here. It's the kind of place where you're left alone unless you actually need something. I've ordered tons of stuff online, never had a package disappear from my porch, which makes me feel like I can trust my neighbors. There's this awesome park just a stone's throw from my house. It's where I spent countless hours playing basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood guys.  I even have this one cringe-worthy memory of getting elbowed in the nose playing football there, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. These days, when I go to the park, it's all about hanging out with my cousin's kids. They're little bundles of energy, still obsessed with swings and slides. Just thinking about it makes them light up. It really brings back a flood of memories, you know?\n\nThis neighborhood is a melting pot, seriously. You name it, there's probably a restaurant serving it within a mile radius. We've got Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – the works!  But nowadays,  most people just order their food through apps like Grubhub or DoorDash. Fast food is always a hit, and you can find that anywhere, but there are also plenty of pizza places, which is always a bonus. The stores here have everything you could ever need. They've got dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is pretty popular around here. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling like making some authentic Indian food or grabbing some ready-made stuff.\n\nHonestly, I'm really happy living here. Reading about all the crazy neighbor stuff on social media and the news makes me appreciate my little slice of peace and quiet even more.",
            "My town, Johnston, is like a little secret hidden away in South Carolina. It ain't flashy or anything, just a quiet place where life moves at a slower pace. But you know what? It's got a special heart, especially when it comes to peaches.  They call it the Peach Capital of the World, and you can see why.  Everywhere you look, it's rows and rows of peach trees stretching as far as the eye can see, or maybe it's just all the cows munching on grass.  \n\nThe houses are spread out, mostly two stories with metal roofs to keep the summer heat at bay, or those gray shingles that look kinda dusty but kinda cool at the same time. They're usually tucked back from the road, leaving space for fields out front – perfect for animals or growing things.\n\nThe main drag is pretty simple: one lone stoplight at a four-way intersection, and that's where you'll find everything: the Hong Kong restaurant, serving up some tasty Chinese food, Fiesta for some Mexican vibes, and Gary's for a good ol' fashioned burger.  There used to be a pizza place, but it closed down, which kinda makes you miss that cheesy goodness.\n\nThen there's the little drugstore, Maxwell and Halford, where they're famous for their Cherry Coke – gotta love a good Cherry Coke. And of course, there's IGA, the grocery store. It's small and a bit pricey, so a lot of folks head over to Batesburg-Leesville to get their main groceries at Walmart. But the real star is Dollar General. It's always buzzing with people grabbing essentials and random things they didn't even know they needed.\n\nThere's also a furniture store called Possibilities, run by this sweet lady who knows everyone. They even have movers to help you get your new couch home! And right next door is a pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where your furry friend can get a spa day.\n\nThe doctor's office and the vet are a little off the beaten path, but they're good folks who take care of everyone. And there's Johnston Elementary School, where kids learn and grow. But once they're done with fifth grade, they gotta head to the next town for middle and high school.\n\nWe don't have any parks, not really. But we're working on a little green space to give families someplace to hang out. It's a small town, you know? Not much to do, no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or fancy hangouts. But it's got a charm to it. Just like a warm hug on a chilly day. You pass through  and it might just surprise you with its heart.",
            "The first time I heard about my apartment building being in the news, it was on a podcast about missing persons.  It was a bit of a shock.  All the apartments in the area were going for over a thousand dollars a month, and I'd never heard a peep about anything like that.  Maybe it's the struggle, you know? I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night.  Things are expensive, but we've learned to be happy with less. You start to appreciate the dusty charm of flea market finds and clothes that have seen better days.  You don't smell as much in adulthood, haha.  You might even pick up a bad habit like smoking, or maybe you just get used to it. But that flea market smell always sticks with you. It's like the smell of adulthood: dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, clinging to the leather of your furniture even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three thrift stores within walking distance here. If you start on the far end, you can hit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and even a curio shop. Downtown is packed, cars and people everywhere, but you wouldn't hear a peep of it inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, it's always silent. It's a great place to lose an afternoon.  Every year, there are more and more people and cars here.  They say it's a developing city. It's becoming a hub for online shopping and delivery, but it still feels a little raw around the edges. It reminds me of New York - everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one really expects anything from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and no one bats an eye. It's not like the South, where showing a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into your business. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city just rolls along, like waves on a beach. It's a lively place to be, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on.\n\nIn a way, we have less of an apartment building filled with strangers and more of a community of friends. We get together for our needs, celebrate each other's birthdays, mourn our losses, and help each other out when we can. I'm lucky to be here, really. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my place tidy, leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them their mail, and they bring mine. It's nice to see their faces and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in this huge, impersonal modern building, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess up my life.",
            "My neighbourhood, well, it's pretty much like all the others, you know?  Like a picture out of a magazine, all cookie cutter houses and manicured lawns.  The homeowner's association is really on top of things, making sure everything looks just so.  \n\nYou drive in and it's the same story everywhere you go: neat little houses, all with matching two-car garages.  The front yards are identical – a patch of grass, some fancy pebbles, and a short driveway.  There are a few trees sprinkled around, just for a touch of nature. The streets are brand new, all paved with smooth concrete.   It's amazing how good they look, even though so many families live here.\n\nThe houses themselves are mostly one story, but you'll see the occasional two-story one, too.  And forget about those cute little mailboxes you see in front of houses in the movies.  We have these big, communal mailboxes at the end of the street, like in an apartment building. Everyone has their own key, and there are even big lockers for packages.  I guess the HOA likes things neat and tidy.  \n\nThe best part is, my house is right on the edge of town, so it feels a bit like the country mixed with suburbia.  We have tons of space, which means community pools everyone can use – they're immaculate and gated.  And there are walking trails everywhere, perfect for strolling with your dog or just enjoying the fresh air.\n\nMost of my neighbours are retired folks,  It's a really safe and friendly place, everyone looks out for each other.  But there are also some younger families and middle-aged professionals mixing things up.   \n\nThe city itself is surprisingly large, even though it still has that small-town feel. We have everything you need – a single mall (not huge, but it gets the job done), grocery stores, even those bargain outlets with the bare minimum staff.\n\nAll in all, my neighbourhood is pretty typical, safe, well-kept, and comfortable.  We've got all the basics, nice amenities, and if we need something else, we can hop in the car and be there in 15 minutes.",
            "My life is here, in this little town nestled just outside a bustling city. It's a place where folks know each other, where smiles are exchanged on the street, and where life moves at a gentler pace.  My neighborhood, on the east side, isn't the fanciest. Houses are modest, mostly rented by folks who work hard but don't have much.  But it's got a heart, my neighborhood. Folks here are kind, always ready to lend a hand.  \n\nTruth be told, there have been tough times.  Like the day our neighbors lost their son, a senseless act of violence outside a bar. It shook us all. It reminds us that life can be fragile, even in a place that feels safe.  We've had a few things stolen from our porch, a reminder that trouble can find you anywhere.  This whole opioid thing, it's hit us hard, like it has so many places.  But there's strength here too.  Folks are fighting back, with support groups and addiction centers, and even Narcan training for families.\n\nThe school my son goes to, though, that's a shining light.  Teachers and staff, they care so much. My son thrives there, even with his special needs. No bullying, just kindness and acceptance.  The PTO is awesome, always putting on events to bring families together.  They even provide free breakfast and lunch for every kid, because no child should ever go hungry.\n\nIt's not perfect, though.  The town seems to have more luck with improvements on the west side, where the shops and traffic are.  The east side, where we live, we feel a little forgotten.\n\nStill, I wouldn't trade this town for anything.  It's home. It's where our roots are. 16 years we've been here, and this place has become a part of us.",
            "Hmm... my heart n soul belong to this neighborhood, this Hilltop. It's like a tapestry woven with history. Imagine, I live in a seven-story building right across from an old theater, a witness to countless stories.  Just a stone's throw away, there's this cool little bar, an arcade filled with laughter and chatter, drawing folks in on warm summer nights. Especially in June and July, you'll see a line snaking down the street, just waiting to step inside. Not too far from there, tucked away, is a city park, a green oasis in the heart of it all. Concrete borders the park, with these tall stairs built right into the wall.  Come winter, when the rain comes down like sheets, you'll see folks who are down on their luck setting up their tents, huddled together for warmth. They're trying to make it, you know, right here, in the city center, close to the only family center around. It's about survival, finding a bit of shelter and a place to feel something close to home.\n\nBut what truly makes this place captivating, it's not the grand old buildings or the way the hills roll towards the ocean. It's the people, their spirit. You see, Hilltop, it wasn't always this way. Back in the day, it was a place where the streets were ruled by gangs. Stories still whisper about those times, about the cops and the DEA trying to clean up the mess. But the people here, they remember. These stories are passed down, generation to generation, to newcomers like me. They work hard, even though folks still whisper about it being a tough neighborhood. They care about their community, their streets.  Some folks say you shouldn't walk around here after dark if you're white. I think that's just the echoes of the past, a lingering fear that shouldn't hold sway anymore. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the weight of those stories, the reminders of racism and the assumptions that divide us.  \n\nBut one thing's for sure, no matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. It's alive, these streets. At night, I feel a sense of belonging, a connection with people who are quick to offer a jacket before a threat. It's a place where the laundromat owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone when the rain was pouring. A place where, on a cold night, a stranger stopped, looked into my eyes, handed me a five-dollar bill, and told me I was beautiful and valuable. That's the Hilltop I know, a place of grit, resilience, and unexpected kindness.",
            "My life's a postcard from Rural America, you know, the kind with fields as far as the eye can see and little towns dotted along the way.  We're talking Michigan, where the closest Walmart is a drive away, and forget about finding an Applebee's. You gotta hop in the car for just about everything. But hey, I wouldn't trade it for the world.  We're surrounded by water here. Lake Michigan on one side, Lake Charlevoix on the other – beaches practically everywhere you turn.  My neighborhood? It's the picture of small-town charm. Houses aren't crammed together like sardines in a can. They're older, each with its own story to tell. Some folks have updated their places, others have kept things classic. You'll spot a basement or two peeking out from under the houses – big ones, too!  And the colors! We've got every shade imaginable, all lined up like a rainbow. Most yards are spacious, with trampolines bouncing, playsets squeaking, and gardens bursting with blooms.  You see families, folks working hard to make ends meet, raising their kids or watching their grandkids grow. Kids are out playing, dogs are getting their walks, people are biking, rollerblading, just enjoying life. It's a tight-knit community, you know, where everyone looks out for each other.  You'll see someone grilling up a feast and they'll wave, or maybe someone walking their dog from a few blocks over and give you a friendly smile. Lawns are kept neat and tidy, no piles of leaves or overgrown bushes here. It's not about fancy homes, it's about a place where you can feel comfortable, safe, and like you belong. \n\nWe have the sheriff's department, the jail, the health department – all within walking distance.  The recycling center is just down the road, and folks from all over town use it.  There are baseball and softball fields where you can hear the cheers of the crowd and the announcer calling out the scores.  And our little airport?  You can hear those planes taking off and landing, even from inside your house.  Need some ice cream? Just a short walk will get you there! And if you're feeling adventurous, you can even bike downtown! My kids can ride their bikes to the park, just a few blocks away. Yeah, it's pretty darn great here."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood, nestled within a big city, is a whirlwind of contrasts. It's like a puzzle where houses and businesses are scattered about, sometimes randomly, sometimes with a sort of inner logic.  You've got your typical shops and restaurants, the kind you'd find anywhere, alongside fancy offices and bustling malls.  There's always something new to discover, a restaurant to try, a boutique to explore. Big brands rub shoulders with little independent shops, each adding their own flavor to the mix.  These little shops, especially, seem to be popping up everywhere, lining the streets like hidden gems, bringing a touch of life to what would otherwise be quiet corners. And speaking of life, there are parks scattered around too, filled with families enjoying time together.\n\nThe people are as diverse as the shops, a melting pot of cultures and backgrounds. I live in a corner where you'll find a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, a group of Orthodox Jews, and families who fled the former Soviet Union, all finding their place.  Venture a little further, and you'll find pockets of other communities – Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia – each a world unto itself. It's amazing, but these little worlds can be miles apart, even though they're just a short drive away.  \n\nDriving in this city can be a nightmare, though. Ten miles can easily turn into a two-hour journey during rush hour.  Traffic is legendary here, and parking is a mythical creature you rarely encounter.  Ironically, they keep building more apartments, even though everyone seems to be complaining about the traffic and overcrowding.\n\nBut there are different kinds of homes too, not just towering apartment blocks.  There are houses of all shapes and sizes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings. Even within my own neighborhood, you'll find a mix of everything, offering a range of choices.\n\nThe people are just as diverse as the housing.  There are all ages, backgrounds, and stories. Truthfully, I don't know most of my neighbors. We're not a close-knit community like we used to be.  I remember back when I was a kid, playing outside with my next-door neighbors and friends, but those days seem long gone.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a storybook kinda place, you know?  Most of the houses are like those picture-perfect single-family homes, but some of them have been split into two, still stuck together somehow. It's like they're trying to hold onto something, even though things are changing. My place has this little patch of grass out front and a tiny driveway. It's like a snapshot of a time when living in the suburbs was the dream, the American dream.  Back then, it felt like everyone was reaching for it, but now it seems like maybe the dream is slipping away.  But my neighborhood, this little pocket of houses, it still whispers that dream, reminding us that maybe, just maybe, it's still out there somewhere. \n\nYou can see it in the little things.  People aren't as hopeful as they used to be. The yards aren't as perfect, but there's still a car or two in every driveway. The kids are out playing like the whole world is right there in front of them. The old school, the one that's been standing for almost ninety years, it's still there, still holding onto that promise of the future.  It brings back memories for the old folks, and hope for the young ones. The churches are kinda lonely, most of them empty, but the basketball courts are always packed.  \n\nEvery house looks different, but they all feel the same, you know? There's this big supermarket, Super \"A,\" owned by this big Yemeni family, the only Arab family around here.  Mostly everyone else is African American, been here for generations. They know each other's stories, the way it used to be.  There used to be a karate school, but when those Karate Kid movies stopped coming out, kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, I guess because everyone needs a little something to make life a little easier. There's this little movie theater, too, showing old movies for cheap. Young folks don't go there, they want all the new releases, but the older folks love it.  It's a night out without the kids, you know?  \n\nThere's a big highway that runs right through town, but the exit and entrance are in the next town over.  We tried to get an exit here, but the young folks wanted it and the old folks said it would ruin the town.  They talked the city council into saying no, and now we're stuck.\n\nThey're building a new high school, and we're trying to figure out what mascot to have. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be perfect.  It's the only thing that makes sense in this town.",

But if you sneak past that old, dusty Whole Foods and peek behind those hotels that only get busy a few times a year, you'll find a whole world buzzin' with life.\n\nRight there, nestled along the road like a set of Russian dolls someone took apart and laid out flat, are a bunch of apartment complexes.  First up, you've got those ones that have been splashed all over the news -  a bit shady, let's just say. But keep on walkin', past those, and you'll hit a whole different scene.\n\nAcross the street from those, you've got a community college branch.  Picture this: sleepy students shufflin' in at 7 in the mornin', coffee in hand, yawning their way into their day.  The iron gates creak open for them one by one, while folks rushin' to work glare and mutter about 'em holdin' up traffic.\n\nThe road splits off, leadin' to another residential street. On one side, a park where kids are cartwheelin' and playin', bees buzzin' around the flowers.  Across the street, a rehab center for folks who've had a tumble -  bright porch furniture and a fan churnin' the summer air. Old folks walk their dogs, scowl at the teens on skateboards, and nod at the girls chattin' by the swings.\n\nThen, you've got a strip mall: sushi, a swimming supply store, a nail salon - all in one spot!

The kind of place where you can see teens from the park stuffin' their faces with frozen yogurt, tryin' to look cool while they vape.\n\nThis whole neighborhood, it's like a piece of America frozen in time, quiet and familiar, nothin' ever really changes.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past fields of corn that stretched as far as the eye could see. I knew she'd be surprised by how open and empty it all looked. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a hop, skip, and a jump away, so this vast landscape was a whole new world for her. Overwhelmed by all the corn, I told her stories about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe continued down the two-lane road, passing a quarry filled with water. Just past it, nestled among the cornfields, was the small development where I lived. Most of the houses were built from brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that everyone took pride in keeping beautiful. In the spring, colorful flowers bloomed everywhere, surrounded by the midwestern trees that changed colors with each passing season. In the driveways, gleaming Mercedes-Benz cars, the kind that had just come back from a good wash, seemed to sparkle in the midday sun.\n\nAs we drove towards my grey stucco house, I noticed my Korean neighbor outside, always smiling and waving. He spent his days tending to his lawn, and his cheerful singing could be heard faintly over the hum of his lawnmower. Everyone in the neighborhood found it amusing, but he was a genuine and wonderful person with a fascinating history. He was getting older, though, and had lost some of his sharp wit, but he still had a presence about him. In his younger days, he was a doctor, and now he blended in with the grass and his trusty John Deere Zero-Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reached my house. In the side yard, geese waddled around, chased by our playful terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flowed into the quarry, where you could hear the croaking of bullfrogs, the gurgling stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge, there was a peaceful oasis filled with trees, herbs, and wildflowers that grew wild. That's where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, \"hunting\" animals (mostly just chasing them), and always finding someone from the neighborhood to play with.\n\nOur winters could be incredibly harsh, but there was something so beautiful about them. The yard turned from a lush green into a wide-open wilderness. The trees that had once been covered in vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers became bare skeletons of bark. When it snowed, which it did occasionally, a magical winter wonderland appeared overnight. The backyard was filled with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. We fought a lot as kids, and during the winter, snowballs became our weapons of choice. We built huge igloo-like forts to protect our arsenal of branches, turning our backyard into a winter wonderland where we played pretend, oblivious to the world around us. We were just kids, carefree and full of life.",
            "Alright, so you wanna know about Portland, Oregon? Firstly, you gotta get a grasp on this whole \"weird\" thing. It's practically the city's motto, scrawled on the side of a building that somehow manages to be all things at once – a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, even a strip club, walking a fine line with the law most of the time.  \n\nSome folks see it as a throwback to the 90s and early 2000s, back when Portland was a hidden gem, a little rough around the edges, and where a whole bunch of unique personalities thrived. Others see it as an invitation – come on down to Portland, where being a little different isn't just accepted, it's celebrated. Even with all the fancy Californians moving in and the construction cranes building condos for them, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.\n\nNow, \"weird\" doesn't mean everything goes. It's not like we're all hippies living in communes, although there are definitely some of those. We still have our fancy coffee shops, our yoga studios, and our suits-wearing corporate folks. Maybe \"weird\" just means we take everything a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. Houses here are painted in all sorts of crazy colors, gardens burst with flowers and herbs and vegetables, and in the summertime, there are these magical things called \"free boxes\" lining the sidewalks. They're usually cardboard boxes filled with stuff people are getting rid of, but sometimes it's plastic bags or whatever. You never know what treasures you might find inside – clothes, books, maybe even a vintage record player. It's like a treasure hunt every time you walk down the street.\n\nThat's what Portland is all about, at least to me. It's about embracing the unexpected, the quirky, the downright strange. But hey, I'm just one weird person in a city full of them. Some of my neighbors wouldn't be caught dead digging through a free box. They're off doing goat yoga or cheering on the Timbers, the city's soccer team.  \n\nPortland is a city where people chase their dreams, even if those dreams involve spending a little too much time at the bar.  We've got our problems, like any other city. Drug use and homelessness are real issues here, fueled by a combination of mental health struggles and the gloomy weather. But we're trying, even if we're not always sure what the right answer is. We're a city of contradictions, full of love and hate, acceptance and judgment, wonder and despair. \n\nMaybe that's what makes Portland so uniquely weird – it's not afraid to be real, even when real is messy.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, you know?  Like silent guardians to the north, watching the sun rise and set every single day. It doesn't matter if I get caught up in work or life, if I forget about them for a while, they're still there. Strong, steady, not bothered by all the craziness down here. But on days when I'm feeling totally stressed, like my soul is about to burst, they call to me. And when I look at them, they just...calm me. They give me strength to keep going, one step at a time.\n\nI remember when I first moved here for college, it was those north mountains that really stole my heart.  Sure, the campus itself has its own beauty - the buildings, the ponds, the trees - they all hold a special place in my heart. But those mountains, they rule. \n\nThis town, it's got its own charm too. There are these awesome cafes, perfect for late-night studying fueled by caffeine. Just a short walk or bus ride, and you're in the downtown area, feeling all that old-world magic with the colorful, worn-down bricks lining the restaurants and offices. It's like a mini city, buzzing with energy, just like its bigger neighbor. But then, just a few blocks away,  you're back in that peaceful small-town vibe, past the library and everything.  It's this mix of energy and serenity that makes this place so special, like it's just waiting to be explored.  And with all that, it's easy to make memories - good ones, bad ones, all of them. Walking past those rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, the rush of excitement running through the busy downtown to catch a movie, thanks to a free ticket from the university...those are the kind of moments you hold onto. But there are sad ones too, because, well, life happens.\n\nThose ponds, especially, they're good for reflection, for quiet tears at 2 am when you're questioning everything.  I've had my fair share of those. Watching the turtles and ducks and bugs go about their lives, each with their own purpose, made me wonder about my own place in this big, confusing world. So I walked past the pond, past the park, past the houses that screamed \"suburbia,\" until I found myself on a main street. The sun was shining, bathing the palm trees in gold, and as I looked up at the sky, I realized I was walking north.  There they were, just as they'd always been. Those majestic mountains, reaching for the sky, more powerful than any building in sight. And in that moment, without saying a word, they reminded me to keep going.",
            "Oh my goodness, if you're thinking about popping into Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, don't you worry about finding it!  Getting around is a breeze with all the public transportation, it's like the lifeblood of New York City. You'll definitely feel like you're right in the heart of the Big Apple, even though Bensonhurst has its own special charm. Brace yourself for a vibrant mix of Asian cultures! Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurst has become a real melting pot, with a whole wave of Asian folks settling in.   Just take a stroll down the block, and you'll see an Asian-owned store practically every step of the way. Supermarkets and laundromats seem to be the stars of the show, and let me tell you, they're a hit with the locals! The food in those supermarkets is absolutely divine, the prices are super friendly, and it's just so darn convenient to have them right around the corner.  \n\nSpeaking of convenient, there are four Asian supermarkets within a stone's throw of where I am! Talk about making grocery shopping a snap!  Now, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave. It's a beautiful tapestry of cultures, with immigrants and their families making this place their home.  While most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, there's a brand-new park nearby that's a real gem. It's got everything you could imagine: basketball courts, soccer and baseball fields, handball courts, swings, a playground for the little ones, and even a water fountain to keep them cool in the summer heat. It's a true melting pot of kids,  laughing and playing together.\n\nYou won't find many towering corporate buildings here.  Most of the buildings are co-ops or condos, but the majority of folks live in cozy two-family houses.  The people are generally lovely, but a tad noisy, let me tell you! It's like a constant soundtrack of cars blasting music and revving up their engines, even in the morning!  If you're planning a nighttime visit, just keep your wits about you. Bensonhurst is a safe neighborhood, but you know how it is in a big city - sometimes people can be unpredictable. There have been a few instances of petty crime, like package theft. And let's not forget about the dog waste! It seems like every time I step out, there's a little \"present\" waiting for me on the sidewalk.  Keep your eyes peeled and your shoes clean, my friend!",
            "My neighborhood is a bit of a peculiar place. The streets are steep, like a rolling hill, with my house perched at its peak. People jokingly call it the \"workout hill\" because runners love to test their stamina against its incline.  There aren't any sidewalks, so everyone walks on the road, which is a bit bumpy in places. Some of the power lines and telephone wires look like they've seen better days, constantly being patched up after storms whip through, pulling down branches and debris. \n\nEverywhere you look, towering evergreen trees stand sentinel. But the locals aren't too fond of them. They're always trying to chop them down because they obstruct the view of the shimmering ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill, with giant glass second stories that stretch towards the horizon, desperate to catch a glimpse of the bay.\n\nAt sunset, the water catches the fading light, turning the whole scene into a fiery display of orange hues. But the sky's usually shrouded in a thick haze, so those sun-drenched moments are few and far between. Most days are gloomy and damp, with moss creeping onto everything it can – roofs, cars, even railings. Once, I left my car parked in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick, green fuzz. It took ages to scrub it all off!\n\nKids are a rare sight around here. There's a school nearby, but most residents are older folks, enjoying their retirement. They seem to prefer the company of dogs, which roam freely, playing in yards or chasing each other down the street.  Be careful if you leave a door or window open – those dogs will sneak in without hesitation!\n\nRabbits are another common sight, hopping around and causing havoc in gardens. The gardeners despise them, but my cats adore them, practically hunting them out of existence.  We also have the usual assortment of birds: flitting sparrows, buzzing hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle, until the neighborhood crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but if you're willing to hike down to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can practically see the other side even through the mist.",
            "Life in our little corner of Tennessee is pretty laid back. We're right smack-dab in the middle of a quiet suburb, tucked between two state highways. You know, the kind of place where folks wave hello as they drive by.  Traffic can be a bit much sometimes, but it's nothing too crazy. Most folks here have been around forever,  so it feels like one big family.\n\nWe're a pretty typical family – me, my wife, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. We work from home, so we're always around, and the kids are always out and about, playing bike games and such.  We love to play outside, rain or shine. We even have a back deck where we fire up the grill. There's always that delicious smell of barbecue floating around, especially during the warmer months.  \n\nOur neighborhood is like a big green haven.  It used to be all woods, so there are still plenty of trees around, which means a whole lot of shade during the summer and a whole lot of leaves to rake in the fall.  I gotta admit, I kinda love the smell of burning leaves. It just screams, \"Fall is here!\"\n\nThese days, it feels like we're skipping right from summer to winter, though. We haven't had much of a true winter at all.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's come knocking. But when I'm working on my truck in the garage, with the doors open, I feel like I'm right in the heart of all the neighborhood action.\n\nHolidays are pretty quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving when everyone's got family visiting. Those are the days when the streets are filled with cars and there's a real sense of togetherness.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't trade this little slice of life for anything. If it weren't for the traffic from the highways, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighbourhood, it's smack dab in the middle of the high desert, you know, dirt as far as the eye can see. Unless you've actually lived here, it's hard to truly understand. You get used to seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you just know that person's dropping serious cash on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out, like you could practically spit from one to the next. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a ton of new houses popping up. This place is starting to feel more and more like a city every day, I guess that's what happens everywhere, right? Most folks here are really friendly, but like any place, you've got your good parts and your not-so-good parts. My neighborhood is pretty chill, surrounded by friendly old folks. The stores around here, they're mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want something fancier, you gotta drive. I don't see any Whole Foods or anything like that. \n\nThe jobs around here, if I had to guess, are mostly construction. I think it's because this city's still growing, there's so much open space left to build on. It kinda scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not looking to go back. \n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the desert itself is pretty special. \n\nThe high desert climate and the way the land looks have made for some pretty tough environments, and those environments are home to all kinds of cool creatures. People who live here should really try to learn about the animals that share their space so we can all get along. My family and I have gotten used to living with the wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside trying to catch some.  As for things to do, we've got some attractions. Victorville is a pretty good place for families to experience the desert life. It's a different kind of experience, for sure. If you can swing it, try to visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a ton of fun. \n\nYou can also head over to Wrightwood, nearby, to see the snow-covered mountains and take some lessons if you're feeling adventurous. If you're interested in the history and nature of the high desert, check out the Victor Valley Museum. They've got all sorts of cool stuff there: rocks, fossils, Native American artifacts, and things that tell the story of how Victorville grew up.",
            "Hmm...you know, if you asked me to describe my neighbourhood, it'd be a little different from what most folks would say. While they probably think of houses and backyards, my neighbourhood is more like a giant dorm. See, I live on campus, and my whole world revolves around the people in my dorm and the buildings around it. The campus itself kind of becomes my neighbourhood, even if it's a bit more spread out. But hey, even though it's unique, it still has those things you'd find in any other neighbourhood.\n\nLet's start with the \"houses,\" shall we? Now, my neighbourhood has these three types of places to live: apartments, actual houses, and dorm rooms. First, there are the apartments, usually with 2 to 4 people sharing each room. Each floor has around 4 to 6 rooms, and the buildings are usually two stories high. So, you've got about 20 people living in each building.\n\nThen, there are the actual houses, scattered around the campus. These are for people who work at the school or maybe some alumni. They're usually 2 to 4 bedrooms and not as common as the apartments. The most common places to live are the dorm rooms, though. They're where most students stay, with two people sharing a room, except for a few exceptions.\n\nNow, about the people. My school is all about diversity, and you can really see that in my neighbourhood. There are folks from all walks of life, all ages, all backgrounds. The staff usually live in the houses, the new students in the dorm rooms, and the older ones in the apartments.\n\nTalking about all the different people here would take forever, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is its own little world, it has everything you need. There are tons of places to eat, just like in any neighbourhood, plus the school's own stores for clothes and groceries.  \n\nAnd then there's the park, a place for everyone to hang out and relax. It's always clean and safe, thanks to all the people who live here.",
            "Hmm...moving here ten years ago was a big change. Like, I was heartbroken leaving Riverdale and my friends. It felt like I was ripped away from everything familiar. I cried a lot, missing them terribly.  But my parents, they wanted the best for me and my little sister, you know? So, we moved to Stockbridge, hoping for better schools, a better life,  away from what they called \"ghetto.\" It took a while to adjust, to make new friends, even some new rivals. Truth be told, I never really got to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a little while. They were like family, though, always there to make things brighter. I remember when my mom, dad, and sister went to Mr. Glen's wedding - they got remarried! It was such a blast, dancing the night away. I even caught the little white strap off his wife's leg!  Sadly, I missed the bouquet. I really enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, though. Hope she's doing great!\n\nThis neighborhood is like a giant maze, but now I have a GPS, so I can explore more. I've only been to a few places, mainly where I hang out with my buddies, Kason and Curtis. We used to be video game addicts! We just lived life to the fullest, you know? Sometimes I'd head to the park, just to be surrounded by nature. It calms me down, gives me a sense of peace. I even bring sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and sometimes my bokken, just for fun.\n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court too, even though I haven't touched a racket or a ball in ages. It's nice to have them around, just in case I feel like playing again. My dad and Mr. Graves taught me how to play tennis with my best friend. We had so much fun, even though they pushed us hard! Looking back,  there are so many fun memories in this neighborhood, and I know there are even more amazing times waiting for me.",
            "Oh my gosh, living near my college is such a sweet deal!  My neighbourhood is like a little haven, mostly filled with apartment buildings, but sprinkled with a few cute little restaurants and bars that are totally wallet-friendly.  There's this one bar that just got a makeover and now it's a bit pricier, but hey, it's not like it's terrible.  The people here are mostly college students or people who are just starting out, so it's got that whole laid-back vibe.  And speaking of laid-back, there are tons of little kids running around because there's an elementary school nearby.  \n\nMy neighbours?  Well, let's just say I'm perfectly happy keeping things cordial from a distance. They're a bit ...enthusiastic about their herbal relaxation methods, which is kinda funny because the building management put this giant air freshener right outside their door!  It's like they're trying to mask the aroma, but it's more embarrassing for them, you know?\n\nMost of the buildings around here are a bit vintage, but a lot of them have been spruced up on the inside.  Down the street, there's a bunch of brand new apartments, but those are a total no-go for me.  They look cheap and flimsy, and the rent is sky-high!  It's like they're taking advantage of the fact that they're near campus, but whatever.\n\nThere's this amazing little hole-in-the-wall restaurant just a hop, skip, and a jump away. They serve everything on paper plates and most of it is microwaved, but it's so cheap and tasty!  Right across from that is a gas station, which I heard is a nightmare to work at. \n\nBut the best part is that last summer, the city finally decided to give our street a makeover!  They put in a brand new sidewalk, tons of grass, and now it's actually kind of pretty.  My apartment building is totally tucked away behind a bunch of trees, although they did have to chop down a few.  There's a whole line of trees behind my complex, and then another set of apartments on 43rd Street.  That street isn't as charming as mine.  The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings look a little rough around the edges, and there are a lot of trees, probably to hide the less glamorous parts.\n\nHonestly, there's been a bit of trouble around here, mostly at another apartment complex on 43rd Street.  But hey, I can't blame them completely.  There are some apartments across from me that have their share of issues too.\n\nBut you know what? I still love where I live. It's affordable, I'm close to everything, and best of all, the university is right around the corner!  I can walk there or hop on a bus, and there are buses that take me downtown and to the store too.",
            "My neighborhood feels like stepping back in time. It's a collection of yellow duplexes on a little cul-de-sac, spaced out so they look like single houses. Each one has a white porch and a green metal roof, making them all look quite charming. Almost everyone here knows each other, and we often gather at the end of one of the driveways to chat while the kids play. It's so refreshing to find this sense of community in our crazy, technology-driven world.  \n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees, under skies painted with blue and fluffy white clouds. It's a picture-perfect setting, but lately, we've been getting tornado warnings. Last night, we even heard the sirens, and I found myself scrambling for shelter in my bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and a few pillows. My big dog, on the other hand, stayed in the living room, barking nervously at the strange sounds.  \n\nThe hail that fell during the storm was so loud, it sounded like it was raining rocks. The roads steamed after the storm because the temperature dropped so quickly from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes! The hail melted on the hot pavement as soon as it hit. As the storm cleared, the sun peeked out and a double rainbow arched across the sky. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my friends and family – everyone was amazed.\n\nThe neighborhood stayed quiet for a while, then people slowly started to trickle back home. Soon, it was back to normal – moms and kids outside, dinner cooking on the stove. Life feels so friendly here. I recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, and I adore the southern accents.\n\nWe all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, though the insides are different. Some are surprisingly small, which seems a bit odd.\n\nI love taking walks in the huge field behind our homes, down to the pond (though it's not meant for swimming). I've seen deer there and in the mornings, I can hear the biggest bullfrog singing his heart out. It's just a wonderful place to live, only forty minutes from Charlotte. Every morning, we wake up to the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It feels like living in a small, close-knit village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm whose braying in the evening lets us know he's around. I feel so lucky to have found this little slice of paradise.",
            "Hmm, so I moved into this area right when I was starting eighth grade. Making new friends was a tough one at first, but then I got close to a couple of guys - one lives just two houses down, and the other one's on my street. They're not around anymore, but those memories, they linger. It's funny how the same faces have stayed put all these years. My neighborhood, it's like any other American suburb, you know? All those two-story houses, and every time the weather's nice, the sound of kids playing outside fills the air. It's usually pretty quiet though, except for the weekends.\n\nNever had any trouble with the folks around here. It's like, leave you alone unless you need something, which is nice. I've ordered a ton of stuff online, and not once has anything gone missing from my porch. Yeah, I trust these neighbors.\n\nThere's this park just a stone's throw away, man, it's packed with memories. Played basketball, football, baseball there with the neighborhood crew back in the day.  Even had one of my worst memories there - got elbowed in the nose playing football, ouch! But hey, the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Now, when I go to the park, it's all about hanging with my cousins' kids. They're way younger, still into the swings and slides and stuff. Just thinking about going there gets them hyped up.\n\nThe park, it just takes me back, you know?\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a melting pot, really. You got every kind of food imaginable within a hop, skip, and a jump. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a mile radius. These days, though, everybody just orders in with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.\n\nThe usual suspects are the fast food joints, but you find those everywhere, right?  There's a ton of pizza places too.  And the stores, they got everything you could ever need. Dry cleaners on every corner, a Walgreens, a CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store - a Midwest staple. \n\nThere's even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling adventurous and want to whip up some homemade curry or grab some ready-made stuff.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with my neighborhood. Reading all these horror stories about other people's neighbors online and on the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Oh, my little town, Johnston... it's just a speck on the map of South Carolina, not fancy like some places, but it's got a heart of gold.  You see, everyone knows Johnston as the Peach Capital of the World, and let me tell you, they wear that title proudly.  Everywhere you go, it's either peach trees as far as the eye can see or cows grazing in the fields.  \n\nThe houses, well, they're mostly spread out like stars in the night sky.  Most of them are two stories tall, with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or those faded gray shingles.  They're not right on the road either, but kinda tucked back, giving them space to have their own little gardens or maybe even a place for the animals.  \n\nThe main part of town?  You can practically find everything there.  There’s a single stoplight, like the heart of it all, and around it are the shops.  Hungry? You've got options: Hong Kong, a cozy Chinese place run by a family, Fiesta for some Mexican flavors, or Gary's, a burger joint that's a hometown favorite.  Used to be a pizza place too, but it closed down a while back, leaving a bit of a hole in the heart of town.\n\nThere's Maxwell and Halford Drug, the only pharmacy around, and they're famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  Then there's IGA, the grocery store.  It's a little fancy and pricey, so most folks just pop in for a few things and head to Batesburg-Leesville for the big grocery haul.  But let me tell you, the people love Dollar General!  It's got everything you need, and it's always buzzing with activity.\n\nOh, and there's Possibilities Furniture & More, owned by a sweet lady who knows everyone.  They've been around forever, even have their own movers! Right next to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where you can pamper your furry friends with baths, haircuts, and even daycare.  \n\nThe doctor and the vet are a bit away from the main drag, but they're both good folks who take care of everyone in town.  There’s Johnston Elementary School, but after fifth grade, the kids have to go to the next town for middle and high school.  We don't have any parks, but they're working on a little spot for families to enjoy.\n\nIt's a quiet town, not much to do, no movie theaters or fancy restaurants.  You blink, and you might miss it!  But it's got a special charm, a place where folks look out for each other.",
            "My ears first caught wind of this place  while I was lost in a podcast about missing folks. It was a bit of a shock, to be honest.  Apartments around here were going for over a thousand a month, and I'd never heard a peep about this story, not even from my friends. Maybe it's the struggle, you know? I know some of my friends end their days with tears, things are tight. Everything's expensive, but we've learned to be clever with our money over the years. You start to get a fondness for that dusty smell of flea market treasures and clothes that have seen better days. You just don't smell as much as you used to when you were younger. You might pick up a habit like smoking, or maybe it's just that you're used to the way things are. But that flea market feeling always lingers. The smell of grown-up life is dusty magazines piled on a dusty piano, clinging to the leather and staying even after you wash it.\n\nAround here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and even a curio shop. Downtown is a bustling place, cars and people jam the streets every morning, but you wouldn't hear a thing of it inside those shops. No matter how many people or cars whiz by, the stores are quiet sanctuaries.\n\nIt's a beautiful place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more of these kinds of places popping up. Cars and people keep flooding the city. It's a growing city, they say. With one of the biggest online empires for shopping and delivery calling it home, it still has those growing pains. It reminds me of New York, with everyone focused on their own goals and not really asking much from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and no one bats an eye. It's not like back in the South, where a little concern means you care deeply. People here don't pry into your life. You can keep your walls up as long as you want, and the city just rolls on like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on.\n\nIn a way, we have less of an apartment building of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other out when we can. I feel lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them their mail and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in this massive, impersonal, modern sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't totally messed up my life.",
            "My place is in one of those neighborhoods that, well, they're all pretty much the same, you know? It's just like cookie-cutter suburbia, with everyone following the same rules.  The homeowners' association, they're really big here, and it shows.  Every house looks the same - neat and tidy, with a little patch of lawn, some pebbles, and a pretty short driveway. There are a few trees sprinkled around, and every house has a two-car garage. The streets are always freshly paved, no potholes or anything like that, which is good because you see a lot of cars going around. \n\nMost houses are single story, but sometimes you'll find a two-story one.  The mailboxes are different here, too. We don't have individual ones in front of each house like you'd expect.  It's more like an apartment building, with a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street.  Everyone has a key to their own box, and there are even two big lockers for packages.  The HOA is all about uniformity, you see. My street is on the edge of the city, so it's kind of a mix between suburbia and the country. We have a lot of space here, which is nice. There are community pools that everyone can use, they're always clean and gated. And there are walking trails where you can take your dog or just go for a walk.\n\nMost of the people here are retired folks, and it's a really safe place. Everyone knows each other and looks out for each other. There are a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in, too. The city itself is pretty big, but it still has that small-town feel. We have most of the things you need, like a mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to anything really interesting, but once you get there, there are plenty of stores to choose from.  You can find everything from fancy organic grocery stores to bargain stores with just a few things and barely any staff. Overall, my neighborhood is pretty nice. It's safe, well-kept, and pretty typical. We have some good things, like pools and walking trails. And while we're not right next to any big shopping centers, it's a quick drive to get to them.",
            "My heart belongs to this little town, nestled just outside the bustling city.  Life here, on the east side, is a bit simpler, a little slower.  It's what some might call \"working class,\"  the houses aren't fancy, but they're filled with warm hearts and friendly faces.  You see, my neighbors are the kind who greet you with a smile and a wave, making you feel like you belong.  \n\nSure, there have been tough times, whispers of trouble that make their way into our quiet streets.  A couple of times, the news brought stories of violence, shootings, even a tragedy where a young man lost his life right outside a bar.  It was a stark reminder that even in this peaceful haven, shadows can creep in.  Happily, our family has been spared, our home a safe haven, though we've had our share of porch pirates.  \n\nBut this town, like so many others, has been grappling with a heavy burden - the grip of the opioid epidemic.  It's a dark cloud that hangs over us, stealing dreams and leaving families shattered.  But even in this darkness, there's a flicker of hope.  We've got folks here who care, who are fighting back.  There are places offering help to those struggling with addiction, training programs to equip families with the tools to face this challenge.\n\nNow, let me tell you about the heart of this town, my son's school.  It's a beacon of light, filled with dedicated teachers and staff who truly love and support every child.  My son, who has his own unique needs, thrives there.  He's never felt excluded, never encountered unkindness.  It's a testament to the kindness and inclusivity that permeates the school.  And the parents?  They're a force to be reckoned with!  The PTO is constantly buzzing with activity, organizing events that bring families together and celebrate learning.  The school provides free meals for every child, ensuring no hungry tummy goes unnoticed.  It's a place where every child feels valued, no matter their background or circumstances.\n\nOur town has its share of cosmetic flaws, though.  The city has done a fantastic job sprucing up the downtown area and the west side, where all the shops and restaurants are.  But on the east side, where I call home, things haven't seen the same attention.  It's a bit of a sore spot for us, a reminder that sometimes, progress isn't evenly distributed.\n\nBut despite these imperfections, this town is my home.  It's a place with a good heart, a place where people care for one another.  It's where my roots run deep, where our family has built a life.  And for all its challenges, I wouldn't trade it for anything.",
            "My neighborhood, it's like a tapestry woven with stories.  Sitting high on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of times gone by. I live in a seven-story apartment building, right across from an old theater, its faded grandeur a constant reminder of a bygone era. Just down the street, tucked away on The Hill, is this little bar with arcade games - a magnet for all sorts of folks, especially on warm summer nights.  You see lines snaking around the block, especially in June and July,  waiting to step into that lively space. A few blocks up, there's a park, a big one for this part of town.  Surrounding it, there's concrete, with these tall stairs built right into the walls. Come winter, when the rain comes down in sheets, you'll see tents lining the sidewalk and those wide steps.  Homeless folks, they huddle together, nestled in the heart of the city, not out in the harsh wilderness. It's a way to stay warm, and being close to the city center means they're within reach of the nearest place they can bathe and shower. \n\nBut what I truly cherish about my city isn't the historic buildings, the proud structures that climb the hills towards the ocean, though they are pretty spectacular.  It's the people, their resilience and spirit that make this place so special. You see, Hilltop used to be notorious, the most dangerous neighborhood on the West Coast. Thirty years later, stories still linger, tales of federal agents and the DEA trying to clean up the streets.  The people here, they carry those stories, pass them down through generations.  \n\nEven though Hilltop is still considered rough around the edges, they work hard to keep it clean, to keep it theirs. They care. There's this old saying, that white folks shouldn't walk around after dark, a warning that echoes the past, tinged with a bitterness that comes from prejudice. Perhaps it's because I have a shade of darkness that lets me blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees a bit of their own story reflected in me, someone who understands those lingering reminders of racism and fear that haunt our nation, even in a city that prides itself on being a melting pot. \n\nWhatever it is, I know this: no matter where I wander, Hilltop is home.  I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where the laundromat owner stays open a few extra minutes so I can charge my phone when caught in a downpour. It's a place where, on a bleak night, I can huddle against a store front, feeling invisible, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me a five dollar bill, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "My heart belongs to Rural America, specifically a little town in Michigan where fields of green stretch as far as the eye can see, giving way to charming tourist spots. We don't have those big city things like malls, Wal-mart, or even an Applebee's. If you need something, you gotta hop in the car and drive. But let me tell you, even without all that, I live in one of the most beautiful places on Earth, surrounded by shimmering water. My town, it's practically an island.  Lake Michigan graces one side, and Lake Charlevoix the other. Every turn brings you to a beach where you can dangle your feet in the cool waves.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a postcard of small-town living. Houses aren't crammed together like sardines. No cookie-cutter homes here. They're older, some with fresh coats of paint and modern touches, others keeping their original charm. Most have full basements, visible from the street, and many sport that classic aluminum siding. Houses come in every color imaginable – a rainbow parade right down my street!\n\nMost have yards, too, bursting with life. Trampolines bounce, playsets swing, and kids run wild. Gardens bloom, fences enclose families' furry friends, and the air hums with the sounds of life. It's a neighborhood of hard-working folks, raising families and building lives. On any given day, you'll see kids zipping around on bikes and scooters, dogs getting their walk on, and neighbors exchanging smiles and waves.\n\nThe lawns are always neat and tidy – no piles of leaves, just green grass neatly trimmed. Plants and bushes are pruned and cared for, adding splashes of color to the landscape. It's not a neighborhood that screams \"wealth\" or \"luxury,\" but it whispers \"welcome home.\" It's a place where you feel safe, where kids can play freely, and where neighbors look out for each other.\n\nYou can walk to the sheriff’s department and the jail, the health department just a hop, skip, and a jump away. The recycling center is down the road, serving folks from all over town.  The smell of freshly cut grass blends with the sounds of baseball games and the roar of small planes taking off and landing at the nearby airport.  Ice cream calls from the local shop, and a short bike ride takes you to the park, where laughter and joy echo through the air.\n\nThis is a place where life slows down, where you can breathe easy and build a future you're proud of. It's a place where you can truly belong."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood, nestled within a big city, is a whirlwind of contrasts. It's like a puzzle where houses and businesses are scattered about, sometimes randomly, sometimes with a sort of inner logic.  You've got your typical shops and restaurants, the kind you'd find anywhere, alongside fancy offices and bustling malls.  There's always something new to discover, a restaurant to try, a boutique to explore. Big brands rub shoulders with little independent shops, each adding their own flavor to the mix.  These little shops, especially, seem to be popping up everywhere, lining the streets like hidden gems, bringing a touch of life to what would otherwise be quiet corners. And speaking of life, there are parks scattered around too, filled with families enjoying time together.\n\nThe people are as diverse as the shops, a melting pot of cultures and backgrounds. I live in a corner where you'll find a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, a group of Orthodox Jews, and families who fled the former Soviet Union, all finding their place.  Venture a little further, and you'll find pockets of other communities – Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia – each a world unto itself. It's amazing, but these little worlds can be miles apart, even though they're just a short drive away.  \n\nDriving in this city can be a nightmare, though. Ten miles can easily turn into a two-hour journey during rush hour.  Traffic is legendary here, and parking is a mythical creature you rarely encounter.  Ironically, they keep building more apartments, even though everyone seems to be complaining about the traffic and overcrowding.\n\nBut there are different kinds of homes too, not just towering apartment blocks.  There are houses of all shapes and sizes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings. Even within my own neighborhood, you'll find a mix of everything, offering a range of choices.\n\nThe people are just as diverse as the housing.  There are all ages, backgrounds, and stories. Truthfully, I don't know most of my neighbors. We're not a close-knit community like we used to be.  I remember back when I was a kid, playing outside with my next-door neighbors and friends, but those days seem long gone.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a storybook kinda place, you know?  Most of the houses are like those picture-perfect single-family homes, but some of them have been split into two, still stuck together somehow. It's like they're trying to hold onto something, even though things are changing. My place has this little patch of grass out front and a tiny driveway. It's like a snapshot of a time when living in the suburbs was the dream, the American dream.  Back then, it felt like everyone was reaching for it, but now it seems like maybe the dream is slipping away.  But my neighborhood, this little pocket of houses, it still whispers that dream, reminding us that maybe, just maybe, it's still out there somewhere. \n\nYou can see it in the little things.  People aren't as hopeful as they used to be. The yards aren't as perfect, but there's still a car or two in every driveway. The kids are out playing like the whole world is right there in front of them. The old school, the one that's been standing for almost ninety years, it's still there, still holding onto that promise of the future.  It brings back memories for the old folks, and hope for the young ones. The churches are kinda lonely, most of them empty, but the basketball courts are always packed.  \n\nEvery house looks different, but they all feel the same, you know? There's this big supermarket, Super \"A,\" owned by this big Yemeni family, the only Arab family around here.  Mostly everyone else is African American, been here for generations. They know each other's stories, the way it used to be.  There used to be a karate school, but when those Karate Kid movies stopped coming out, kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, I guess because everyone needs a little something to make life a little easier. There's this little movie theater, too, showing old movies for cheap. Young folks don't go there, they want all the new releases, but the older folks love it.  It's a night out without the kids, you know?  \n\nThere's a big highway that runs right through town, but the exit and entrance are in the next town over.  We tried to get an exit here, but the young folks wanted it and the old folks said it would ruin the town.  They talked the city council into saying no, and now we're stuck.\n\nThey're building a new high school, and we're trying to figure out what mascot to have. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be perfect.  It's the only thing that makes sense in this town.",
            "You might just breeze past it, thinkin' it's nothin' special. It's tucked away behind shops, not the kind of place you'd guess folks actually live. At least, not the kind of place most folks would *want* to live.  But if you sneak past that old, dusty Whole Foods and peek behind those hotels that only get busy a few times a year, you'll find a whole world buzzin' with life.\n\nRight there, nestled along the road like a set of Russian dolls someone took apart and laid out flat, are a bunch of apartment complexes.  First up, you've got those ones that have been splashed all over the news -  a bit shady, let's just say. But keep on walkin', past those, and you'll hit a whole different scene.\n\nAcross the street from those, you've got a community college branch.  Picture this: sleepy students shufflin' in at 7 in the mornin', coffee in hand, yawning their way into their day.  The iron gates creak open for them one by one, while folks rushin' to work glare and mutter about 'em holdin' up traffic.\n\nThe road splits off, leadin' to another residential street. On one side, a park where kids are cartwheelin' and playin', bees buzzin' around the flowers.  Across the street, a rehab center for folks who've had a tumble -  bright porch furniture and a fan churnin' the summer air. Old folks walk their dogs, scowl at the teens on skateboards, and nod at the girls chattin' by the swings.\n\nThen, you've got a strip mall: sushi, a swimming supply store, a nail salon - all in one spot!  Get a mani, fill your pool, and grab some hibachi chicken, all at once. The kind of place where you can see teens from the park stuffin' their faces with frozen yogurt, tryin' to look cool while they vape.\n\nThis whole neighborhood, it's like a piece of America frozen in time, quiet and familiar, nothin' ever really changes.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past fields of corn that stretched as far as the eye could see. I knew she'd be surprised by how open and empty it all looked. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a hop, skip, and a jump away, so this vast landscape was a whole new world for her. Overwhelmed by all the corn, I told her stories about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe continued down the two-lane road, passing a quarry filled with water. Just past it, nestled among the cornfields, was the small development where I lived. Most of the houses were built from brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that everyone took pride in keeping beautiful. In the spring, colorful flowers bloomed everywhere, surrounded by the midwestern trees that changed colors with each passing season. In the driveways, gleaming Mercedes-Benz cars, the kind that had just come back from a good wash, seemed to sparkle in the midday sun.\n\nAs we drove towards my grey stucco house, I noticed my Korean neighbor outside, always smiling and waving. He spent his days tending to his lawn, and his cheerful singing could be heard faintly over the hum of his lawnmower. Everyone in the neighborhood found it amusing, but he was a genuine and wonderful person with a fascinating history. He was getting older, though, and had lost some of his sharp wit, but he still had a presence about him. In his younger days, he was a doctor, and now he blended in with the grass and his trusty John Deere Zero-Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reached my house. In the side yard, geese waddled around, chased by our playful terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flowed into the quarry, where you could hear the croaking of bullfrogs, the gurgling stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge, there was a peaceful oasis filled with trees, herbs, and wildflowers that grew wild. That's where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, \"hunting\" animals (mostly just chasing them), and always finding someone from the neighborhood to play with.\n\nOur winters could be incredibly harsh, but there was something so beautiful about them. The yard turned from a lush green into a wide-open wilderness. The trees that had once been covered in vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers became bare skeletons of bark. When it snowed, which it did occasionally, a magical winter wonderland appeared overnight. The backyard was filled with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. We fought a lot as kids, and during the winter, snowballs became our weapons of choice. We built huge igloo-like forts to protect our arsenal of branches, turning our backyard into a winter wonderland where we played pretend, oblivious to the world around us. We were just kids, carefree and full of life.",
            "Alright, so you wanna know about Portland, Oregon? Firstly, you gotta get a grasp on this whole \"weird\" thing. It's practically the city's motto, scrawled on the side of a building that somehow manages to be all things at once – a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, even a strip club, walking a fine line with the law most of the time.  \n\nSome folks see it as a throwback to the 90s and early 2000s, back when Portland was a hidden gem, a little rough around the edges, and where a whole bunch of unique personalities thrived. Others see it as an invitation – come on down to Portland, where being a little different isn't just accepted, it's celebrated. Even with all the fancy Californians moving in and the construction cranes building condos for them, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.\n\nNow, \"weird\" doesn't mean everything goes. It's not like we're all hippies living in communes, although there are definitely some of those. We still have our fancy coffee shops, our yoga studios, and our suits-wearing corporate folks. Maybe \"weird\" just means we take everything a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. Houses here are painted in all sorts of crazy colors, gardens burst with flowers and herbs and vegetables, and in the summertime, there are these magical things called \"free boxes\" lining the sidewalks. They're usually cardboard boxes filled with stuff people are getting rid of, but sometimes it's plastic bags or whatever. You never know what treasures you might find inside – clothes, books, maybe even a vintage record player. It's like a treasure hunt every time you walk down the street.\n\nThat's what Portland is all about, at least to me. It's about embracing the unexpected, the quirky, the downright strange. But hey, I'm just one weird person in a city full of them. Some of my neighbors wouldn't be caught dead digging through a free box. They're off doing goat yoga or cheering on the Timbers, the city's soccer team.  \n\nPortland is a city where people chase their dreams, even if those dreams involve spending a little too much time at the bar.  We've got our problems, like any other city. Drug use and homelessness are real issues here, fueled by a combination of mental health struggles and the gloomy weather. But we're trying, even if we're not always sure what the right answer is. We're a city of contradictions, full of love and hate, acceptance and judgment, wonder and despair. \n\nMaybe that's what makes Portland so uniquely weird – it's not afraid to be real, even when real is messy.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, you know?  Like silent guardians to the north, watching the sun rise and set every single day. It doesn't matter if I get caught up in work or life, if I forget about them for a while, they're still there. Strong, steady, not bothered by all the craziness down here. But on days when I'm feeling totally stressed, like my soul is about to burst, they call to me. And when I look at them, they just...calm me. They give me strength to keep going, one step at a time.\n\nI remember when I first moved here for college, it was those north mountains that really stole my heart.  Sure, the campus itself has its own beauty - the buildings, the ponds, the trees - they all hold a special place in my heart. But those mountains, they rule. \n\nThis town, it's got its own charm too. There are these awesome cafes, perfect for late-night studying fueled by caffeine. Just a short walk or bus ride, and you're in the downtown area, feeling all that old-world magic with the colorful, worn-down bricks lining the restaurants and offices. It's like a mini city, buzzing with energy, just like its bigger neighbor. But then, just a few blocks away,  you're back in that peaceful small-town vibe, past the library and everything.  It's this mix of energy and serenity that makes this place so special, like it's just waiting to be explored.  And with all that, it's easy to make memories - good ones, bad ones, all of them. Walking past those rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, the rush of excitement running through the busy downtown to catch a movie, thanks to a free ticket from the university...those are the kind of moments you hold onto. But there are sad ones too, because, well, life happens.\n\nThose ponds, especially, they're good for reflection, for quiet tears at 2 am when you're questioning everything.  I've had my fair share of those. Watching the turtles and ducks and bugs go about their lives, each with their own purpose, made me wonder about my own place in this big, confusing world. So I walked past the pond, past the park, past the houses that screamed \"suburbia,\" until I found myself on a main street. The sun was shining, bathing the palm trees in gold, and as I looked up at the sky, I realized I was walking north.  There they were, just as they'd always been. Those majestic mountains, reaching for the sky, more powerful than any building in sight. And in that moment, without saying a word, they reminded me to keep going.",
            "Oh my goodness, if you're thinking about popping into Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, don't you worry about finding it!  Getting around is a breeze with all the public transportation, it's like the lifeblood of New York City. You'll definitely feel like you're right in the heart of the Big Apple, even though Bensonhurst has its own special charm. Brace yourself for a vibrant mix of Asian cultures! Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurst has become a real melting pot, with a whole wave of Asian folks settling in.   Just take a stroll down the block, and you'll see an Asian-owned store practically every step of the way. Supermarkets and laundromats seem to be the stars of the show, and let me tell you, they're a hit with the locals! The food in those supermarkets is absolutely divine, the prices are super friendly, and it's just so darn convenient to have them right around the corner.  \n\nSpeaking of convenient, there are four Asian supermarkets within a stone's throw of where I am! Talk about making grocery shopping a snap!  Now, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave. It's a beautiful tapestry of cultures, with immigrants and their families making this place their home.  While most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, there's a brand-new park nearby that's a real gem. It's got everything you could imagine: basketball courts, soccer and baseball fields, handball courts, swings, a playground for the little ones, and even a water fountain to keep them cool in the summer heat. It's a true melting pot of kids,  laughing and playing together.\n\nYou won't find many towering corporate buildings here.  Most of the buildings are co-ops or condos, but the majority of folks live in cozy two-family houses.  The people are generally lovely, but a tad noisy, let me tell you! It's like a constant soundtrack of cars blasting music and revving up their engines, even in the morning!  If you're planning a nighttime visit, just keep your wits about you. Bensonhurst is a safe neighborhood, but you know how it is in a big city - sometimes people can be unpredictable. There have been a few instances of petty crime, like package theft. And let's not forget about the dog waste! It seems like every time I step out, there's a little \"present\" waiting for me on the sidewalk.  Keep your eyes peeled and your shoes clean, my friend!",
            "My neighborhood is a bit of a peculiar place. The streets are steep, like a rolling hill, with my house perched at its peak. People jokingly call it the \"workout hill\" because runners love to test their stamina against its incline.  There aren't any sidewalks, so everyone walks on the road, which is a bit bumpy in places. Some of the power lines and telephone wires look like they've seen better days, constantly being patched up after storms whip through, pulling down branches and debris. \n\nEverywhere you look, towering evergreen trees stand sentinel. But the locals aren't too fond of them. They're always trying to chop them down because they obstruct the view of the shimmering ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill, with giant glass second stories that stretch towards the horizon, desperate to catch a glimpse of the bay.\n\nAt sunset, the water catches the fading light, turning the whole scene into a fiery display of orange hues. But the sky's usually shrouded in a thick haze, so those sun-drenched moments are few and far between. Most days are gloomy and damp, with moss creeping onto everything it can – roofs, cars, even railings. Once, I left my car parked in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick, green fuzz. It took ages to scrub it all off!\n\nKids are a rare sight around here. There's a school nearby, but most residents are older folks, enjoying their retirement. They seem to prefer the company of dogs, which roam freely, playing in yards or chasing each other down the street.  Be careful if you leave a door or window open – those dogs will sneak in without hesitation!\n\nRabbits are another common sight, hopping around and causing havoc in gardens. The gardeners despise them, but my cats adore them, practically hunting them out of existence.  We also have the usual assortment of birds: flitting sparrows, buzzing hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle, until the neighborhood crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but if you're willing to hike down to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can practically see the other side even through the mist.",
            "Life in our little corner of Tennessee is pretty laid back. We're right smack-dab in the middle of a quiet suburb, tucked between two state highways. You know, the kind of place where folks wave hello as they drive by.  Traffic can be a bit much sometimes, but it's nothing too crazy. Most folks here have been around forever,  so it feels like one big family.\n\nWe're a pretty typical family – me, my wife, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. We work from home, so we're always around, and the kids are always out and about, playing bike games and such.  We love to play outside, rain or shine. We even have a back deck where we fire up the grill. There's always that delicious smell of barbecue floating around, especially during the warmer months.  \n\nOur neighborhood is like a big green haven.  It used to be all woods, so there are still plenty of trees around, which means a whole lot of shade during the summer and a whole lot of leaves to rake in the fall.  I gotta admit, I kinda love the smell of burning leaves. It just screams, \"Fall is here!\"\n\nThese days, it feels like we're skipping right from summer to winter, though. We haven't had much of a true winter at all.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's come knocking. But when I'm working on my truck in the garage, with the doors open, I feel like I'm right in the heart of all the neighborhood action.\n\nHolidays are pretty quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving when everyone's got family visiting. Those are the days when the streets are filled with cars and there's a real sense of togetherness.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't trade this little slice of life for anything. If it weren't for the traffic from the highways, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighbourhood, it's smack dab in the middle of the high desert, you know, dirt as far as the eye can see. Unless you've actually lived here, it's hard to truly understand. You get used to seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you just know that person's dropping serious cash on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out, like you could practically spit from one to the next. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a ton of new houses popping up. This place is starting to feel more and more like a city every day, I guess that's what happens everywhere, right? Most folks here are really friendly, but like any place, you've got your good parts and your not-so-good parts. My neighborhood is pretty chill, surrounded by friendly old folks. The stores around here, they're mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want something fancier, you gotta drive. I don't see any Whole Foods or anything like that. \n\nThe jobs around here, if I had to guess, are mostly construction. I think it's because this city's still growing, there's so much open space left to build on. It kinda scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not looking to go back. \n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the desert itself is pretty special. \n\nThe high desert climate and the way the land looks have made for some pretty tough environments, and those environments are home to all kinds of cool creatures. People who live here should really try to learn about the animals that share their space so we can all get along. My family and I have gotten used to living with the wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside trying to catch some.  As for things to do, we've got some attractions. Victorville is a pretty good place for families to experience the desert life. It's a different kind of experience, for sure. If you can swing it, try to visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a ton of fun. \n\nYou can also head over to Wrightwood, nearby, to see the snow-covered mountains and take some lessons if you're feeling adventurous. If you're interested in the history and nature of the high desert, check out the Victor Valley Museum. They've got all sorts of cool stuff there: rocks, fossils, Native American artifacts, and things that tell the story of how Victorville grew up.",
            "Hmm...you know, if you asked me to describe my neighbourhood, it'd be a little different from what most folks would say. While they probably think of houses and backyards, my neighbourhood is more like a giant dorm. See, I live on campus, and my whole world revolves around the people in my dorm and the buildings around it. The campus itself kind of becomes my neighbourhood, even if it's a bit more spread out. But hey, even though it's unique, it still has those things you'd find in any other neighbourhood.\n\nLet's start with the \"houses,\" shall we? Now, my neighbourhood has these three types of places to live: apartments, actual houses, and dorm rooms. First, there are the apartments, usually with 2 to 4 people sharing each room. Each floor has around 4 to 6 rooms, and the buildings are usually two stories high. So, you've got about 20 people living in each building.\n\nThen, there are the actual houses, scattered around the campus. These are for people who work at the school or maybe some alumni. They're usually 2 to 4 bedrooms and not as common as the apartments. The most common places to live are the dorm rooms, though. They're where most students stay, with two people sharing a room, except for a few exceptions.\n\nNow, about the people. My school is all about diversity, and you can really see that in my neighbourhood. There are folks from all walks of life, all ages, all backgrounds. The staff usually live in the houses, the new students in the dorm rooms, and the older ones in the apartments.\n\nTalking about all the different people here would take forever, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is its own little world, it has everything you need. There are tons of places to eat, just like in any neighbourhood, plus the school's own stores for clothes and groceries.  \n\nAnd then there's the park, a place for everyone to hang out and relax. It's always clean and safe, thanks to all the people who live here.",
            "Hmm...moving here ten years ago was a big change. Like, I was heartbroken leaving Riverdale and my friends. It felt like I was ripped away from everything familiar. I cried a lot, missing them terribly.  But my parents, they wanted the best for me and my little sister, you know? So, we moved to Stockbridge, hoping for better schools, a better life,  away from what they called \"ghetto.\" It took a while to adjust, to make new friends, even some new rivals. Truth be told, I never really got to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a little while. They were like family, though, always there to make things brighter. I remember when my mom, dad, and sister went to Mr. Glen's wedding - they got remarried! It was such a blast, dancing the night away. I even caught the little white strap off his wife's leg!  Sadly, I missed the bouquet. I really enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, though. Hope she's doing great!\n\nThis neighborhood is like a giant maze, but now I have a GPS, so I can explore more. I've only been to a few places, mainly where I hang out with my buddies, Kason and Curtis. We used to be video game addicts! We just lived life to the fullest, you know? Sometimes I'd head to the park, just to be surrounded by nature. It calms me down, gives me a sense of peace. I even bring sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and sometimes my bokken, just for fun.\n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court too, even though I haven't touched a racket or a ball in ages. It's nice to have them around, just in case I feel like playing again. My dad and Mr. Graves taught me how to play tennis with my best friend. We had so much fun, even though they pushed us hard! Looking back,  there are so many fun memories in this neighborhood, and I know there are even more amazing times waiting for me.",
            "Oh my gosh, living near my college is such a sweet deal!  My neighbourhood is like a little haven, mostly filled with apartment buildings, but sprinkled with a few cute little restaurants and bars that are totally wallet-friendly.  There's this one bar that just got a makeover and now it's a bit pricier, but hey, it's not like it's terrible.  The people here are mostly college students or people who are just starting out, so it's got that whole laid-back vibe.  And speaking of laid-back, there are tons of little kids running around because there's an elementary school nearby.  \n\nMy neighbours?  Well, let's just say I'm perfectly happy keeping things cordial from a distance. They're a bit ...enthusiastic about their herbal relaxation methods, which is kinda funny because the building management put this giant air freshener right outside their door!  It's like they're trying to mask the aroma, but it's more embarrassing for them, you know?\n\nMost of the buildings around here are a bit vintage, but a lot of them have been spruced up on the inside.  Down the street, there's a bunch of brand new apartments, but those are a total no-go for me.  They look cheap and flimsy, and the rent is sky-high!  It's like they're taking advantage of the fact that they're near campus, but whatever.\n\nThere's this amazing little hole-in-the-wall restaurant just a hop, skip, and a jump away. They serve everything on paper plates and most of it is microwaved, but it's so cheap and tasty!  Right across from that is a gas station, which I heard is a nightmare to work at. \n\nBut the best part is that last summer, the city finally decided to give our street a makeover!  They put in a brand new sidewalk, tons of grass, and now it's actually kind of pretty.  My apartment building is totally tucked away behind a bunch of trees, although they did have to chop down a few.  There's a whole line of trees behind my complex, and then another set of apartments on 43rd Street.  That street isn't as charming as mine.  The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings look a little rough around the edges, and there are a lot of trees, probably to hide the less glamorous parts.\n\nHonestly, there's been a bit of trouble around here, mostly at another apartment complex on 43rd Street.  But hey, I can't blame them completely.  There are some apartments across from me that have their share of issues too.\n\nBut you know what? I still love where I live. It's affordable, I'm close to everything, and best of all, the university is right around the corner!  I can walk there or hop on a bus, and there are buses that take me downtown and to the store too.",
            "My neighborhood feels like stepping back in time. It's a collection of yellow duplexes on a little cul-de-sac, spaced out so they look like single houses. Each one has a white porch and a green metal roof, making them all look quite charming. Almost everyone here knows each other, and we often gather at the end of one of the driveways to chat while the kids play. It's so refreshing to find this sense of community in our crazy, technology-driven world.  \n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees, under skies painted with blue and fluffy white clouds. It's a picture-perfect setting, but lately, we've been getting tornado warnings. Last night, we even heard the sirens, and I found myself scrambling for shelter in my bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and a few pillows. My big dog, on the other hand, stayed in the living room, barking nervously at the strange sounds.  \n\nThe hail that fell during the storm was so loud, it sounded like it was raining rocks. The roads steamed after the storm because the temperature dropped so quickly from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes! The hail melted on the hot pavement as soon as it hit. As the storm cleared, the sun peeked out and a double rainbow arched across the sky. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my friends and family – everyone was amazed.\n\nThe neighborhood stayed quiet for a while, then people slowly started to trickle back home. Soon, it was back to normal – moms and kids outside, dinner cooking on the stove. Life feels so friendly here. I recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, and I adore the southern accents.\n\nWe all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, though the insides are different. Some are surprisingly small, which seems a bit odd.\n\nI love taking walks in the huge field behind our homes, down to the pond (though it's not meant for swimming). I've seen deer there and in the mornings, I can hear the biggest bullfrog singing his heart out. It's just a wonderful place to live, only forty minutes from Charlotte. Every morning, we wake up to the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It feels like living in a small, close-knit village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm whose braying in the evening lets us know he's around. I feel so lucky to have found this little slice of paradise.",
            "Hmm, so I moved into this area right when I was starting eighth grade. Making new friends was a tough one at first, but then I got close to a couple of guys - one lives just two houses down, and the other one's on my street. They're not around anymore, but those memories, they linger. It's funny how the same faces have stayed put all these years. My neighborhood, it's like any other American suburb, you know? All those two-story houses, and every time the weather's nice, the sound of kids playing outside fills the air. It's usually pretty quiet though, except for the weekends.\n\nNever had any trouble with the folks around here. It's like, leave you alone unless you need something, which is nice. I've ordered a ton of stuff online, and not once has anything gone missing from my porch. Yeah, I trust these neighbors.\n\nThere's this park just a stone's throw away, man, it's packed with memories. Played basketball, football, baseball there with the neighborhood crew back in the day.  Even had one of my worst memories there - got elbowed in the nose playing football, ouch! But hey, the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Now, when I go to the park, it's all about hanging with my cousins' kids. They're way younger, still into the swings and slides and stuff. Just thinking about going there gets them hyped up.\n\nThe park, it just takes me back, you know?\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a melting pot, really. You got every kind of food imaginable within a hop, skip, and a jump. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a mile radius. These days, though, everybody just orders in with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.\n\nThe usual suspects are the fast food joints, but you find those everywhere, right?  There's a ton of pizza places too.  And the stores, they got everything you could ever need. Dry cleaners on every corner, a Walgreens, a CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store - a Midwest staple. \n\nThere's even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling adventurous and want to whip up some homemade curry or grab some ready-made stuff.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with my neighborhood. Reading all these horror stories about other people's neighbors online and on the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Oh, my little town, Johnston... it's just a speck on the map of South Carolina, not fancy like some places, but it's got a heart of gold.  You see, everyone knows Johnston as the Peach Capital of the World, and let me tell you, they wear that title proudly.  Everywhere you go, it's either peach trees as far as the eye can see or cows grazing in the fields.  \n\nThe houses, well, they're mostly spread out like stars in the night sky.  Most of them are two stories tall, with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or those faded gray shingles.  They're not right on the road either, but kinda tucked back, giving them space to have their own little gardens or maybe even a place for the animals.  \n\nThe main part of town?  You can practically find everything there.  There’s a single stoplight, like the heart of it all, and around it are the shops.  Hungry? You've got options: Hong Kong, a cozy Chinese place run by a family, Fiesta for some Mexican flavors, or Gary's, a burger joint that's a hometown favorite.  Used to be a pizza place too, but it closed down a while back, leaving a bit of a hole in the heart of town.\n\nThere's Maxwell and Halford Drug, the only pharmacy around, and they're famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  Then there's IGA, the grocery store.  It's a little fancy and pricey, so most folks just pop in for a few things and head to Batesburg-Leesville for the big grocery haul.  But let me tell you, the people love Dollar General!  It's got everything you need, and it's always buzzing with activity.\n\nOh, and there's Possibilities Furniture & More, owned by a sweet lady who knows everyone.  They've been around forever, even have their own movers! Right next to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where you can pamper your furry friends with baths, haircuts, and even daycare.  \n\nThe doctor and the vet are a bit away from the main drag, but they're both good folks who take care of everyone in town.  There’s Johnston Elementary School, but after fifth grade, the kids have to go to the next town for middle and high school.  We don't have any parks, but they're working on a little spot for families to enjoy.\n\nIt's a quiet town, not much to do, no movie theaters or fancy restaurants.  You blink, and you might miss it!  But it's got a special charm, a place where folks look out for each other.",
            "My ears first caught wind of this place  while I was lost in a podcast about missing folks. It was a bit of a shock, to be honest.  Apartments around here were going for over a thousand a month, and I'd never heard a peep about this story, not even from my friends. Maybe it's the struggle, you know? I know some of my friends end their days with tears, things are tight. Everything's expensive, but we've learned to be clever with our money over the years. You start to get a fondness for that dusty smell of flea market treasures and clothes that have seen better days. You just don't smell as much as you used to when you were younger. You might pick up a habit like smoking, or maybe it's just that you're used to the way things are. But that flea market feeling always lingers. The smell of grown-up life is dusty magazines piled on a dusty piano, clinging to the leather and staying even after you wash it.\n\nAround here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and even a curio shop. Downtown is a bustling place, cars and people jam the streets every morning, but you wouldn't hear a thing of it inside those shops. No matter how many people or cars whiz by, the stores are quiet sanctuaries.\n\nIt's a beautiful place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more of these kinds of places popping up. Cars and people keep flooding the city. It's a growing city, they say. With one of the biggest online empires for shopping and delivery calling it home, it still has those growing pains. It reminds me of New York, with everyone focused on their own goals and not really asking much from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and no one bats an eye. It's not like back in the South, where a little concern means you care deeply. People here don't pry into your life. You can keep your walls up as long as you want, and the city just rolls on like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on.\n\nIn a way, we have less of an apartment building of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other out when we can. I feel lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them their mail and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in this massive, impersonal, modern sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't totally messed up my life.",
            "My place is in one of those neighborhoods that, well, they're all pretty much the same, you know? It's just like cookie-cutter suburbia, with everyone following the same rules.  The homeowners' association, they're really big here, and it shows.  Every house looks the same - neat and tidy, with a little patch of lawn, some pebbles, and a pretty short driveway. There are a few trees sprinkled around, and every house has a two-car garage. The streets are always freshly paved, no potholes or anything like that, which is good because you see a lot of cars going around. \n\nMost houses are single story, but sometimes you'll find a two-story one.  The mailboxes are different here, too. We don't have individual ones in front of each house like you'd expect.  It's more like an apartment building, with a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street.  Everyone has a key to their own box, and there are even two big lockers for packages.  The HOA is all about uniformity, you see. My street is on the edge of the city, so it's kind of a mix between suburbia and the country. We have a lot of space here, which is nice. There are community pools that everyone can use, they're always clean and gated. And there are walking trails where you can take your dog or just go for a walk.\n\nMost of the people here are retired folks, and it's a really safe place. Everyone knows each other and looks out for each other. There are a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in, too. The city itself is pretty big, but it still has that small-town feel. We have most of the things you need, like a mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to anything really interesting, but once you get there, there are plenty of stores to choose from.  You can find everything from fancy organic grocery stores to bargain stores with just a few things and barely any staff. Overall, my neighborhood is pretty nice. It's safe, well-kept, and pretty typical. We have some good things, like pools and walking trails. And while we're not right next to any big shopping centers, it's a quick drive to get to them.",
            "My heart belongs to this little town, nestled just outside the bustling city.  Life here, on the east side, is a bit simpler, a little slower.  It's what some might call \"working class,\"  the houses aren't fancy, but they're filled with warm hearts and friendly faces.  You see, my neighbors are the kind who greet you with a smile and a wave, making you feel like you belong.  \n\nSure, there have been tough times, whispers of trouble that make their way into our quiet streets.  A couple of times, the news brought stories of violence, shootings, even a tragedy where a young man lost his life right outside a bar.  It was a stark reminder that even in this peaceful haven, shadows can creep in.  Happily, our family has been spared, our home a safe haven, though we've had our share of porch pirates.  \n\nBut this town, like so many others, has been grappling with a heavy burden - the grip of the opioid epidemic.  It's a dark cloud that hangs over us, stealing dreams and leaving families shattered.  But even in this darkness, there's a flicker of hope.  We've got folks here who care, who are fighting back.  There are places offering help to those struggling with addiction, training programs to equip families with the tools to face this challenge.\n\nNow, let me tell you about the heart of this town, my son's school.  It's a beacon of light, filled with dedicated teachers and staff who truly love and support every child.  My son, who has his own unique needs, thrives there.  He's never felt excluded, never encountered unkindness.  It's a testament to the kindness and inclusivity that permeates the school.  And the parents?  They're a force to be reckoned with!  The PTO is constantly buzzing with activity, organizing events that bring families together and celebrate learning.  The school provides free meals for every child, ensuring no hungry tummy goes unnoticed.  It's a place where every child feels valued, no matter their background or circumstances.\n\nOur town has its share of cosmetic flaws, though.  The city has done a fantastic job sprucing up the downtown area and the west side, where all the shops and restaurants are.  But on the east side, where I call home, things haven't seen the same attention.  It's a bit of a sore spot for us, a reminder that sometimes, progress isn't evenly distributed.\n\nBut despite these imperfections, this town is my home.  It's a place with a good heart, a place where people care for one another.  It's where my roots run deep, where our family has built a life.  And for all its challenges, I wouldn't trade it for anything.",
            "My neighborhood, it's like a tapestry woven with stories.  Sitting high on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of times gone by. I live in a seven-story apartment building, right across from an old theater, its faded grandeur a constant reminder of a bygone era. Just down the street, tucked away on The Hill, is this little bar with arcade games - a magnet for all sorts of folks, especially on warm summer nights.  You see lines snaking around the block, especially in June and July,  waiting to step into that lively space. A few blocks up, there's a park, a big one for this part of town.  Surrounding it, there's concrete, with these tall stairs built right into the walls. Come winter, when the rain comes down in sheets, you'll see tents lining the sidewalk and those wide steps.  Homeless folks, they huddle together, nestled in the heart of the city, not out in the harsh wilderness. It's a way to stay warm, and being close to the city center means they're within reach of the nearest place they can bathe and shower. \n\nBut what I truly cherish about my city isn't the historic buildings, the proud structures that climb the hills towards the ocean, though they are pretty spectacular.  It's the people, their resilience and spirit that make this place so special. You see, Hilltop used to be notorious, the most dangerous neighborhood on the West Coast. Thirty years later, stories still linger, tales of federal agents and the DEA trying to clean up the streets.  The people here, they carry those stories, pass them down through generations.  \n\nEven though Hilltop is still considered rough around the edges, they work hard to keep it clean, to keep it theirs. They care. There's this old saying, that white folks shouldn't walk around after dark, a warning that echoes the past, tinged with a bitterness that comes from prejudice. Perhaps it's because I have a shade of darkness that lets me blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees a bit of their own story reflected in me, someone who understands those lingering reminders of racism and fear that haunt our nation, even in a city that prides itself on being a melting pot. \n\nWhatever it is, I know this: no matter where I wander, Hilltop is home.  I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where the laundromat owner stays open a few extra minutes so I can charge my phone when caught in a downpour. It's a place where, on a bleak night, I can huddle against a store front, feeling invisible, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me a five dollar bill, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "My heart belongs to Rural America, specifically a little town in Michigan where fields of green stretch as far as the eye can see, giving way to charming tourist spots. We don't have those big city things like malls, Wal-mart, or even an Applebee's. If you need something, you gotta hop in the car and drive. But let me tell you, even without all that, I live in one of the most beautiful places on Earth, surrounded by shimmering water. My town, it's practically an island.  Lake Michigan graces one side, and Lake Charlevoix the other. Every turn brings you to a beach where you can dangle your feet in the cool waves.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a postcard of small-town living. Houses aren't crammed together like sardines. No cookie-cutter homes here. They're older, some with fresh coats of paint and modern touches, others keeping their original charm. Most have full basements, visible from the street, and many sport that classic aluminum siding. Houses come in every color imaginable – a rainbow parade right down my street!\n\nMost have yards, too, bursting with life. Trampolines bounce, playsets swing, and kids run wild. Gardens bloom, fences enclose families' furry friends, and the air hums with the sounds of life. It's a neighborhood of hard-working folks, raising families and building lives. On any given day, you'll see kids zipping around on bikes and scooters, dogs getting their walk on, and neighbors exchanging smiles and waves.\n\nThe lawns are always neat and tidy – no piles of leaves, just green grass neatly trimmed. Plants and bushes are pruned and cared for, adding splashes of color to the landscape. It's not a neighborhood that screams \"wealth\" or \"luxury,\" but it whispers \"welcome home.\" It's a place where you feel safe, where kids can play freely, and where neighbors look out for each other.\n\nYou can walk to the sheriff’s department and the jail, the health department just a hop, skip, and a jump away. The recycling center is down the road, serving folks from all over town.  The smell of freshly cut grass blends with the sounds of baseball games and the roar of small planes taking off and landing at the nearby airport.  Ice cream calls from the local shop, and a short bike ride takes you to the park, where laughter and joy echo through the air.\n\nThis is a place where life slows down, where you can breathe easy and build a future you're proud of. It's a place where you can truly belong."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood, nestled within a big city, is a whirlwind of contrasts. It's like a puzzle where houses and businesses are scattered about, sometimes randomly, sometimes with a sort of inner logic.  You've got your typical shops and restaurants, the kind you'd find anywhere, alongside fancy offices and bustling malls.  There's always something new to discover, a restaurant to try, a boutique to explore. Big brands rub shoulders with little independent shops, each adding their own flavor to the mix.  These little shops, especially, seem to be popping up everywhere, lining the streets like hidden gems, bringing a touch of life to what would otherwise be quiet corners. And speaking of life, there are parks scattered around too, filled with families enjoying time together.\n\nThe people are as diverse as the shops, a melting pot of cultures and backgrounds. I live in a corner where you'll find a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, a group of Orthodox Jews, and families who fled the former Soviet Union, all finding their place.  Venture a little further, and you'll find pockets of other communities – Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia – each a world unto itself. It's amazing, but these little worlds can be miles apart, even though they're just a short drive away.  \n\nDriving in this city can be a nightmare, though. Ten miles can easily turn into a two-hour journey during rush hour.  Traffic is legendary here, and parking is a mythical creature you rarely encounter.  Ironically, they keep building more apartments, even though everyone seems to be complaining about the traffic and overcrowding.\n\nBut there are different kinds of homes too, not just towering apartment blocks.  There are houses of all shapes and sizes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings. Even within my own neighborhood, you'll find a mix of everything, offering a range of choices.\n\nThe people are just as diverse as the housing.  There are all ages, backgrounds, and stories. Truthfully, I don't know most of my neighbors. We're not a close-knit community like we used to be.  I remember back when I was a kid, playing outside with my next-door neighbors and friends, but those days seem long gone.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a storybook kinda place, you know?  Most of the houses are like those picture-perfect single-family homes, but some of them have been split into two, still stuck together somehow. It's like they're trying to hold onto something, even though things are changing. My place has this little patch of grass out front and a tiny driveway. It's like a snapshot of a time when living in the suburbs was the dream, the American dream.  Back then, it felt like everyone was reaching for it, but now it seems like maybe the dream is slipping away.  But my neighborhood, this little pocket of houses, it still whispers that dream, reminding us that maybe, just maybe, it's still out there somewhere. \n\nYou can see it in the little things.  People aren't as hopeful as they used to be. The yards aren't as perfect, but there's still a car or two in every driveway. The kids are out playing like the whole world is right there in front of them. The old school, the one that's been standing for almost ninety years, it's still there, still holding onto that promise of the future.  It brings back memories for the old folks, and hope for the young ones. The churches are kinda lonely, most of them empty, but the basketball courts are always packed.  \n\nEvery house looks different, but they all feel the same, you know?

Now it's a pharmacy, I guess because everyone needs a little something to make life a little easier. There's this little movie theater, too, showing old movies for cheap. Young folks don't go there, they want all the new releases, but the older folks love it.  It's a night out without the kids, you know?  \n\nThere's a big highway that runs right through town, but the exit and entrance are in the next town over.  We tried to get an exit here, but the young folks wanted it and the old folks said it would ruin the town.  They talked the city council into saying no, and now we're stuck.\n\nThey're building a new high school, and we're trying to figure out what mascot to have. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be perfect.  It's the only thing that makes sense in this town.",

            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past fields of corn that stretched as far as the eye could see. I knew she'd be surprised by how open and empty it all looked. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a hop, skip, and a jump away, so this vast landscape was a whole new world for her. Overwhelmed by all the corn, I told her stories about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe continued down the two-lane road, passing a quarry filled with water. Just past it, nestled among the cornfields, was the small development where I lived. Most of the houses were built from brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that everyone took pride in keeping beautiful. In the spring, colorful flowers bloomed everywhere, surrounded by the midwestern trees that changed colors with each passing season. In the driveways, gleaming Mercedes-Benz cars, the kind that had just come back from a good wash, seemed to sparkle in the midday sun.\n\nAs we drove towards my grey stucco house, I noticed my Korean neighbor outside, always smiling and waving. He spent his days tending to his lawn, and his cheerful singing could be heard faintly over the hum of his lawnmower. Everyone in the neighborhood found it amusing, but he was a genuine and wonderful person with a fascinating history. He was getting older, though, and had lost some of his sharp wit, but he still had a presence about him. In his younger days, he was a doctor, and now he blended in with the grass and his trusty John Deere Zero-Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reached my house. In the side yard, geese waddled around, chased by our playful terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flowed into the quarry, where you could hear the croaking of bullfrogs, the gurgling stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge, there was a peaceful oasis filled with trees, herbs, and wildflowers that grew wild. That's where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, \"hunting\" animals (mostly just chasing them), and always finding someone from the neighborhood to play with.\n\nOur winters could be incredibly harsh, but there was something so beautiful about them. The yard turned from a lush green into a wide-open wilderness. The trees that had once been covered in vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers became bare skeletons of bark. When it snowed, which it did occasionally, a magical winter wonderland appeared overnight. The backyard was filled with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. We fought a lot as kids, and during the winter, snowballs became our weapons of choice. We built huge igloo-like forts to protect our arsenal of branches, turning our backyard into a winter wonderland where we played pretend, oblivious to the world around us. We were just kids, carefree and full of life.",
            "Alright, so you wanna know about Portland, Oregon? Firstly, you gotta get a grasp on this whole \"weird\" thing. It's practically the city's motto, scrawled on the side of a building that somehow manages to be all things at once – a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, even a strip club, walking a fine line with the law most of the time.  \n\nSome folks see it as a throwback to the 90s and early 2000s, back when Portland was a hidden gem, a little rough around the edges, and where a whole bunch of unique personalities thrived. Others see it as an invitation – come on down to Portland, where being a little different isn't just accepted, it's celebrated. Even with all the fancy Californians moving in and the construction cranes building condos for them, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.\n\nNow, \"weird\" doesn't mean everything goes. It's not like we're all hippies living in communes, although there are definitely some of those. We still have our fancy coffee shops, our yoga studios, and our suits-wearing corporate folks. Maybe \"weird\" just means we take everything a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. Houses here are painted in all sorts of crazy colors, gardens burst with flowers and herbs and vegetables, and in the summertime, there are these magical things called \"free boxes\" lining the sidewalks. They're usually cardboard boxes filled with stuff people are getting rid of, but sometimes it's plastic bags or whatever. You never know what treasures you might find inside – clothes, books, maybe even a vintage record player. It's like a treasure hunt every time you walk down the street.\n\nThat's what Portland is all about, at least to me. It's about embracing the unexpected, the quirky, the downright strange. But hey, I'm just one weird person in a city full of them. Some of my neighbors wouldn't be caught dead digging through a free box. They're off doing goat yoga or cheering on the Timbers, the city's soccer team.  \n\nPortland is a city where people chase their dreams, even if those dreams involve spending a little too much time at the bar.  We've got our problems, like any other city. Drug use and homelessness are real issues here, fueled by a combination of mental health struggles and the gloomy weather. But we're trying, even if we're not always sure what the right answer is. We're a city of contradictions, full of love and hate, acceptance and judgment, wonder and despair. \n\nMaybe that's what makes Portland so uniquely weird – it's not afraid to be real, even when real is messy.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, you know?  Like silent guardians to the north, watching the sun rise and set every single day. It doesn't matter if I get caught up in work or life, if I forget about them for a while, they're still there. Strong, steady, not bothered by all the craziness down here. But on days when I'm feeling totally stressed, like my soul is about to burst, they call to me. And when I look at them, they just...calm me. They give me strength to keep going, one step at a time.\n\nI remember when I first moved here for college, it was those north mountains that really stole my heart.  Sure, the campus itself has its own beauty - the buildings, the ponds, the trees - they all hold a special place in my heart. But those mountains, they rule. \n\nThis town, it's got its own charm too. There are these awesome cafes, perfect for late-night studying fueled by caffeine. Just a short walk or bus ride, and you're in the downtown area, feeling all that old-world magic with the colorful, worn-down bricks lining the restaurants and offices. It's like a mini city, buzzing with energy, just like its bigger neighbor. But then, just a few blocks away,  you're back in that peaceful small-town vibe, past the library and everything.  It's this mix of energy and serenity that makes this place so special, like it's just waiting to be explored.  And with all that, it's easy to make memories - good ones, bad ones, all of them. Walking past those rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, the rush of excitement running through the busy downtown to catch a movie, thanks to a free ticket from the university...those are the kind of moments you hold onto. But there are sad ones too, because, well, life happens.\n\nThose ponds, especially, they're good for reflection, for quiet tears at 2 am when you're questioning everything.  I've had my fair share of those. Watching the turtles and ducks and bugs go about their lives, each with their own purpose, made me wonder about my own place in this big, confusing world. So I walked past the pond, past the park, past the houses that screamed \"suburbia,\" until I found myself on a main street. The sun was shining, bathing the palm trees in gold, and as I looked up at the sky, I realized I was walking north.  There they were, just as they'd always been. Those majestic mountains, reaching for the sky, more powerful than any building in sight. And in that moment, without saying a word, they reminded me to keep going.",
            "Oh my goodness, if you're thinking about popping into Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, don't you worry about finding it!  Getting around is a breeze with all the public transportation, it's like the lifeblood of New York City. You'll definitely feel like you're right in the heart of the Big Apple, even though Bensonhurst has its own special charm. Brace yourself for a vibrant mix of Asian cultures! Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurst has become a real melting pot, with a whole wave of Asian folks settling in.   Just take a stroll down the block, and you'll see an Asian-owned store practically every step of the way. Supermarkets and laundromats seem to be the stars of the show, and let me tell you, they're a hit with the locals! The food in those supermarkets is absolutely divine, the prices are super friendly, and it's just so darn convenient to have them right around the corner.  \n\nSpeaking of convenient, there are four Asian supermarkets within a stone's throw of where I am! Talk about making grocery shopping a snap!  Now, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave. It's a beautiful tapestry of cultures, with immigrants and their families making this place their home.  While most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, there's a brand-new park nearby that's a real gem. It's got everything you could imagine: basketball courts, soccer and baseball fields, handball courts, swings, a playground for the little ones, and even a water fountain to keep them cool in the summer heat. It's a true melting pot of kids,  laughing and playing together.\n\nYou won't find many towering corporate buildings here.  Most of the buildings are co-ops or condos, but the majority of folks live in cozy two-family houses.  The people are generally lovely, but a tad noisy, let me tell you! It's like a constant soundtrack of cars blasting music and revving up their engines, even in the morning!  If you're planning a nighttime visit, just keep your wits about you. Bensonhurst is a safe neighborhood, but you know how it is in a big city - sometimes people can be unpredictable. There have been a few instances of petty crime, like package theft. And let's not forget about the dog waste! It seems like every time I step out, there's a little \"present\" waiting for me on the sidewalk.  Keep your eyes peeled and your shoes clean, my friend!",
            "My neighborhood is a bit of a peculiar place. The streets are steep, like a rolling hill, with my house perched at its peak. People jokingly call it the \"workout hill\" because runners love to test their stamina against its incline.  There aren't any sidewalks, so everyone walks on the road, which is a bit bumpy in places. Some of the power lines and telephone wires look like they've seen better days, constantly being patched up after storms whip through, pulling down branches and debris. \n\nEverywhere you look, towering evergreen trees stand sentinel. But the locals aren't too fond of them. They're always trying to chop them down because they obstruct the view of the shimmering ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill, with giant glass second stories that stretch towards the horizon, desperate to catch a glimpse of the bay.\n\nAt sunset, the water catches the fading light, turning the whole scene into a fiery display of orange hues. But the sky's usually shrouded in a thick haze, so those sun-drenched moments are few and far between. Most days are gloomy and damp, with moss creeping onto everything it can – roofs, cars, even railings. Once, I left my car parked in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick, green fuzz. It took ages to scrub it all off!\n\nKids are a rare sight around here. There's a school nearby, but most residents are older folks, enjoying their retirement. They seem to prefer the company of dogs, which roam freely, playing in yards or chasing each other down the street.  Be careful if you leave a door or window open – those dogs will sneak in without hesitation!\n\nRabbits are another common sight, hopping around and causing havoc in gardens. The gardeners despise them, but my cats adore them, practically hunting them out of existence.  We also have the usual assortment of birds: flitting sparrows, buzzing hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle, until the neighborhood crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but if you're willing to hike down to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can practically see the other side even through the mist.",
            "Life in our little corner of Tennessee is pretty laid back. We're right smack-dab in the middle of a quiet suburb, tucked between two state highways. You know, the kind of place where folks wave hello as they drive by.  Traffic can be a bit much sometimes, but it's nothing too crazy. Most folks here have been around forever,  so it feels like one big family.\n\nWe're a pretty typical family – me, my wife, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. We work from home, so we're always around, and the kids are always out and about, playing bike games and such.  We love to play outside, rain or shine. We even have a back deck where we fire up the grill. There's always that delicious smell of barbecue floating around, especially during the warmer months.  \n\nOur neighborhood is like a big green haven.  It used to be all woods, so there are still plenty of trees around, which means a whole lot of shade during the summer and a whole lot of leaves to rake in the fall.  I gotta admit, I kinda love the smell of burning leaves. It just screams, \"Fall is here!\"\n\nThese days, it feels like we're skipping right from summer to winter, though. We haven't had much of a true winter at all.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's come knocking. But when I'm working on my truck in the garage, with the doors open, I feel like I'm right in the heart of all the neighborhood action.\n\nHolidays are pretty quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving when everyone's got family visiting. Those are the days when the streets are filled with cars and there's a real sense of togetherness.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't trade this little slice of life for anything. If it weren't for the traffic from the highways, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighbourhood, it's smack dab in the middle of the high desert, you know, dirt as far as the eye can see. Unless you've actually lived here, it's hard to truly understand. You get used to seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you just know that person's dropping serious cash on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out, like you could practically spit from one to the next. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a ton of new houses popping up. This place is starting to feel more and more like a city every day, I guess that's what happens everywhere, right? Most folks here are really friendly, but like any place, you've got your good parts and your not-so-good parts. My neighborhood is pretty chill, surrounded by friendly old folks. The stores around here, they're mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want something fancier, you gotta drive. I don't see any Whole Foods or anything like that. \n\nThe jobs around here, if I had to guess, are mostly construction. I think it's because this city's still growing, there's so much open space left to build on. It kinda scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not looking to go back. \n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the desert itself is pretty special. \n\nThe high desert climate and the way the land looks have made for some pretty tough environments, and those environments are home to all kinds of cool creatures. People who live here should really try to learn about the animals that share their space so we can all get along. My family and I have gotten used to living with the wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside trying to catch some.  As for things to do, we've got some attractions. Victorville is a pretty good place for families to experience the desert life. It's a different kind of experience, for sure. If you can swing it, try to visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a ton of fun. \n\nYou can also head over to Wrightwood, nearby, to see the snow-covered mountains and take some lessons if you're feeling adventurous. If you're interested in the history and nature of the high desert, check out the Victor Valley Museum. They've got all sorts of cool stuff there: rocks, fossils, Native American artifacts, and things that tell the story of how Victorville grew up.",
            "Hmm...you know, if you asked me to describe my neighbourhood, it'd be a little different from what most folks would say. While they probably think of houses and backyards, my neighbourhood is more like a giant dorm. See, I live on campus, and my whole world revolves around the people in my dorm and the buildings around it. The campus itself kind of becomes my neighbourhood, even if it's a bit more spread out. But hey, even though it's unique, it still has those things you'd find in any other neighbourhood.\n\nLet's start with the \"houses,\" shall we? Now, my neighbourhood has these three types of places to live: apartments, actual houses, and dorm rooms. First, there are the apartments, usually with 2 to 4 people sharing each room. Each floor has around 4 to 6 rooms, and the buildings are usually two stories high. So, you've got about 20 people living in each building.\n\nThen, there are the actual houses, scattered around the campus. These are for people who work at the school or maybe some alumni. They're usually 2 to 4 bedrooms and not as common as the apartments. The most common places to live are the dorm rooms, though. They're where most students stay, with two people sharing a room, except for a few exceptions.\n\nNow, about the people. My school is all about diversity, and you can really see that in my neighbourhood. There are folks from all walks of life, all ages, all backgrounds. The staff usually live in the houses, the new students in the dorm rooms, and the older ones in the apartments.\n\nTalking about all the different people here would take forever, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is its own little world, it has everything you need. There are tons of places to eat, just like in any neighbourhood, plus the school's own stores for clothes and groceries.  \n\nAnd then there's the park, a place for everyone to hang out and relax. It's always clean and safe, thanks to all the people who live here.",
            "Hmm...moving here ten years ago was a big change. Like, I was heartbroken leaving Riverdale and my friends. It felt like I was ripped away from everything familiar. I cried a lot, missing them terribly.  But my parents, they wanted the best for me and my little sister, you know? So, we moved to Stockbridge, hoping for better schools, a better life,  away from what they called \"ghetto.\" It took a while to adjust, to make new friends, even some new rivals. Truth be told, I never really got to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a little while. They were like family, though, always there to make things brighter. I remember when my mom, dad, and sister went to Mr. Glen's wedding - they got remarried! It was such a blast, dancing the night away. I even caught the little white strap off his wife's leg!  Sadly, I missed the bouquet. I really enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, though. Hope she's doing great!\n\nThis neighborhood is like a giant maze, but now I have a GPS, so I can explore more. I've only been to a few places, mainly where I hang out with my buddies, Kason and Curtis. We used to be video game addicts! We just lived life to the fullest, you know? Sometimes I'd head to the park, just to be surrounded by nature. It calms me down, gives me a sense of peace. I even bring sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and sometimes my bokken, just for fun.\n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court too, even though I haven't touched a racket or a ball in ages. It's nice to have them around, just in case I feel like playing again. My dad and Mr. Graves taught me how to play tennis with my best friend. We had so much fun, even though they pushed us hard! Looking back,  there are so many fun memories in this neighborhood, and I know there are even more amazing times waiting for me.",
            "Oh my gosh, living near my college is such a sweet deal!  My neighbourhood is like a little haven, mostly filled with apartment buildings, but sprinkled with a few cute little restaurants and bars that are totally wallet-friendly.  There's this one bar that just got a makeover and now it's a bit pricier, but hey, it's not like it's terrible.  The people here are mostly college students or people who are just starting out, so it's got that whole laid-back vibe.  And speaking of laid-back, there are tons of little kids running around because there's an elementary school nearby.  \n\nMy neighbours?  Well, let's just say I'm perfectly happy keeping things cordial from a distance. They're a bit ...enthusiastic about their herbal relaxation methods, which is kinda funny because the building management put this giant air freshener right outside their door!  It's like they're trying to mask the aroma, but it's more embarrassing for them, you know?\n\nMost of the buildings around here are a bit vintage, but a lot of them have been spruced up on the inside.  Down the street, there's a bunch of brand new apartments, but those are a total no-go for me.  They look cheap and flimsy, and the rent is sky-high!  It's like they're taking advantage of the fact that they're near campus, but whatever.\n\nThere's this amazing little hole-in-the-wall restaurant just a hop, skip, and a jump away. They serve everything on paper plates and most of it is microwaved, but it's so cheap and tasty!  Right across from that is a gas station, which I heard is a nightmare to work at. \n\nBut the best part is that last summer, the city finally decided to give our street a makeover!  They put in a brand new sidewalk, tons of grass, and now it's actually kind of pretty.  My apartment building is totally tucked away behind a bunch of trees, although they did have to chop down a few.  There's a whole line of trees behind my complex, and then another set of apartments on 43rd Street.  That street isn't as charming as mine.  The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings look a little rough around the edges, and there are a lot of trees, probably to hide the less glamorous parts.\n\nHonestly, there's been a bit of trouble around here, mostly at another apartment complex on 43rd Street.  But hey, I can't blame them completely.  There are some apartments across from me that have their share of issues too.\n\nBut you know what? I still love where I live. It's affordable, I'm close to everything, and best of all, the university is right around the corner!  I can walk there or hop on a bus, and there are buses that take me downtown and to the store too.",
            "My neighborhood feels like stepping back in time. It's a collection of yellow duplexes on a little cul-de-sac, spaced out so they look like single houses. Each one has a white porch and a green metal roof, making them all look quite charming. Almost everyone here knows each other, and we often gather at the end of one of the driveways to chat while the kids play. It's so refreshing to find this sense of community in our crazy, technology-driven world.  \n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees, under skies painted with blue and fluffy white clouds. It's a picture-perfect setting, but lately, we've been getting tornado warnings. Last night, we even heard the sirens, and I found myself scrambling for shelter in my bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and a few pillows. My big dog, on the other hand, stayed in the living room, barking nervously at the strange sounds.  \n\nThe hail that fell during the storm was so loud, it sounded like it was raining rocks. The roads steamed after the storm because the temperature dropped so quickly from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes! The hail melted on the hot pavement as soon as it hit. As the storm cleared, the sun peeked out and a double rainbow arched across the sky. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my friends and family – everyone was amazed.\n\nThe neighborhood stayed quiet for a while, then people slowly started to trickle back home. Soon, it was back to normal – moms and kids outside, dinner cooking on the stove. Life feels so friendly here. I recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, and I adore the southern accents.\n\nWe all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, though the insides are different. Some are surprisingly small, which seems a bit odd.\n\nI love taking walks in the huge field behind our homes, down to the pond (though it's not meant for swimming). I've seen deer there and in the mornings, I can hear the biggest bullfrog singing his heart out. It's just a wonderful place to live, only forty minutes from Charlotte. Every morning, we wake up to the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It feels like living in a small, close-knit village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm whose braying in the evening lets us know he's around. I feel so lucky to have found this little slice of paradise.",
            "Hmm, so I moved into this area right when I was starting eighth grade. Making new friends was a tough one at first, but then I got close to a couple of guys - one lives just two houses down, and the other one's on my street. They're not around anymore, but those memories, they linger. It's funny how the same faces have stayed put all these years. My neighborhood, it's like any other American suburb, you know? All those two-story houses, and every time the weather's nice, the sound of kids playing outside fills the air. It's usually pretty quiet though, except for the weekends.\n\nNever had any trouble with the folks around here. It's like, leave you alone unless you need something, which is nice. I've ordered a ton of stuff online, and not once has anything gone missing from my porch. Yeah, I trust these neighbors.\n\nThere's this park just a stone's throw away, man, it's packed with memories. Played basketball, football, baseball there with the neighborhood crew back in the day.  Even had one of my worst memories there - got elbowed in the nose playing football, ouch! But hey, the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Now, when I go to the park, it's all about hanging with my cousins' kids. They're way younger, still into the swings and slides and stuff. Just thinking about going there gets them hyped up.\n\nThe park, it just takes me back, you know?\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a melting pot, really. You got every kind of food imaginable within a hop, skip, and a jump. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a mile radius. These days, though, everybody just orders in with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.\n\nThe usual suspects are the fast food joints, but you find those everywhere, right?  There's a ton of pizza places too.  And the stores, they got everything you could ever need. Dry cleaners on every corner, a Walgreens, a CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store - a Midwest staple. \n\nThere's even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling adventurous and want to whip up some homemade curry or grab some ready-made stuff.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with my neighborhood. Reading all these horror stories about other people's neighbors online and on the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Oh, my little town, Johnston... it's just a speck on the map of South Carolina, not fancy like some places, but it's got a heart of gold.  You see, everyone knows Johnston as the Peach Capital of the World, and let me tell you, they wear that title proudly.  Everywhere you go, it's either peach trees as far as the eye can see or cows grazing in the fields.  \n\nThe houses, well, they're mostly spread out like stars in the night sky.  Most of them are two stories tall, with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or those faded gray shingles.  They're not right on the road either, but kinda tucked back, giving them space to have their own little gardens or maybe even a place for the animals.  \n\nThe main part of town?  You can practically find everything there.  There’s a single stoplight, like the heart of it all, and around it are the shops.  Hungry? You've got options: Hong Kong, a cozy Chinese place run by a family, Fiesta for some Mexican flavors, or Gary's, a burger joint that's a hometown favorite.  Used to be a pizza place too, but it closed down a while back, leaving a bit of a hole in the heart of town.\n\nThere's Maxwell and Halford Drug, the only pharmacy around, and they're famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  Then there's IGA, the grocery store.  It's a little fancy and pricey, so most folks just pop in for a few things and head to Batesburg-Leesville for the big grocery haul.  But let me tell you, the people love Dollar General!  It's got everything you need, and it's always buzzing with activity.\n\nOh, and there's Possibilities Furniture & More, owned by a sweet lady who knows everyone.  They've been around forever, even have their own movers! Right next to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where you can pamper your furry friends with baths, haircuts, and even daycare.  \n\nThe doctor and the vet are a bit away from the main drag, but they're both good folks who take care of everyone in town.  There’s Johnston Elementary School, but after fifth grade, the kids have to go to the next town for middle and high school.  We don't have any parks, but they're working on a little spot for families to enjoy.\n\nIt's a quiet town, not much to do, no movie theaters or fancy restaurants.  You blink, and you might miss it!  But it's got a special charm, a place where folks look out for each other.",
            "My ears first caught wind of this place  while I was lost in a podcast about missing folks. It was a bit of a shock, to be honest.  Apartments around here were going for over a thousand a month, and I'd never heard a peep about this story, not even from my friends. Maybe it's the struggle, you know? I know some of my friends end their days with tears, things are tight. Everything's expensive, but we've learned to be clever with our money over the years. You start to get a fondness for that dusty smell of flea market treasures and clothes that have seen better days. You just don't smell as much as you used to when you were younger. You might pick up a habit like smoking, or maybe it's just that you're used to the way things are. But that flea market feeling always lingers. The smell of grown-up life is dusty magazines piled on a dusty piano, clinging to the leather and staying even after you wash it.\n\nAround here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and even a curio shop. Downtown is a bustling place, cars and people jam the streets every morning, but you wouldn't hear a thing of it inside those shops. No matter how many people or cars whiz by, the stores are quiet sanctuaries.\n\nIt's a beautiful place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more of these kinds of places popping up. Cars and people keep flooding the city. It's a growing city, they say. With one of the biggest online empires for shopping and delivery calling it home, it still has those growing pains. It reminds me of New York, with everyone focused on their own goals and not really asking much from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and no one bats an eye. It's not like back in the South, where a little concern means you care deeply. People here don't pry into your life. You can keep your walls up as long as you want, and the city just rolls on like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on.\n\nIn a way, we have less of an apartment building of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other out when we can. I feel lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them their mail and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in this massive, impersonal, modern sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't totally messed up my life.",
            "My place is in one of those neighborhoods that, well, they're all pretty much the same, you know? It's just like cookie-cutter suburbia, with everyone following the same rules.  The homeowners' association, they're really big here, and it shows.  Every house looks the same - neat and tidy, with a little patch of lawn, some pebbles, and a pretty short driveway. There are a few trees sprinkled around, and every house has a two-car garage. The streets are always freshly paved, no potholes or anything like that, which is good because you see a lot of cars going around. \n\nMost houses are single story, but sometimes you'll find a two-story one.  The mailboxes are different here, too. We don't have individual ones in front of each house like you'd expect.  It's more like an apartment building, with a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street.  Everyone has a key to their own box, and there are even two big lockers for packages.  The HOA is all about uniformity, you see. My street is on the edge of the city, so it's kind of a mix between suburbia and the country. We have a lot of space here, which is nice. There are community pools that everyone can use, they're always clean and gated. And there are walking trails where you can take your dog or just go for a walk.\n\nMost of the people here are retired folks, and it's a really safe place. Everyone knows each other and looks out for each other. There are a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in, too. The city itself is pretty big, but it still has that small-town feel. We have most of the things you need, like a mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to anything really interesting, but once you get there, there are plenty of stores to choose from.  You can find everything from fancy organic grocery stores to bargain stores with just a few things and barely any staff. Overall, my neighborhood is pretty nice. It's safe, well-kept, and pretty typical. We have some good things, like pools and walking trails. And while we're not right next to any big shopping centers, it's a quick drive to get to them.",
            "My heart belongs to this little town, nestled just outside the bustling city.  Life here, on the east side, is a bit simpler, a little slower.  It's what some might call \"working class,\"  the houses aren't fancy, but they're filled with warm hearts and friendly faces.  You see, my neighbors are the kind who greet you with a smile and a wave, making you feel like you belong.  \n\nSure, there have been tough times, whispers of trouble that make their way into our quiet streets.  A couple of times, the news brought stories of violence, shootings, even a tragedy where a young man lost his life right outside a bar.  It was a stark reminder that even in this peaceful haven, shadows can creep in.  Happily, our family has been spared, our home a safe haven, though we've had our share of porch pirates.  \n\nBut this town, like so many others, has been grappling with a heavy burden - the grip of the opioid epidemic.  It's a dark cloud that hangs over us, stealing dreams and leaving families shattered.  But even in this darkness, there's a flicker of hope.  We've got folks here who care, who are fighting back.  There are places offering help to those struggling with addiction, training programs to equip families with the tools to face this challenge.\n\nNow, let me tell you about the heart of this town, my son's school.  It's a beacon of light, filled with dedicated teachers and staff who truly love and support every child.  My son, who has his own unique needs, thrives there.  He's never felt excluded, never encountered unkindness.  It's a testament to the kindness and inclusivity that permeates the school.  And the parents?  They're a force to be reckoned with!  The PTO is constantly buzzing with activity, organizing events that bring families together and celebrate learning.  The school provides free meals for every child, ensuring no hungry tummy goes unnoticed.  It's a place where every child feels valued, no matter their background or circumstances.\n\nOur town has its share of cosmetic flaws, though.  The city has done a fantastic job sprucing up the downtown area and the west side, where all the shops and restaurants are.  But on the east side, where I call home, things haven't seen the same attention.  It's a bit of a sore spot for us, a reminder that sometimes, progress isn't evenly distributed.\n\nBut despite these imperfections, this town is my home.  It's a place with a good heart, a place where people care for one another.  It's where my roots run deep, where our family has built a life.  And for all its challenges, I wouldn't trade it for anything.",
            "My neighborhood, it's like a tapestry woven with stories.  Sitting high on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of times gone by. I live in a seven-story apartment building, right across from an old theater, its faded grandeur a constant reminder of a bygone era. Just down the street, tucked away on The Hill, is this little bar with arcade games - a magnet for all sorts of folks, especially on warm summer nights.  You see lines snaking around the block, especially in June and July,  waiting to step into that lively space. A few blocks up, there's a park, a big one for this part of town.  Surrounding it, there's concrete, with these tall stairs built right into the walls. Come winter, when the rain comes down in sheets, you'll see tents lining the sidewalk and those wide steps.  Homeless folks, they huddle together, nestled in the heart of the city, not out in the harsh wilderness. It's a way to stay warm, and being close to the city center means they're within reach of the nearest place they can bathe and shower. \n\nBut what I truly cherish about my city isn't the historic buildings, the proud structures that climb the hills towards the ocean, though they are pretty spectacular.  It's the people, their resilience and spirit that make this place so special. You see, Hilltop used to be notorious, the most dangerous neighborhood on the West Coast. Thirty years later, stories still linger, tales of federal agents and the DEA trying to clean up the streets.  The people here, they carry those stories, pass them down through generations.  \n\nEven though Hilltop is still considered rough around the edges, they work hard to keep it clean, to keep it theirs. They care. There's this old saying, that white folks shouldn't walk around after dark, a warning that echoes the past, tinged with a bitterness that comes from prejudice. Perhaps it's because I have a shade of darkness that lets me blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees a bit of their own story reflected in me, someone who understands those lingering reminders of racism and fear that haunt our nation, even in a city that prides itself on being a melting pot. \n\nWhatever it is, I know this: no matter where I wander, Hilltop is home.  I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where the laundromat owner stays open a few extra minutes so I can charge my phone when caught in a downpour. It's a place where, on a bleak night, I can huddle against a store front, feeling invisible, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me a five dollar bill, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "My heart belongs to Rural America, specifically a little town in Michigan where fields of green stretch as far as the eye can see, giving way to charming tourist spots. We don't have those big city things like malls, Wal-mart, or even an Applebee's. If you need something, you gotta hop in the car and drive. But let me tell you, even without all that, I live in one of the most beautiful places on Earth, surrounded by shimmering water. My town, it's practically an island.  Lake Michigan graces one side, and Lake Charlevoix the other. Every turn brings you to a beach where you can dangle your feet in the cool waves.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a postcard of small-town living. Houses aren't crammed together like sardines. No cookie-cutter homes here. They're older, some with fresh coats of paint and modern touches, others keeping their original charm. Most have full basements, visible from the street, and many sport that classic aluminum siding. Houses come in every color imaginable – a rainbow parade right down my street!\n\nMost have yards, too, bursting with life. Trampolines bounce, playsets swing, and kids run wild. Gardens bloom, fences enclose families' furry friends, and the air hums with the sounds of life. It's a neighborhood of hard-working folks, raising families and building lives. On any given day, you'll see kids zipping around on bikes and scooters, dogs getting their walk on, and neighbors exchanging smiles and waves.\n\nThe lawns are always neat and tidy – no piles of leaves, just green grass neatly trimmed. Plants and bushes are pruned and cared for, adding splashes of color to the landscape. It's not a neighborhood that screams \"wealth\" or \"luxury,\" but it whispers \"welcome home.\" It's a place where you feel safe, where kids can play freely, and where neighbors look out for each other.\n\nYou can walk to the sheriff’s department and the jail, the health department just a hop, skip, and a jump away. The recycling center is down the road, serving folks from all over town.  The smell of freshly cut grass blends with the sounds of baseball games and the roar of small planes taking off and landing at the nearby airport.  Ice cream calls from the local shop, and a short bike ride takes you to the park, where laughter and joy echo through the air.\n\nThis is a place where life slows down, where you can breathe easy and build a future you're proud of. It's a place where you can truly belong."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My city is a real melting pot, you know? It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle with all these different pieces fitting together in a crazy way.  Living here is like being on a never-ending adventure. You've got your residential pockets scattered all over the place, tucked in between shops and restaurants and offices.  It's like a feast for the senses, with new places popping up all the time. \n\nWe've got those big, fancy stores that everyone knows, but then there are these hidden gems, these little boutiques that just make you want to pop in. They're everywhere, even on quiet streets you wouldn't expect, adding a touch of magic to the everyday.  And don't even get me started on the parks! They're always filled with families, kids running around, having fun. It's heartwarming to see. \n\nSpeaking of diverse, this place is bursting with different cultures.  Right here in my neighborhood, you've got your LGBTQ+ folks, a tight-knit Orthodox Jewish community, and even folks who have made their way here from the old Soviet Union. It's like a little world within a world.  \n\nAnd if you venture a little further out, you'll find even more communities, like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia... they're all just a stone's throw away, but sometimes getting there feels like a journey. Traffic can be a nightmare, especially during rush hour.  You can drive for miles and miles, but it might only take you a few blocks.\n\nIt's funny, though, because even with all this traffic, everyone seems to be adding more buildings to the city.  New apartment blocks are springing up everywhere, but some people are starting to worry that it's getting too crowded.\n\nBut hey, there's something for everyone here. You've got your big apartment buildings, your cozy houses, even duplexes.  It's all mixed up, just like the people who live here.\n\nI've lived here my whole life, but I still feel like I'm constantly meeting new people.  It's not exactly a tight-knit community anymore, but that's okay. It's still exciting, always something new to discover. Maybe that's the beauty of city life, always keeping you on your toes.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a quirky little slice of America, ya know? Most of the houses are like those classic single-family ones, but some folks split 'em up, making two homes out of one, still attached like twins. My place has got a little patch of grass out front and a teeny driveway, just enough for one car. It's like a picture postcard from a bygone era, back when the American dream meant living in the suburbs.  Back then, it felt like everyone was chasing that dream, but now, it's like the dream's drifting away, getting harder to hold onto. \n\nBut my neighborhood, it's still holding strong, whispering that the dream's still out there, just gotta keep reachin' for it. Folks ain't as hopeful as they used to be, the lawns ain't as manicured, but you still see a couple cars in most driveways, and the kids, they're running wild, like the world's their playground. There's this old school, been around for nigh on 90 years, still standing tall, givin' kids a glimpse of the future, while the old folks reminisce about their own school days. Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts? Packed! All the houses look different, but they all feel the same, like they're part of the same story.\n\nWe got this big supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by this big, friendly Yemeni family, they're probably the only Arab folks around here. Most folks are African American, generations deep, with stories about when everyone knew everyone.\n\nThere used to be a karate school, but when those Karate Kid movies went outta style, kids lost interest, so now it's a pharmacy. Guess they figured pills were the new kung fu, huh? Then there's this tiny movie theater, showing oldies for cheap.  Too old-fashioned for the young folks, but the older folks love it, a night out without all the hustle and bustle.\n\nWe got this expressway runnin' through town, but the on and off ramps are just outside our borders. Tried to get an exit, young folks wanted it, but the old-timers said it'd ruin our town. They got their way, kept things just the way they were. Now they're buildin' a new high school, and we're tryin' to pick a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a Southern drawl and a log cabin would sum up our town pretty good.",
            "Hmm...you might just miss it at first glance, this little corner tucked behind the shops. Not the kinda place you'd think folks would want to call home, not at first. But pry past the old, dusty Whole Foods and past the hotels that mostly sit empty, save for a few family get-togethers in the summer, and you'll stumble onto a whole world buzzing with life.  It's like a secret society, these streets and these apartment complexes huddled together like a bunch of Russian nesting dolls, all taken apart and laid out in a line.  You'll see some complexes that've been in the news for some not-so-nice stuff, so let's not dwell on those, yeah? Appearances can be deceiving. But the ones next to those, the ones beside those, those are a whole other story, a world most folks around here never even know about.\n\nJust across from those complexes, you've got this community college, a little branch campus. Quiet as a mouse, it is, with students shuffling in, coffee in hand, yawning like it's the end of the world at seven in the morning. The iron gates creak open for them one by one, while folks rushing to work shake their fists and grumble about them slowing things down on busy days. The road just kinda forks off into another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehab center for folks who've had a few… mishaps.

            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the endless cornfields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she wouldn't believe how simple and open everything was. She was used to living in a town where everything was just a short walk away, she'd never seen this much space in her life. Overwhelmed by all the corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we continued down this two-lane country road, we came to a quarry filled with water.

My sister and I used to fight a lot when we were kids, and in the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice.

            "Hmm...let me tell you about Portland, Oregon, this place with a unique kind of \"weirdness\". You'll see it everywhere, even on the side of a building that's part pizza joint, part bar, part music venue, part strip club...you get the picture.  They say \"Keep Portland Weird\" there, like it's a promise.  Some folks, they remember the old Portland, back when it was still hidden away and affordable. That's the Portland that birthed all the creative, quirky subcultures. Others, well, they see it as an invitation - come to Portland, where being different is a good thing, something to celebrate.  Even with all those fancy Californians moving in and those shiny new condos popping up everywhere, Portland still holds onto that weirdness.\n\nBut what exactly does \"weird\" mean here? It's not about being totally accepting of everything, no. It's about accepting the things that might make others raise an eyebrow. It's about knowing that we still have all the modern conveniences and the same everyday struggles as anywhere else. Sure, we buy most of our stuff from China, just like everyone else. There are a million ways to be different, to not fit in, and Portland has plenty of those. \n\nYou'll find yoga studios, hipsters, and suits working in offices here, just like anywhere else. Maybe \"weird\" just means we take it all a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, and in lots of others, you'll see houses painted in all sorts of bright colors, gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and even free boxes lining the sidewalks. These boxes, well, they're a Portland tradition. They're filled with treasures - clothes, books, sometimes even something completely unexpected. It's like a little surprise waiting for you around every corner.  \n\nThat magical feeling of discovering something special in the most ordinary places, that's what Portland is all about to me. At least, that's my version of weird. I know there are thousands of other kinds of weird here. Some folks wouldn't dream of taking anything out of a box on the street. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yes, you read that right!) or cheer on the Timbers soccer team. Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things, dream big, or at least dream about dreaming big while sipping a pint at the local pub. \n\nWe're not perfect, though. Like anywhere else, we have our struggles. Portland has a drug problem, and it's hard not to see the connection between that and the mental health issues that often go hand in hand. The constant rain and gray skies probably don't help either. And then there's the issue of homelessness, a problem that seems to plague every city. Portland tries to help, but our programs aren't enough.  Some people here are compassionate, while others just give up hope. Honestly, that's not so weird, is it? It's just part of being human.",
            "The mountains, they've always been there, like silent guardians watching over everything. Northward, they stand tall, witnessing every sunrise and sunset, unmoved by the hustle and bustle of life. Even when I'm caught up in my studies or work, they're still there, solid and unwavering. On days when stress weighs heavy on me, they seem to call out, demanding to be seen. And when I turn to them, they offer a calming presence, a source of strength to carry on, one day at a time.\n\nIt all started when I first moved here for university. The mountains north of campus captured my heart immediately. The university itself has its own beauty – the buildings, the ponds, the trees – each holding a special place in my memory. But the mountains, they rule them all.  \n\nThe town itself is a charming mix of the familiar and the unexpected. There are countless cafes where I spent countless hours fueled by coffee and late-night study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where faded brick buildings whisper stories of a bygone era. It's here that the town pulses with a vibrant energy, almost as if it's trying to outshine its bustling city neighbor. But just a few blocks away, you can escape back to the peaceful charm of small-town life, passing by the library on your way. This beautiful contrast, this close proximity of two distinct atmospheres, gives the town a magical quality, inviting you to explore its every nook and cranny.\n\nIt's a town where memories are made, both cherished and bittersweet. There's the rusty swing set in the park, where friends and I would congregate after all-nighters, or the frantic dash through the downtown area to catch a movie at the fancy theater thanks to a student discount. But like all places, it holds its share of painful memories too. The ponds, especially, seem to be a magnet for introspection and tearful confessions at 2 a.m. during existential crises – an experience I've had more times than I care to admit.\n\nWhile watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each with their own purpose, I couldn't help but question my own path. I walked past the pond, the park, the houses that screamed suburbia, until I found myself on a main street. As I walked, the sun bathed the palm trees in its golden light, painting the sky with vibrant hues. Looking up, I realized I was heading north. And there they were, as steadfast as ever. The mountains, majestically towering above everything else, their presence a silent reminder of my own strength and perseverance.",
            "My, oh my, if you ever find yourself planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it!  Getting around is a breeze, especially with the awesome public transportation, you know, one of the big things in New York City.  Bensonhurst has a real city vibe, so you'll be smack-dab in the heart of it all.  \n\nAnd speaking of vibes, get ready for a real sensory experience! You'll see these amazing Asian stores everywhere you look. In the last twenty years or so, Bensonhurst has become a real melting pot, especially with all the Asian folks moving in.  It's like every block has an Asian-owned store, you'll be spoiled for choice! Supermarkets and laundromats seem to be the most popular, and they're a hit with everyone, not just the Asian community. The food in the supermarkets is top-notch, the prices are super reasonable, and let's be honest, it's just so darn convenient. I mean, I live right near a cluster of four Asian supermarkets, all within a couple of minutes walking distance! Talk about convenience!\n\nBut don't think Bensonhurst is all about one culture, oh no! It's a real mix of people, with immigrants, and their kids who are first and second generation Americans, all living together.  While most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, there's a cool new park nearby that's got something for everyone. Ten basketball courts, a huge field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for the little ones, even a water fountain to cool off in the summer. It's a true melting pot, with people from all walks of life hanging out and getting along.\n\nAs for buildings, you won't find too many big, corporate towers here. Mostly, it's co-op buildings and condos. The majority of peeps live in these cute two-family houses, though.  The people here are generally nice, but can be a bit noisy, if you catch my drift.  Cars blasting music as they drive by,  people revving their engines in the morning...it can wake you right up! If you're planning to be out at night, keep your wits about you.  Bensonhurst is pretty safe, but you never know when you might run into some troublemakers, bullies, or even thieves. I've been through some things here myself, a few run-ins in the past, nothing too bad, but it's good to be aware. \n\nAnother thing, there's been a bit of a package theft problem lately.  Not a good look, right?  And while New York City has rules about cleaning up after your dog, some folks don't seem to get the memo.  Every morning, you'll probably see at least one piece of dog waste on your way to the train or the supermarket.  It's a real pet peeve of mine, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood is a peculiar place, perched precariously on the highest hill in town. People call it the \"workout hill\" because all the runners love to challenge themselves with its steep incline. The lack of sidewalks forces everyone to walk on the road, which is cracked and uneven in spots, making it a bit of a bumpy ride. The power lines strung across the street tell a story of their own, tattered and patched together after countless encounters with falling branches and storms.  \n\nEverywhere you look, towering evergreen trees stand sentinel.  But here's the funny thing - folks around here despise them! They're always trying to chop them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are built high up on the hill, with giant second stories boasting glass walls, desperately trying to catch a glimpse of the bay.\n\nSunsets are breathtaking, though. The water shimmers like liquid gold, and the sky explodes in a blaze of orange. Most days, though, the clouds steal the show, shrouding everything in a soft, damp haze. Moss thrives in this dampness, clinging to roofs, cars, even railings. Once, I left my car parked for a month, and it emerged looking like a furry green monster - three hours of scrubbing later, it was finally clean.\n\nKids are a rare sight in our neighborhood.  There's a school just a few blocks away, but it's mostly populated by retired folks.  Dogs, on the other hand, are everywhere. You'll find them lounging on lawns, chasing each other down the street, or sometimes, even sneaking into your house if you leave a door open!  I once found one in my living room, patiently waiting for a treat.\n\nRabbits also roam freely, much to the annoyance of gardeners who find their burrows digging up precious plants. But my cats are thrilled, having hunted most of them out of our yard.  We also have our fair share of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle, who often get chased away by the resident crows.\n\nThere aren't any stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood.  The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can easily see the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "Hmm... life here is kinda like one of those slow-moving movies, you know?  I live on this little street in a sleepy town down south, kinda tucked between two busy highways.  So, we get our fair share of traffic, nothin' too wild though. It's a pretty quiet neighborhood, most folks here have lived here for ages, so we all know each other pretty well.  It's the kind of place where everyone's busy with their own thing - tending to their yards, running errands, that kinda stuff.   \n\nWe live on the corner, so we get a front-row seat to all the neighborhood action. We know all the cars that go by, and if somethin' new rolls up, well, we take notice.  Some folks like to take walks, others walk their dogs, and the kids, they're always whizzing around on their bikes.  \n\nMy wife and I work from home, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen, are always underfoot. We're pretty much homebodies, so everyone's used to seeing us come and go. We love to play outside, even when it's drizzling, and we'll fire up the grill on our back deck whenever we get the chance.  It's like an unspoken rule - you gotta smell that barbecue at least once a week! \n\nThere's nothin' but trees around here, it used to be all woods, so we've got plenty of shade, but that means a whole lot of leaves come Fall. Raking and burning leaves is practically a family tradition. That smoky smell just screams \"Autumn\" to me, you know?\n\nThis year, we haven't had much of a winter at all, just a long, drawn-out Fall.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we only use the front door for company, which isn't often.\n\nI like to tinker in the garage with my truck or other projects, and when the doors are open, I feel like I'm more connected to the whole neighborhood. Holidays are a little more lively - Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas - folks come visit and the street gets crowded with cars.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty good life here.  If it weren't for that through-street traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where it's dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably don't get it. Like, you just don't understand the feeling of seeing brown everywhere you look. And when you do see a lawn, you know that person is dropping serious cash on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first lived here, the houses were spread out like they were trying to escape each other. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a bunch of new places popping up. Honestly, it's starting to feel more like a city every day, but I guess that's happening everywhere, right?\n\nMost of the people here are really friendly, just like in any place, you have your ups and downs. But in my part of town, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so it's a pretty nice place to be.\n\nThe stores around here are mostly the chain kind, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for something upscale, you gotta drive a bit. Never see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here. \n\nBased on what I see, the biggest industry in town is construction. I think that's because the city is still growing. There are still tons of wide-open spaces waiting to be built on.  It kinda freaks me out, actually. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city, and I'm not looking to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living – drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nOne of the things I love about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert itself is definitely a big draw. The high desert climate and landscape have created some pretty amazing ecosystems that need protecting. We share this space with all sorts of awesome creatures, and it's important that we learn about them so we can live together peacefully.\n\nMy family and I have gotten pretty good at coexisting with the wildlife. I have three kids, and they're obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. They're out there right now, trying to catch all sorts of interesting critters.\n\nAs for things to do around here, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert in a different way.  If you're visiting, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a ton of fun, and it really captures the Victorville spirit.  \n\nYou can also head up to nearby Wrightwood to see the snowy mountains and even take a winter sports lesson. \n\nIf you're interested in learning about the history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit. They have all sorts of cool stuff – geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how Victorville came to be.",
            "Hmm...my heart n soui went to Taiwan last Thursday,on the 1st to be precise. Im going to miss him and it has only been a day and yet here I am looking at his photo... again and again as if the world is going to come tumbling down.  Yup...his job is kinda time constraining,him an officer in the army ... I have to live with that for the rest of my life. Yet, I am happy with him. There's chemistry and we could talk about anything from weapons,politics or even the simple terminology of self reflection. I feel safe with him...maybe he is my knight n shinning armour who  has come to save me amidst the confusion. He was so sweet,the day he called me before he flew off, he said ' In any decision that you are going to make, I will say yes to it all,I wiil support you and at the end of the day, I will always be there for you,' I almost cried when he said that, Ive been waiting for someone to tell me that.  Dear Khai,my knight and shinning armour, come back to me when your job is done...   Untukmu Khai  Untukmu Ku saluti benang-benang sutera, menjadi perhiasan setiap pereka, menjadi keinginan si dara jelita, menjadi rebutan si putera raja... Setiap lirikan mata, Setiap gerak geri bicara, Ku perkemaskan tenunan, Ku halusi perasaan, Lalu,dengan perlahan redup matamu ku perhatikan, Lalu aku relakan... mereka istana pasir, dari embun-embun kasih.  - 3.4.2004                  tired...the whole day in school was spend in meetings. A friend of mine sms me saying that he had just came back from a short getaway. At first I was so relieved that he message me...then again. Believing in your feelings can really be difficult...especially when the other party does not feel the same way.To cross a friends path thats another issue...hmm,did some surfing on the net,discovered some beautiful poems.  This poem captured my heart,it goes on like this,  A Dream within a Dream by Edgar Allen Poe   Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem That my days have been a dream; Yet, if Hope has flown away In a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it, therefore, the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.  I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?  Been thinking of a certain someone that I really like...once upon a time. When everything was so  colourful, the air was sweet, the trees were beautiful...hmm.Thinking that it was meant to last forever n ever. Indeed, it only existed in fairy tales.True enough.                 Yesterday, the 4 of us went to Bukit Batok, me, my sis, ayu n hanip. We went to meet Keris, they were feeling kinda of down. Pity them. After that, we went and have a drink at Mas Ayu wif the other Kelana guys. Hmm...ayu cracking jokes about Talib, all the way from Bukit Batok to Mas Ayu. We were out control...giggling and laughing our hearts out throughout the journey. Irony.  I woke up late this morning. Marking my karangan...the neverending ordeal. After this, Im suppose to meet my P6EM3. I just realise how happy I am. although Im shoudering a lot of responsibilities.   The other day, my sis saw Khai, presuming with his wife. Hmm...life, what can I say. Yet, the bigger picture is, trust, guys and marriage. Marriage is a huge responsibility... a commitment. Nevertheless, when to think of it back, everything make sense. Maybe, it was a good thing in getting to know him, yup...he hurt me, but if we were to look at it at another perspective, he had hurt his partner even more, the trust. Me, being the third party. Retribution, I do not want to see it coming. I love my dear Hanip so much. Even to think of it, will make me sick. Then again, if it is meant to be...then be it. In life we have to be strong in tackling problem. It can be him and it can be me. He told me,  feelings can change, which is terribly true.     2.55 pm   Just finish cutting the tickets, the alignment has gone haywired. Ismail has been bugging me on the tickets. Hmm...Im searching for the C.C chop, I misplaced it , somehow. Im tired. My eyes are tired. Im tired. Ismail asked me whether they can use the mirror room. I try to see what I can do.    5.55 pm  Hmm...at de spur of moments, things can change. Now, Im feeling restless. Sad.   ' Which is one is better, 3 years or one n a half year...'  I think it is better if it is 3 years, then I won't be leaving in denial.  An everlasting commitment... ' the person can be me or you...' it can be Me or you...  &nbsp;     Kris Dayanti & Ajai          After reading my previous post, it lead me to think, saya ni orangnya berjiwang-jiwang. Hmm...enough of that sweetness in the air, the cloud nine, the everlasting cotton wool and being dragged back to the ground. Yesterday was the MAEC meeting, yup...we are going to have the gigantic group around...its not confimed yet but then again the glitters that we see in their eyes...can outshine the indoor stadium,hmm,im just exaggerating huh..     My sis and I decided to stay on because of these words...' We wont be in the CC, without you guys around,' hmm...so touched by what my dear bro Ayu had to say. And again we decided to stay on because of our dear ...Mr Zahidi Rahman, our supportive chairman. He actually begged us to stay. Thus,this year the first project is sponsored by the Heritage Centre with the help of us the MAEC.  Yup...the outlining of the budget, the Arts, and the most important thing the objective. For Mega Perdana...I don't really care. Mega Perdana had already been auction for the mere of $5,000. The so called Chairman is responsible for this.   Therefore, Singapore expect the next ala Gentarasa or even a bigger event to be truly organised by MAEC Siglap South and the Giants... Yesterday, Rizal called, he told me to write lyrics for the group. The theme, hmmm...something to do with Paruh... belum berilham hamba...  13 days to go, Khai. : )   'Love is not a matter of counting the years... it's making the years count.  --Wolfman Jack Smith                 yesterday was a very tiring and long day...woke up late to school. Hmm...had our Malam Anugerah Dikir 2004 penilaian...everyone was there.The emotional part was seeing them,the so called ' orang lama of the dikir barat world ' together after long years apart. Today,got an email... procedures on the registration to enrol on a degree programme in UM .still thinking,got the green light from my family.hmm...maybe I should enrol,there's nothing much left for me here,macam sedih gitukan... My friend told me, have you ever heard of the story about the Science teacher and her jar, the science teacher,put a few golf ball inside the jar,still its not full,the she put in some pebbles,followed by sand and the water. Then she said, in life we have to priorities,who are the golf balls,who symbolizes the sands and so on and so forth.The golf balls are people that are dear to you,people who meant a lot to you,the sand and the water symbolizes the so not important people,those that you can live without.Look here she said,you have to put the golf balls first,not the sand or the water.If you were to put the water first,you cannot put your golf balls...put the golfballs,then the pebbles,then the sand...then the water,you have to know. True...my families are my golf balls...the people that are dear to you.A friend told me that I kept making these stupid mistakes due to the fact that Im lonely, ehheheeh..more of a pathetic twisted personality. Now,Im a bit focus,confident tak tau asal...mungkin dah penat...mungkin. Adakah yang benar itu benar...tidak benar.                    Im hurting again...that's the irony part,I don't know why I am feeling this way. I can feel my heart bleeding thou...its happening again.Yup...as if a knife,slowly piercing deep through me. Yesterday, I went out with him and he brought up the issue of one of the gerl's group. I was so pissed off... yup... I totally lose control and the worse part, it was only like  30%  of my anger... bursting...it was not a full blast,then again.. it did make an impact.I kind of settled in when he crack some jokes about the boriah tingy...hmm,he is sweet...very sweet.  Guess what...7 new messages.Hmm...so many people I've blocked from my msn.Missed chatting with Shariffah aka yan, been busy lately...hmmm...  Again, let us analyse what the hell am I suffering from...is it an infectious or contagious disease...heheheeh, maybe I need to rest for another month or was it a pure act of jealousy..nah,that would be the last thing.... then again, maybe if you love the person too much, I would just like to imagine him being wrapped up neatly,in a package,put it in my closet,far away from all the girls as possible.At one point,I tend to become restless,twitchy and uneasy when he mentioned to me about his x.Im not a paranoid.To look at my past, I do have loads of Xs but then was then. Perhaps,Ive never been ditch before.The feeling must be overwhelming.Hmm...sad to say this,I think he still loves his x...that's it!! I couldn't sleep because I think he has feelings for his x. I feel terrible now...inferiority lurkes again. What a jughead, how can I not see this.. thats why I am feeling miserable..it has nothing to do with that masked man... Shucks...hmmm...jiwa retak pulak saya ni... Hai...how love can makes you a desperado and defy the norms.merepeknyelah saya...: ) Im listening to... Ada Apa Dengan Cinta...apa nak jadi hafidah,yeah...away feminisme and what is left of it...                     Guess what...a fren of mine by the name of Zai called, he hated when I call him that, the kelkatu man.heheeh,hmm...he sounded suprise. He asked me, ' Do you know that .....in your CC,' I said ' Yeah,Ive discussed it with Ayu,' The matter of the fact was, I dont really care...I mean the C.C stuff and more...Im in cloud nine you see and the only thing I can think off when Im marking and stuff like that is to think about my dear Khai in Taiwan.Has he eaten,taken his bath or the most important thing does he look at the stars every night and think of me, like I think of him.ehehhe.    The irony part here, is that Ive known him...what like nearly two months perhaps and the impact he gave me.I have to admit, the first time I met him,it was a mutual thing, a fren thing, like I meet my other frens. Then goes on to the next meeting plus the hours we hang on the phone.hmm...kita boleh bergayut berjam-jam.  Seldom people can just have the same chemistry bonding with me and the one that I want to be with is not just any Tom, Dick or Harry, he must be confident but at the same time humble... Any Tom, Dick or Harry can be found anywhere,under the drain,clubhouses,brushing their ego or just looking at themselves in the mirror and telling it straight to their face that they are big time losers.   Being in a relationship is not just uttering a few words like  I love you  or  I want you  , being true to each other,and to truly feel at lost when the other party is not around. Nevertheless,his picture or his last words somehow cure the emptiness inside.  I don't understand on how sometimes relationship is build on  a stupid lie. To be truthful is a responsibility to the loved ones.When you commit to someone, you don't only give your words...its more than that.     Something to digest ....Les Brown - I believe there are three kinds of people. There are winners, who know what they want and understand their potential and the possibilities. They take life on. Next are losers, who don't have a clue as to who they are. They allow circumstances to shape their lives and their self-image. I believe there is a third group as well. This consists of potential winners whose lives are just slightly out of alignment. I call them wayward winners...",
            "Hmm...my heart's been in Stockbridge for about 10 years now.  When I first got here from Riverdale, I'll admit, I had a good cry. Missing my old family and friends really hit me hard.  But my parents, they wanted the best for me and my little sister. A better place to live, a better school...you know, like they always say, \"a step up from the ghetto.\"  I guess over time, I got used to it all. Made some new friends, some people who just rubbed me the wrong way. I never really got close to the neighbors though, except for Mr. Glen and his kids.  And Dennis for a little while. They're like family to me, I'm really grateful for them.\n\nRemember that time we went to Mr. Glen's wedding?  He and Ms. Veda tied the knot again. It was a blast!  I caught the little white strap she took off her leg, but I missed the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I had a real good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing great!\n\nThis neighborhood can be a bit of a puzzle, but with my GPS, I'm exploring more. Mostly, I hang out with my buddies Kason and Curtis.  We used to be glued to the video games, just living it up. Sometimes I'd head to the park, just to soak up some nature. It really calms me down.  Makes me feel at peace. I might bring some sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, maybe even my bokken if I can. It's just fun to do the things I love.  \n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court there too, even though I haven't touched a racket or a ball in ages.  Still nice to have around, you know, just in case I feel like playing again. My dad and Mr. Graves, they really got me and my best friend hooked on tennis back in the day. We had a blast! They pushed us hard, but it was always fun.\n\nThere are so many good times here, so many stories.  These are just the ones that really stick with me.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is just a hop, skip and a jump from my college, which is super convenient.  Most of the buildings are apartments, but there are a few restaurants and bars sprinkled around that are fun to hang out at without breaking the bank. One bar just got a fancy new name, but it's a bit pricier now.  The drinks aren't bad, but the service is kind of meh.  Mostly, you'll find college kids and folks who are on a tight budget living here,  since the apartments aren't too expensive. There are a ton of kids around too because there's an elementary school just a stone's throw away.  I don't really know my neighbors, and honestly, I'm kinda okay with that. They have a bit of a penchant for marijuana, so the building management put one of those air freshener things right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I thought was hilarious - kinda rude, but funny.  \n\nThe buildings around here are a bit old-fashioned, though some have been spruced up inside.  Down the street, there are these brand new apartment buildings, but I'm not a fan.  They feel kinda cheap and flimsy, but the rent is super high - a total rip-off, in my opinion.  I guess they can get away with it because they're close to campus. \n\nThere's this super cheap eats place just five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates. Everything is microwaved, but hey, it gets the job done.  Across the street is a gas station that doesn't have a great reputation.  But last summer, they redid the road with city money, so now there's a nice wide sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area is looking a bit nicer.  My apartment building is tucked away behind some trees, though they did chop down a few. I guess they're trying to open things up. \n\nBehind my complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind is 43rd Street, and it's not as charming.  The sidewalks are crumbling, and most of the buildings look pretty rough around the edges. There are a lot of trees there too, probably to hide the not-so-pretty buildings. There's been a lot of crime in that area, mostly at one particular apartment complex, though it's not fair to blame them alone.  The apartments across the street from me are also a bit sketchy with a lot of turnover. \n\nOverall, though, I kinda like where I live. It's affordable, and I have everything I need nearby.  The best part is that my college is just a walk away, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood feels like a little slice of old-fashioned charm. It's made up of these cute duplexes, all tucked away on a quiet cul-de-sac. They're spaced out just enough so they look like individual houses, and they all have this sweet, matching look with their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs.  Most of the folks here are friends, and we often gather at the end of the driveways in the evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's so nice to have that sense of community, especially in this crazy, tech-driven world. It feels like stepping back in time.\n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees, with big blue skies and fluffy white clouds. It's picture-perfect, really.  The only downside lately has been the tornado warnings. Last night, we actually heard the sirens! So, there I was, tucked away in my bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows, just in case. My big dog wasn't as keen on the bathroom idea and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The whole neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail pounding on everything. It was pretty intense.  \n\nAfter the storm, the road seemed to be steaming from the temperature change. It went from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes! The hail melted instantly as it hit the hot pavement. As the clouds cleared, the sun came out and started pouring rain. And then, the most amazing thing happened: a double rainbow! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were just as awestruck as I was.\n\nThings calmed down after an hour or so, and people started trickling back home. It was back to normal pretty quickly - moms and kids out playing, dinner cooking.  It's a really friendly neighborhood, and I love it here.  \n\nI live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else.  They all look the same on the outside, but the insides are different. Some are surprisingly small, which I don't quite understand.  I love taking walks in the big field behind my place and heading down to the pond. It's not for swimming, but it's a great spot to see deer. In the morning, you can hear this giant bullfrog singing his heart out. It's a fantastic place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte.  \n\nEvery morning, we're greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like living in a little village. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that bray's in the evenings, letting us know he's around. I feel so lucky to have found this special place.",
            "Hmm...moving to this new place was right around the time I started eighth grade.  Making friends was tough at first, you know? But then I met this awesome guy who lives just two houses down, and another cool dude on my street.  They've moved on since then, but the memories are still there, like little treasures tucked away. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still around, just like those familiar faces in a favorite song.  It's a pretty typical neighborhood, like so many others you see in those movies, full of two-story houses and the sound of kids laughing and playing outside whenever the weather's nice. It's pretty quiet most days, which is kind of nice.\n\nI've never had any trouble with anyone here. People keep to themselves, which is cool.  You're left alone unless you need something, like if you need help moving a heavy box or something.  I've ordered a bunch of stuff online, and not once has anything gone missing from my porch.  It makes me feel safe, knowing I can trust the people around me.\n\nThere's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my house. We've got so many memories there, me and the guys.  We used to play basketball, football, even baseball.  I even got whacked in the nose playing football, which wasn't so fun, but hey, those good times definitely outweigh the bad ones. Now, when I go there, it's mostly to hang out with my cousins' kids. They're little, still into swings and slides and all that. Just thinking about going to the park makes their eyes light up, which is so sweet.  It brings back a whole lot of memories, you know?\n\nThe neighborhood's pretty diverse, which is awesome. You can find all kinds of food around here.  Within just a mile, you've got Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – everything! But these days, everyone seems to be ordering in with those apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.  The usual fast food places are everywhere, and there's always a pizza place on every corner.  \n\nThere are tons of stores, too, with everything you could possibly need.  Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, even a Jewel-Osco grocery store – it's like a mini-city! There's even an Indian store if you're in the mood for some homemade curry or ready-made samosas.\n\nLooking at what other people go through in their neighborhoods, it makes me really appreciate this place. It's a haven, a little slice of peace. I'm grateful to call it home.",
            "My town, Johnston, is a little slice of Southern charm, nestled in the heart of South Carolina. It might not be the flashiest place around, but it's got a special place in my heart, especially when it comes to peaches. You see, Johnston proudly wears the crown of \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title you'll see proudly displayed on the welcome sign.  \n\nEverywhere you look, it's a sea of green, dotted with peach trees and cattle pastures. The houses are mostly spread out, with two-story beauties sporting either metal roofs to beat the summer heat or classic gray shingles. They often sit back from the road, leaving plenty of space for fields and farm animals.\n\nThe heart of town is centered around a single, lonely stoplight at a four-way intersection. It's here you'll find the town's only stores, a testament to its small-town vibe. For a quick bite, you can choose from Hong Kong, a cozy Chinese joint run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a familiar burger chain. We used to have a pizza place, but it sadly closed up shop a while back. \n\nThere's a tiny, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for their delicious Cherry Coca-Cola. Then there's the Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), a bit pricey but the only grocery store for miles around. Most folks prefer to make the trip to Batesburg-Leesville for their weekly shopping spree at Walmart, though. \n\nThe real star of the show is hands down Dollar General. You can find everything you need there, and it's always bustling from opening to closing. There's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a sweet little shop run by a beloved local lady. They've been around forever and even offer delivery with their own movers! Tucked behind the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a full-service pet groomer with daycare and boarding options. \n\nBoth the doctor's office and the veterinary clinic are a bit off the beaten path, but they're well-equipped to take care of the townspeople. \n\nOur only elementary school is Johnston Elementary, but once kids finish fifth grade, they have to head to the next town over for middle and high school.  \n\nParks? Not so much. We're working on a 2.5-acre recreation area to give families a place to hang out and maybe lure in some new residents. But honestly, Johnston isn't exactly a bustling metropolis. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or trendy spots to hang. It's so small, you could practically drive through it without even noticing!  \n\nBut that's the charm of Johnston. It's a quiet, friendly place where everyone knows everyone, and life moves at a slower pace. It may not be flashy, but it's home.",
            "My ears first heard whispers of this place while listening to a podcast about vanished souls. It was a bit of a shocker, really. Every apartment around here goes for over a thousand dollars a month, you know? I'd never heard a peep about any missing persons, and neither had any of my buddies. Maybe it's the struggle, the daily grind. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, worried about making ends meet. Things are pricey, but we've learned to be clever with our money over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty charm of second-hand toys and clothes that have seen better days. You lose that new car smell pretty fast in adulthood. Maybe you pick up a habit like smoking, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But the flea market, oh, that place always calls back to you. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, clinging to the leather even after a good wash.   \n\nThere are three thrift stores within walking distance here. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and a quirky little curio shop. Downtown is bustling, cars and people pouring into the streets every morning, but those thrift stores? They're peaceful sanctuaries. No matter how many people or cars go by, the inside is quiet. It's a perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon. Every year, more and more people and cars seem to flood in. They say it's a developing city, growing pains and all. It reminds me a bit of New York, actually. Everyone here is focused on their own goals, and no one really expects much from you. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like back home, where showing a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into your life, not really. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city just keeps rolling on like waves on the beach. \n\nIt's a vibrant place to be, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we're less like strangers in an apartment building and more like a community of friends. We come together when we need to, for birthdays, funerals, to help each other out. I feel lucky to be here, truthfully. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them a little treat now and then, and they do the same for me. We bring each other mail, lend a hand when needed. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. \n\nI live in this massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "My neighbourhood, well, it's like a picture postcard of suburbia, you know?  Everything's so... neat.  The homeowner's association, they're like the invisible hand making sure everything's just so. Every house looks pretty much the same - a little patch of grass, some fancy rocks, a short driveway, maybe a little tree here and there.  And, of course, every house has a two-car garage. The roads are spotless, not a pothole in sight, all freshly paved.  Most are single-story, but you'll find some two-story ones sprinkled in.  \n\nNow, about the mailboxes -  they're not your typical kind. No individual boxes out front, no sir. It's more like an apartment building, a whole cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street. And there are these big lockers for packages too. Gotta love that HOA love for uniformity. \n\nSince my house sits on the edge of the city, our neighborhood's kind of a mix of country and suburb. We've got tons of space! There are community pools, all fancy and gated, and walking trails where you can take your dog or just go for a peaceful stroll. No need to go to a park for some exercise, you can just run around the neighborhood and get a good workout. \n\nMost folks here are retired, it's a really safe place, everyone looks out for each other. But there are some middle-aged and young professionals sprinkled in too. \n\nThe city itself is a bit of a paradox -  huge by population, but still feels small town cozy.  We've got most of the things you need, like that one mall - not huge, but it does the trick.  It's about a 15-minute drive to get anywhere interesting, but once you get there, there are tons of stores to choose from - fancy organic grocery stores, bargain outlets with just a handful of things and barely any staff... you name it. \n\nSo yeah, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, pretty typical, really.  We've got our community things like pools and trails, and while we're not right next to shopping, it's just a quick drive to anything you could want.",
            "My little corner of the world is a small town, just outside the big city buzz. It feels kinda like everyone knows each other here.  My street, on the east side, it's where the folks who don't have much money live. The houses are older, and most folks are renting. But you know what? It's not bad.  My neighbors, they're like family. Always a friendly wave and a hello when we pass each other.  Things happen, sometimes things get rough, but it's not like it's a scary place. There's been some drama, a few bad things, like shootings and stuff.  Our neighbors next door, they lost their boy last year.  It was heartbreaking.  Luckily, nothing too bad has ever happened to us directly.  Maybe something goes missing from the porch now and then, but that's about it.\n\nThis whole town, it's been hit hard by those \"opioid\" problems you hear about.  It's sad, folks losing their lives to that stuff. But there are good people here. They're trying to help. There are places where folks can get help with addiction, and folks are learning how to use that Narcan thing to save lives.  It's a tough situation, but people are trying.\n\nThere are a lot of good things here too. My son, he goes to a great school. The teachers and everyone there, they're amazing.  He's got special needs, but no one has ever bothered him. The school is so positive, he loves it there. We've got a strong parent group that always has fun events going on.  \n\nBecause so many families here struggle, the school makes sure every kid gets breakfast and lunch for free. No one ever has to worry about going hungry.  They don't judge anyone for not having a lot of money.  School stuff is also really affordable.  \n\nThe city folks have been working hard to make things look nicer.  They've fixed up the roads, planted flowers, and spruced up the parks.  But mostly, they've been focusing on the center of town, where the stores and restaurants are.  My side of town, it seems like it gets left behind sometimes.  That's a bummer, but I still like it here.  \n\nWe've been here for over 16 years. Our house isn't fancy, but it's home.  The people are kind, the schools are great, we've got everything we need, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a place with a story, ya know? Perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of times gone by. I live in a seven-story apartment building, right across from an old theater, its curtain still waiting for its next act. Just down the street, a cool little arcade bar draws in all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Come June and July, especially on weekends, you'll see a line stretching out the door, just buzzing with anticipation. A few blocks up, there's a city park, a green haven in the heart of it all. It's a decent size for this part of town, surrounded by concrete and these tall, sturdy stairs built right into the wall. In the winter, when the cold bites deep and the rain comes pouring down, you see them - folks without homes, setting up their tents in neat little rows along the sidewalk and those wide steps. They huddle close, seeking warmth in numbers,  closer to the city center than the wilderness. It's not far to the family center, either, where they can find a hot shower and a moment of peace.  But what I love most about this place, it's not the history etched into the buildings, the proud structures reaching for the sky or the way the architecture spills down the hills towards the ocean. No, it's the people. You see, Hilltop, once known as the most dangerous place on the West Coast, still carries the weight of its past. Stories linger, whispers passed down through generations, even three decades later, of the feds and the DEA sweeping through, trying to cleanse the streets. The people remember. \n\nThey work hard, even though folks still whisper about the rough edges of Hilltop. They care about their corner of the world, about keeping it clean, about keeping it theirs. Some folks say, \"Don't walk around Hilltop after dark if you're white,\" but I think that's just a shadow of the old days, a lingering echo of fear and prejudice. Maybe it's because I walk with a shade that blends in, or maybe Hilltop sees a kindred spirit in me, someone who knows the sting of prejudice, the weight of assumptions.  I know one thing: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. The streets pulse with a life that makes me feel alive. I've walked those streets in the dark, met people who'd offer me a jacket before they'd think to rob me. The laundromat owner left her store open late so I could charge my phone when the rain trapped me outside.  On the coldest nights, huddled in the shadow of a shop front, I felt invisible until someone stopped, looked me in the eye, and handed me five dollars, whispering, \"You're beautiful, you're valuable.\"  Hilltop is a place where kindness is a language everyone understands.",
            "My life unfolds in the heart of rural America, nestled amidst  the rolling farmland and charming tourist towns of small-town Michigan. It's a place where you won't find the bustling energy of big city malls, the familiar giants like Walmart or Target, or even a casual dining spot like Applebee's. Everything requires a little drive, a journey that takes you through the picturesque landscape.  But despite the lack of urban conveniences, I live in a slice of paradise, surrounded by the shimmering allure of water. My little town is cradled between the majestic Lake Michigan and the serene beauty of Lake Charlevoix. Every direction you turn, you'll find a beach beckoning you to dip your toes into its cool embrace.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the true spirit of small-town living. Houses stand proudly, each with its own unique story, some boasting updated interiors while others retain their vintage charm. Basements, the kind you can peek into from the street, are a common sight, and the houses wear their colorful aluminum siding like badges of honor.  Here, you'll find a kaleidoscope of colors adorning the blocks, a testament to the individuality of its residents. Most homes have yards, spaces where children's laughter echoes as they bounce on trampolines or swing on playsets. Gardens bloom with vibrant flowers, and fences enclose furry companions, creating a tapestry of life and family. \n\nIt's a neighborhood that reflects the heart of Middle America, a place where hard-working folks strive to build a life for themselves and their families. The streets are alive with the joyful sounds of children playing, dogs barking, and the rhythmic whir of bikes and rollerblades. The sense of community is tangible; neighbors greet each other with waves and smiles, forming a network of support and familiarity.  \n\nThe lawns are meticulously maintained, free from the clutter of fallen leaves and boasting emerald green grass.  Gardens are meticulously pruned, and bushes are trimmed to perfection, creating an atmosphere of order and care. This isn't a neighborhood that boasts ostentatious mansions, but a place that whispers, \"welcome home.\" It's a haven where families feel safe and secure, a place to put down roots and watch your children grow.\n\nJust a stone's throw away, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, a symbol of security and order.  The Health department is a close neighbor, ensuring the well-being of the community.  The recycling center stands ready to serve the needs of residents. \n\nThe sound of baseball games fills the air as children and adults alike enjoy the thrill of the game. Nearby, the small town airport hums with activity, the rumble of planes taking off and landing a constant reminder of the world beyond.  A local ice cream parlor beckons with its sweet aroma, and a short stroll takes you to the heart of downtown.  My children can ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away, where they can spend hours of carefree joy."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My city is a real melting pot, you know? It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle with all these different pieces fitting together in a crazy way.  Living here is like being on a never-ending adventure. You've got your residential pockets scattered all over the place, tucked in between shops and restaurants and offices.  It's like a feast for the senses, with new places popping up all the time. \n\nWe've got those big, fancy stores that everyone knows, but then there are these hidden gems, these little boutiques that just make you want to pop in. They're everywhere, even on quiet streets you wouldn't expect, adding a touch of magic to the everyday.  And don't even get me started on the parks! They're always filled with families, kids running around, having fun. It's heartwarming to see. \n\nSpeaking of diverse, this place is bursting with different cultures.  Right here in my neighborhood, you've got your LGBTQ+ folks, a tight-knit Orthodox Jewish community, and even folks who have made their way here from the old Soviet Union. It's like a little world within a world.  \n\nAnd if you venture a little further out, you'll find even more communities, like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia... they're all just a stone's throw away, but sometimes getting there feels like a journey. Traffic can be a nightmare, especially during rush hour.  You can drive for miles and miles, but it might only take you a few blocks.\n\nIt's funny, though, because even with all this traffic, everyone seems to be adding more buildings to the city.  New apartment blocks are springing up everywhere, but some people are starting to worry that it's getting too crowded.\n\nBut hey, there's something for everyone here. You've got your big apartment buildings, your cozy houses, even duplexes.  It's all mixed up, just like the people who live here.\n\nI've lived here my whole life, but I still feel like I'm constantly meeting new people.  It's not exactly a tight-knit community anymore, but that's okay. It's still exciting, always something new to discover. Maybe that's the beauty of city life, always keeping you on your toes.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a quirky little slice of America, ya know? Most of the houses are like those classic single-family ones, but some folks split 'em up, making two homes out of one, still attached like twins. My place has got a little patch of grass out front and a teeny driveway, just enough for one car. It's like a picture postcard from a bygone era, back when the American dream meant living in the suburbs.  Back then, it felt like everyone was chasing that dream, but now, it's like the dream's drifting away, getting harder to hold onto. \n\nBut my neighborhood, it's still holding strong, whispering that the dream's still out there, just gotta keep reachin' for it. Folks ain't as hopeful as they used to be, the lawns ain't as manicured, but you still see a couple cars in most driveways, and the kids, they're running wild, like the world's their playground. There's this old school, been around for nigh on 90 years, still standing tall, givin' kids a glimpse of the future, while the old folks reminisce about their own school days.

Tried to get an exit, young folks wanted it, but the old-timers said it'd ruin our town. They got their way, kept things just the way they were.

Quiet as a mouse, it is, with students shuffling in, coffee in hand, yawning like it's the end of the world at seven in the morning.

            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the endless cornfields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she wouldn't believe how simple and open everything was. She was used to living in a town where everything was just a short walk away, she'd never seen this much space in her life. Overwhelmed by all the corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we continued down this two-lane country road, we came to a quarry filled with water.

My sister and I used to fight a lot when we were kids, and in the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice.

            "Hmm...let me tell you about Portland, Oregon, this place with a unique kind of \"weirdness\". You'll see it everywhere, even on the side of a building that's part pizza joint, part bar, part music venue, part strip club...you get the picture.  They say \"Keep Portland Weird\" there, like it's a promise.  Some folks, they remember the old Portland, back when it was still hidden away and affordable. That's the Portland that birthed all the creative, quirky subcultures. Others, well, they see it as an invitation - come to Portland, where being different is a good thing, something to celebrate.  Even with all those fancy Californians moving in and those shiny new condos popping up everywhere, Portland still holds onto that weirdness.\n\nBut what exactly does \"weird\" mean here? It's not about being totally accepting of everything, no. It's about accepting the things that might make others raise an eyebrow. It's about knowing that we still have all the modern conveniences and the same everyday struggles as anywhere else. Sure, we buy most of our stuff from China, just like everyone else. There are a million ways to be different, to not fit in, and Portland has plenty of those. \n\nYou'll find yoga studios, hipsters, and suits working in offices here, just like anywhere else. Maybe \"weird\" just means we take it all a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, and in lots of others, you'll see houses painted in all sorts of bright colors, gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and even free boxes lining the sidewalks. These boxes, well, they're a Portland tradition. They're filled with treasures - clothes, books, sometimes even something completely unexpected. It's like a little surprise waiting for you around every corner.  \n\nThat magical feeling of discovering something special in the most ordinary places, that's what Portland is all about to me. At least, that's my version of weird. I know there are thousands of other kinds of weird here. Some folks wouldn't dream of taking anything out of a box on the street. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yes, you read that right!) or cheer on the Timbers soccer team. Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things, dream big, or at least dream about dreaming big while sipping a pint at the local pub. \n\nWe're not perfect, though. Like anywhere else, we have our struggles. Portland has a drug problem, and it's hard not to see the connection between that and the mental health issues that often go hand in hand. The constant rain and gray skies probably don't help either. And then there's the issue of homelessness, a problem that seems to plague every city. Portland tries to help, but our programs aren't enough.  Some people here are compassionate, while others just give up hope. Honestly, that's not so weird, is it? It's just part of being human.",
            "The mountains, they've always been there, like silent guardians watching over everything. Northward, they stand tall, witnessing every sunrise and sunset, unmoved by the hustle and bustle of life. Even when I'm caught up in my studies or work, they're still there, solid and unwavering. On days when stress weighs heavy on me, they seem to call out, demanding to be seen. And when I turn to them, they offer a calming presence, a source of strength to carry on, one day at a time.\n\nIt all started when I first moved here for university. The mountains north of campus captured my heart immediately. The university itself has its own beauty – the buildings, the ponds, the trees – each holding a special place in my memory. But the mountains, they rule them all.  \n\nThe town itself is a charming mix of the familiar and the unexpected. There are countless cafes where I spent countless hours fueled by coffee and late-night study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where faded brick buildings whisper stories of a bygone era. It's here that the town pulses with a vibrant energy, almost as if it's trying to outshine its bustling city neighbor. But just a few blocks away, you can escape back to the peaceful charm of small-town life, passing by the library on your way. This beautiful contrast, this close proximity of two distinct atmospheres, gives the town a magical quality, inviting you to explore its every nook and cranny.\n\nIt's a town where memories are made, both cherished and bittersweet. There's the rusty swing set in the park, where friends and I would congregate after all-nighters, or the frantic dash through the downtown area to catch a movie at the fancy theater thanks to a student discount. But like all places, it holds its share of painful memories too. The ponds, especially, seem to be a magnet for introspection and tearful confessions at 2 a.m. during existential crises – an experience I've had more times than I care to admit.\n\nWhile watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each with their own purpose, I couldn't help but question my own path. I walked past the pond, the park, the houses that screamed suburbia, until I found myself on a main street. As I walked, the sun bathed the palm trees in its golden light, painting the sky with vibrant hues. Looking up, I realized I was heading north. And there they were, as steadfast as ever. The mountains, majestically towering above everything else, their presence a silent reminder of my own strength and perseverance.",

Getting around is a breeze, especially with the awesome public transportation, you know, one of the big things in New York City.  Bensonhurst has a real city vibe, so you'll be smack-dab in the heart of it all.  \n\nAnd speaking of vibes, get ready for a real sensory experience! You'll see these amazing Asian stores everywhere you look. In the last twenty years or so, Bensonhurst has become a real melting pot, especially with all the Asian folks moving in.  It's like every block has an Asian-owned store, you'll be spoiled for choice! Supermarkets and laundromats seem to be the most popular, and they're a hit with everyone, not just the Asian community. The food in the supermarkets is top-notch, the prices are super reasonable, and let's be honest, it's just so darn convenient. I mean, I live right near a cluster of four Asian supermarkets, all within a couple of minutes walking distance! Talk about convenience!\n\nBut don't think Bensonhurst is all about one culture, oh no! It's a real mix of people, with immigrants, and their kids who are first and second generation Americans, all living together.  While most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, there's a cool new park nearby that's got something for everyone. Ten basketball courts, a huge field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for the little ones, even a water fountain to cool off in the summer. It's a true melting pot, with people from all walks of life hanging out and getting along.\n\nAs for buildings, you won't find too many big, corporate towers here. Mostly, it's co-op buildings and condos. The majority of peeps live in these cute two-family houses, though.  The people here are generally nice, but can be a bit noisy, if you catch my drift.  Cars blasting music as they drive by,  people revving their engines in the morning...it can wake you right up! If you're planning to be out at night, keep your wits about you.  Bensonhurst is pretty safe, but you never know when you might run into some troublemakers, bullies, or even thieves. I've been through some things here myself, a few run-ins in the past, nothing too bad, but it's good to be aware. \n\nAnother thing, there's been a bit of a package theft problem lately.  Not a good look, right?  And while New York City has rules about cleaning up after your dog, some folks don't seem to get the memo.  Every morning, you'll probably see at least one piece of dog waste on your way to the train or the supermarket.  It's a real pet peeve of mine, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood is a peculiar place, perched precariously on the highest hill in town. People call it the \"workout hill\" because all the runners love to challenge themselves with its steep incline. The lack of sidewalks forces everyone to walk on the road, which is cracked and uneven in spots, making it a bit of a bumpy ride. The power lines strung across the street tell a story of their own, tattered and patched together after countless encounters with falling branches and storms.  \n\nEverywhere you look, towering evergreen trees stand sentinel.  But here's the funny thing - folks around here despise them! They're always trying to chop them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are built high up on the hill, with giant second stories boasting glass walls, desperately trying to catch a glimpse of the bay.\n\nSunsets are breathtaking, though. The water shimmers like liquid gold, and the sky explodes in a blaze of orange. Most days, though, the clouds steal the show, shrouding everything in a soft, damp haze. Moss thrives in this dampness, clinging to roofs, cars, even railings. Once, I left my car parked for a month, and it emerged looking like a furry green monster - three hours of scrubbing later, it was finally clean.\n\nKids are a rare sight in our neighborhood.  There's a school just a few blocks away, but it's mostly populated by retired folks.  Dogs, on the other hand, are everywhere. You'll find them lounging on lawns, chasing each other down the street, or sometimes, even sneaking into your house if you leave a door open!  I once found one in my living room, patiently waiting for a treat.\n\nRabbits also roam freely, much to the annoyance of gardeners who find their burrows digging up precious plants. But my cats are thrilled, having hunted most of them out of our yard.  We also have our fair share of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle, who often get chased away by the resident crows.\n\nThere aren't any stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood.  The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can easily see the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "Hmm... life here is kinda like one of those slow-moving movies, you know?  I live on this little street in a sleepy town down south, kinda tucked between two busy highways.  So, we get our fair share of traffic, nothin' too wild though. It's a pretty quiet neighborhood, most folks here have lived here for ages, so we all know each other pretty well.  It's the kind of place where everyone's busy with their own thing - tending to their yards, running errands, that kinda stuff.   \n\nWe live on the corner, so we get a front-row seat to all the neighborhood action. We know all the cars that go by, and if somethin' new rolls up, well, we take notice.  Some folks like to take walks, others walk their dogs, and the kids, they're always whizzing around on their bikes.  \n\nMy wife and I work from home, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen, are always underfoot. We're pretty much homebodies, so everyone's used to seeing us come and go. We love to play outside, even when it's drizzling, and we'll fire up the grill on our back deck whenever we get the chance.  It's like an unspoken rule - you gotta smell that barbecue at least once a week! \n\nThere's nothin' but trees around here, it used to be all woods, so we've got plenty of shade, but that means a whole lot of leaves come Fall. Raking and burning leaves is practically a family tradition. That smoky smell just screams \"Autumn\" to me, you know?\n\nThis year, we haven't had much of a winter at all, just a long, drawn-out Fall.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we only use the front door for company, which isn't often.\n\nI like to tinker in the garage with my truck or other projects, and when the doors are open, I feel like I'm more connected to the whole neighborhood. Holidays are a little more lively - Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas - folks come visit and the street gets crowded with cars.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty good life here.  If it weren't for that through-street traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where it's dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably don't get it. Like, you just don't understand the feeling of seeing brown everywhere you look. And when you do see a lawn, you know that person is dropping serious cash on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first lived here, the houses were spread out like they were trying to escape each other. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a bunch of new places popping up. Honestly, it's starting to feel more like a city every day, but I guess that's happening everywhere, right?\n\nMost of the people here are really friendly, just like in any place, you have your ups and downs. But in my part of town, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so it's a pretty nice place to be.\n\nThe stores around here are mostly the chain kind, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for something upscale, you gotta drive a bit. Never see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here. \n\nBased on what I see, the biggest industry in town is construction. I think that's because the city is still growing. There are still tons of wide-open spaces waiting to be built on.  It kinda freaks me out, actually. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city, and I'm not looking to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living – drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nOne of the things I love about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert itself is definitely a big draw. The high desert climate and landscape have created some pretty amazing ecosystems that need protecting. We share this space with all sorts of awesome creatures, and it's important that we learn about them so we can live together peacefully.\n\nMy family and I have gotten pretty good at coexisting with the wildlife. I have three kids, and they're obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. They're out there right now, trying to catch all sorts of interesting critters.\n\nAs for things to do around here, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert in a different way.  If you're visiting, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a ton of fun, and it really captures the Victorville spirit.  \n\nYou can also head up to nearby Wrightwood to see the snowy mountains and even take a winter sports lesson. \n\nIf you're interested in learning about the history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit. They have all sorts of cool stuff – geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how Victorville came to be.",
            "Hmm...my heart n soui went to Taiwan last Thursday,on the 1st to be precise. Im going to miss him and it has only been a day and yet here I am looking at his photo... again and again as if the world is going to come tumbling down.  Yup...his job is kinda time constraining,him an officer in the army ... I have to live with that for the rest of my life. Yet, I am happy with him. There's chemistry and we could talk about anything from weapons,politics or even the simple terminology of self reflection. I feel safe with him...maybe he is my knight n shinning armour who  has come to save me amidst the confusion. He was so sweet,the day he called me before he flew off, he said ' In any decision that you are going to make, I will say yes to it all,I wiil support you and at the end of the day, I will always be there for you,' I almost cried when he said that, Ive been waiting for someone to tell me that.  Dear Khai,my knight and shinning armour, come back to me when your job is done...   Untukmu Khai  Untukmu Ku saluti benang-benang sutera, menjadi perhiasan setiap pereka, menjadi keinginan si dara jelita, menjadi rebutan si putera raja... Setiap lirikan mata, Setiap gerak geri bicara, Ku perkemaskan tenunan, Ku halusi perasaan, Lalu,dengan perlahan redup matamu ku perhatikan, Lalu aku relakan... mereka istana pasir, dari embun-embun kasih.  - 3.4.2004                  tired...the whole day in school was spend in meetings. A friend of mine sms me saying that he had just came back from a short getaway. At first I was so relieved that he message me...then again. Believing in your feelings can really be difficult...especially when the other party does not feel the same way.To cross a friends path thats another issue...hmm,did some surfing on the net,discovered some beautiful poems.  This poem captured my heart,it goes on like this,  A Dream within a Dream by Edgar Allen Poe   Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem That my days have been a dream; Yet, if Hope has flown away In a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it, therefore, the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.  I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?  Been thinking of a certain someone that I really like...once upon a time. When everything was so  colourful, the air was sweet, the trees were beautiful...hmm.Thinking that it was meant to last forever n ever. Indeed, it only existed in fairy tales.True enough.                 Yesterday, the 4 of us went to Bukit Batok, me, my sis, ayu n hanip. We went to meet Keris, they were feeling kinda of down. Pity them. After that, we went and have a drink at Mas Ayu wif the other Kelana guys. Hmm...ayu cracking jokes about Talib, all the way from Bukit Batok to Mas Ayu. We were out control...giggling and laughing our hearts out throughout the journey. Irony.  I woke up late this morning. Marking my karangan...the neverending ordeal. After this, Im suppose to meet my P6EM3. I just realise how happy I am. although Im shoudering a lot of responsibilities.   The other day, my sis saw Khai, presuming with his wife. Hmm...life, what can I say. Yet, the bigger picture is, trust, guys and marriage. Marriage is a huge responsibility... a commitment. Nevertheless, when to think of it back, everything make sense. Maybe, it was a good thing in getting to know him, yup...he hurt me, but if we were to look at it at another perspective, he had hurt his partner even more, the trust. Me, being the third party. Retribution, I do not want to see it coming. I love my dear Hanip so much. Even to think of it, will make me sick. Then again, if it is meant to be...then be it. In life we have to be strong in tackling problem. It can be him and it can be me. He told me,  feelings can change, which is terribly true.     2.55 pm   Just finish cutting the tickets, the alignment has gone haywired. Ismail has been bugging me on the tickets. Hmm...Im searching for the C.C chop, I misplaced it , somehow. Im tired. My eyes are tired. Im tired. Ismail asked me whether they can use the mirror room. I try to see what I can do.    5.55 pm  Hmm...at de spur of moments, things can change. Now, Im feeling restless. Sad.   ' Which is one is better, 3 years or one n a half year...'  I think it is better if it is 3 years, then I won't be leaving in denial.  An everlasting commitment... ' the person can be me or you...' it can be Me or you...  &nbsp;     Kris Dayanti & Ajai          After reading my previous post, it lead me to think, saya ni orangnya berjiwang-jiwang. Hmm...enough of that sweetness in the air, the cloud nine, the everlasting cotton wool and being dragged back to the ground. Yesterday was the MAEC meeting, yup...we are going to have the gigantic group around...its not confimed yet but then again the glitters that we see in their eyes...can outshine the indoor stadium,hmm,im just exaggerating huh..     My sis and I decided to stay on because of these words...' We wont be in the CC, without you guys around,' hmm...so touched by what my dear bro Ayu had to say. And again we decided to stay on because of our dear ...Mr Zahidi Rahman, our supportive chairman. He actually begged us to stay. Thus,this year the first project is sponsored by the Heritage Centre with the help of us the MAEC.  Yup...the outlining of the budget, the Arts, and the most important thing the objective. For Mega Perdana...I don't really care. Mega Perdana had already been auction for the mere of $5,000. The so called Chairman is responsible for this.   Therefore, Singapore expect the next ala Gentarasa or even a bigger event to be truly organised by MAEC Siglap South and the Giants... Yesterday, Rizal called, he told me to write lyrics for the group. The theme, hmmm...something to do with Paruh... belum berilham hamba...  13 days to go, Khai. : )   'Love is not a matter of counting the years... it's making the years count.  --Wolfman Jack Smith                 yesterday was a very tiring and long day...woke up late to school. Hmm...had our Malam Anugerah Dikir 2004 penilaian...everyone was there.The emotional part was seeing them,the so called ' orang lama of the dikir barat world ' together after long years apart. Today,got an email... procedures on the registration to enrol on a degree programme in UM .still thinking,got the green light from my family.hmm...maybe I should enrol,there's nothing much left for me here,macam sedih gitukan... My friend told me, have you ever heard of the story about the Science teacher and her jar, the science teacher,put a few golf ball inside the jar,still its not full,the she put in some pebbles,followed by sand and the water. Then she said, in life we have to priorities,who are the golf balls,who symbolizes the sands and so on and so forth.The golf balls are people that are dear to you,people who meant a lot to you,the sand and the water symbolizes the so not important people,those that you can live without.Look here she said,you have to put the golf balls first,not the sand or the water.If you were to put the water first,you cannot put your golf balls...put the golfballs,then the pebbles,then the sand...then the water,you have to know. True...my families are my golf balls...the people that are dear to you.A friend told me that I kept making these stupid mistakes due to the fact that Im lonely, ehheheeh..more of a pathetic twisted personality. Now,Im a bit focus,confident tak tau asal...mungkin dah penat...mungkin. Adakah yang benar itu benar...tidak benar.                    Im hurting again...that's the irony part,I don't know why I am feeling this way. I can feel my heart bleeding thou...its happening again.Yup...as if a knife,slowly piercing deep through me. Yesterday, I went out with him and he brought up the issue of one of the gerl's group. I was so pissed off... yup... I totally lose control and the worse part, it was only like  30%  of my anger... bursting...it was not a full blast,then again.. it did make an impact.I kind of settled in when he crack some jokes about the boriah tingy...hmm,he is sweet...very sweet.  Guess what...7 new messages.Hmm...so many people I've blocked from my msn.Missed chatting with Shariffah aka yan, been busy lately...hmmm...  Again, let us analyse what the hell am I suffering from...is it an infectious or contagious disease...heheheeh, maybe I need to rest for another month or was it a pure act of jealousy..nah,that would be the last thing.... then again, maybe if you love the person too much, I would just like to imagine him being wrapped up neatly,in a package,put it in my closet,far away from all the girls as possible.At one point,I tend to become restless,twitchy and uneasy when he mentioned to me about his x.Im not a paranoid.To look at my past, I do have loads of Xs but then was then. Perhaps,Ive never been ditch before.The feeling must be overwhelming.Hmm...sad to say this,I think he still loves his x...that's it!! I couldn't sleep because I think he has feelings for his x. I feel terrible now...inferiority lurkes again. What a jughead, how can I not see this.. thats why I am feeling miserable..it has nothing to do with that masked man... Shucks...hmmm...jiwa retak pulak saya ni... Hai...how love can makes you a desperado and defy the norms.merepeknyelah saya...: ) Im listening to... Ada Apa Dengan Cinta...apa nak jadi hafidah,yeah...away feminisme and what is left of it...                     Guess what...a fren of mine by the name of Zai called, he hated when I call him that, the kelkatu man.heheeh,hmm...he sounded suprise. He asked me, ' Do you know that .....in your CC,' I said ' Yeah,Ive discussed it with Ayu,' The matter of the fact was, I dont really care...I mean the C.C stuff and more...Im in cloud nine you see and the only thing I can think off when Im marking and stuff like that is to think about my dear Khai in Taiwan.Has he eaten,taken his bath or the most important thing does he look at the stars every night and think of me, like I think of him.ehehhe.    The irony part here, is that Ive known him...what like nearly two months perhaps and the impact he gave me.I have to admit, the first time I met him,it was a mutual thing, a fren thing, like I meet my other frens. Then goes on to the next meeting plus the hours we hang on the phone.hmm...kita boleh bergayut berjam-jam.  Seldom people can just have the same chemistry bonding with me and the one that I want to be with is not just any Tom, Dick or Harry, he must be confident but at the same time humble... Any Tom, Dick or Harry can be found anywhere,under the drain,clubhouses,brushing their ego or just looking at themselves in the mirror and telling it straight to their face that they are big time losers.   Being in a relationship is not just uttering a few words like  I love you  or  I want you  , being true to each other,and to truly feel at lost when the other party is not around. Nevertheless,his picture or his last words somehow cure the emptiness inside.  I don't understand on how sometimes relationship is build on  a stupid lie. To be truthful is a responsibility to the loved ones.When you commit to someone, you don't only give your words...its more than that.     Something to digest ....Les Brown - I believe there are three kinds of people. There are winners, who know what they want and understand their potential and the possibilities. They take life on. Next are losers, who don't have a clue as to who they are. They allow circumstances to shape their lives and their self-image. I believe there is a third group as well. This consists of potential winners whose lives are just slightly out of alignment. I call them wayward winners...",
            "Hmm...my heart's been in Stockbridge for about 10 years now.  When I first got here from Riverdale, I'll admit, I had a good cry. Missing my old family and friends really hit me hard.  But my parents, they wanted the best for me and my little sister. A better place to live, a better school...you know, like they always say, \"a step up from the ghetto.\"  I guess over time, I got used to it all. Made some new friends, some people who just rubbed me the wrong way. I never really got close to the neighbors though, except for Mr. Glen and his kids.  And Dennis for a little while. They're like family to me, I'm really grateful for them.\n\nRemember that time we went to Mr. Glen's wedding?  He and Ms. Veda tied the knot again. It was a blast!  I caught the little white strap she took off her leg, but I missed the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I had a real good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing great!\n\nThis neighborhood can be a bit of a puzzle, but with my GPS, I'm exploring more. Mostly, I hang out with my buddies Kason and Curtis.  We used to be glued to the video games, just living it up. Sometimes I'd head to the park, just to soak up some nature. It really calms me down.  Makes me feel at peace. I might bring some sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, maybe even my bokken if I can. It's just fun to do the things I love.  \n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court there too, even though I haven't touched a racket or a ball in ages.  Still nice to have around, you know, just in case I feel like playing again. My dad and Mr. Graves, they really got me and my best friend hooked on tennis back in the day. We had a blast! They pushed us hard, but it was always fun.\n\nThere are so many good times here, so many stories.  These are just the ones that really stick with me.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is just a hop, skip and a jump from my college, which is super convenient.  Most of the buildings are apartments, but there are a few restaurants and bars sprinkled around that are fun to hang out at without breaking the bank. One bar just got a fancy new name, but it's a bit pricier now.  The drinks aren't bad, but the service is kind of meh.  Mostly, you'll find college kids and folks who are on a tight budget living here,  since the apartments aren't too expensive. There are a ton of kids around too because there's an elementary school just a stone's throw away.  I don't really know my neighbors, and honestly, I'm kinda okay with that. They have a bit of a penchant for marijuana, so the building management put one of those air freshener things right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I thought was hilarious - kinda rude, but funny.  \n\nThe buildings around here are a bit old-fashioned, though some have been spruced up inside.  Down the street, there are these brand new apartment buildings, but I'm not a fan.  They feel kinda cheap and flimsy, but the rent is super high - a total rip-off, in my opinion.  I guess they can get away with it because they're close to campus. \n\nThere's this super cheap eats place just five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates. Everything is microwaved, but hey, it gets the job done.  Across the street is a gas station that doesn't have a great reputation.  But last summer, they redid the road with city money, so now there's a nice wide sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area is looking a bit nicer.  My apartment building is tucked away behind some trees, though they did chop down a few. I guess they're trying to open things up. \n\nBehind my complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind is 43rd Street, and it's not as charming.  The sidewalks are crumbling, and most of the buildings look pretty rough around the edges. There are a lot of trees there too, probably to hide the not-so-pretty buildings. There's been a lot of crime in that area, mostly at one particular apartment complex, though it's not fair to blame them alone.  The apartments across the street from me are also a bit sketchy with a lot of turnover. \n\nOverall, though, I kinda like where I live. It's affordable, and I have everything I need nearby.  The best part is that my college is just a walk away, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood feels like a little slice of old-fashioned charm. It's made up of these cute duplexes, all tucked away on a quiet cul-de-sac. They're spaced out just enough so they look like individual houses, and they all have this sweet, matching look with their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs.  Most of the folks here are friends, and we often gather at the end of the driveways in the evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's so nice to have that sense of community, especially in this crazy, tech-driven world. It feels like stepping back in time.\n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees, with big blue skies and fluffy white clouds. It's picture-perfect, really.  The only downside lately has been the tornado warnings. Last night, we actually heard the sirens! So, there I was, tucked away in my bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows, just in case. My big dog wasn't as keen on the bathroom idea and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The whole neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail pounding on everything. It was pretty intense.  \n\nAfter the storm, the road seemed to be steaming from the temperature change. It went from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes! The hail melted instantly as it hit the hot pavement. As the clouds cleared, the sun came out and started pouring rain. And then, the most amazing thing happened: a double rainbow! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were just as awestruck as I was.\n\nThings calmed down after an hour or so, and people started trickling back home. It was back to normal pretty quickly - moms and kids out playing, dinner cooking.  It's a really friendly neighborhood, and I love it here.  \n\nI live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else.  They all look the same on the outside, but the insides are different. Some are surprisingly small, which I don't quite understand.  I love taking walks in the big field behind my place and heading down to the pond. It's not for swimming, but it's a great spot to see deer. In the morning, you can hear this giant bullfrog singing his heart out. It's a fantastic place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte.  \n\nEvery morning, we're greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like living in a little village. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that bray's in the evenings, letting us know he's around. I feel so lucky to have found this special place.",
            "Hmm...moving to this new place was right around the time I started eighth grade.  Making friends was tough at first, you know? But then I met this awesome guy who lives just two houses down, and another cool dude on my street.  They've moved on since then, but the memories are still there, like little treasures tucked away. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still around, just like those familiar faces in a favorite song.  It's a pretty typical neighborhood, like so many others you see in those movies, full of two-story houses and the sound of kids laughing and playing outside whenever the weather's nice. It's pretty quiet most days, which is kind of nice.\n\nI've never had any trouble with anyone here. People keep to themselves, which is cool.  You're left alone unless you need something, like if you need help moving a heavy box or something.  I've ordered a bunch of stuff online, and not once has anything gone missing from my porch.  It makes me feel safe, knowing I can trust the people around me.\n\nThere's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my house. We've got so many memories there, me and the guys.  We used to play basketball, football, even baseball.  I even got whacked in the nose playing football, which wasn't so fun, but hey, those good times definitely outweigh the bad ones. Now, when I go there, it's mostly to hang out with my cousins' kids. They're little, still into swings and slides and all that. Just thinking about going to the park makes their eyes light up, which is so sweet.  It brings back a whole lot of memories, you know?\n\nThe neighborhood's pretty diverse, which is awesome. You can find all kinds of food around here.  Within just a mile, you've got Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – everything! But these days, everyone seems to be ordering in with those apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.  The usual fast food places are everywhere, and there's always a pizza place on every corner.  \n\nThere are tons of stores, too, with everything you could possibly need.  Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, even a Jewel-Osco grocery store – it's like a mini-city! There's even an Indian store if you're in the mood for some homemade curry or ready-made samosas.\n\nLooking at what other people go through in their neighborhoods, it makes me really appreciate this place. It's a haven, a little slice of peace. I'm grateful to call it home.",
            "My town, Johnston, is a little slice of Southern charm, nestled in the heart of South Carolina. It might not be the flashiest place around, but it's got a special place in my heart, especially when it comes to peaches. You see, Johnston proudly wears the crown of \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title you'll see proudly displayed on the welcome sign.  \n\nEverywhere you look, it's a sea of green, dotted with peach trees and cattle pastures. The houses are mostly spread out, with two-story beauties sporting either metal roofs to beat the summer heat or classic gray shingles. They often sit back from the road, leaving plenty of space for fields and farm animals.\n\nThe heart of town is centered around a single, lonely stoplight at a four-way intersection. It's here you'll find the town's only stores, a testament to its small-town vibe. For a quick bite, you can choose from Hong Kong, a cozy Chinese joint run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a familiar burger chain. We used to have a pizza place, but it sadly closed up shop a while back. \n\nThere's a tiny, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for their delicious Cherry Coca-Cola. Then there's the Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), a bit pricey but the only grocery store for miles around. Most folks prefer to make the trip to Batesburg-Leesville for their weekly shopping spree at Walmart, though. \n\nThe real star of the show is hands down Dollar General. You can find everything you need there, and it's always bustling from opening to closing. There's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a sweet little shop run by a beloved local lady. They've been around forever and even offer delivery with their own movers! Tucked behind the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a full-service pet groomer with daycare and boarding options. \n\nBoth the doctor's office and the veterinary clinic are a bit off the beaten path, but they're well-equipped to take care of the townspeople. \n\nOur only elementary school is Johnston Elementary, but once kids finish fifth grade, they have to head to the next town over for middle and high school.  \n\nParks? Not so much. We're working on a 2.5-acre recreation area to give families a place to hang out and maybe lure in some new residents. But honestly, Johnston isn't exactly a bustling metropolis. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or trendy spots to hang. It's so small, you could practically drive through it without even noticing!  \n\nBut that's the charm of Johnston. It's a quiet, friendly place where everyone knows everyone, and life moves at a slower pace. It may not be flashy, but it's home.",
            "My ears first heard whispers of this place while listening to a podcast about vanished souls. It was a bit of a shocker, really. Every apartment around here goes for over a thousand dollars a month, you know? I'd never heard a peep about any missing persons, and neither had any of my buddies. Maybe it's the struggle, the daily grind. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, worried about making ends meet. Things are pricey, but we've learned to be clever with our money over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty charm of second-hand toys and clothes that have seen better days. You lose that new car smell pretty fast in adulthood. Maybe you pick up a habit like smoking, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But the flea market, oh, that place always calls back to you. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, clinging to the leather even after a good wash.   \n\nThere are three thrift stores within walking distance here. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and a quirky little curio shop. Downtown is bustling, cars and people pouring into the streets every morning, but those thrift stores? They're peaceful sanctuaries. No matter how many people or cars go by, the inside is quiet. It's a perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon. Every year, more and more people and cars seem to flood in. They say it's a developing city, growing pains and all. It reminds me a bit of New York, actually. Everyone here is focused on their own goals, and no one really expects much from you. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like back home, where showing a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into your life, not really. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city just keeps rolling on like waves on the beach. \n\nIt's a vibrant place to be, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we're less like strangers in an apartment building and more like a community of friends. We come together when we need to, for birthdays, funerals, to help each other out. I feel lucky to be here, truthfully. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them a little treat now and then, and they do the same for me. We bring each other mail, lend a hand when needed. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. \n\nI live in this massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "My neighbourhood, well, it's like a picture postcard of suburbia, you know?  Everything's so... neat.  The homeowner's association, they're like the invisible hand making sure everything's just so. Every house looks pretty much the same - a little patch of grass, some fancy rocks, a short driveway, maybe a little tree here and there.  And, of course, every house has a two-car garage. The roads are spotless, not a pothole in sight, all freshly paved.  Most are single-story, but you'll find some two-story ones sprinkled in.  \n\nNow, about the mailboxes -  they're not your typical kind. No individual boxes out front, no sir. It's more like an apartment building, a whole cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street. And there are these big lockers for packages too. Gotta love that HOA love for uniformity. \n\nSince my house sits on the edge of the city, our neighborhood's kind of a mix of country and suburb. We've got tons of space! There are community pools, all fancy and gated, and walking trails where you can take your dog or just go for a peaceful stroll. No need to go to a park for some exercise, you can just run around the neighborhood and get a good workout. \n\nMost folks here are retired, it's a really safe place, everyone looks out for each other. But there are some middle-aged and young professionals sprinkled in too. \n\nThe city itself is a bit of a paradox -  huge by population, but still feels small town cozy.  We've got most of the things you need, like that one mall - not huge, but it does the trick.  It's about a 15-minute drive to get anywhere interesting, but once you get there, there are tons of stores to choose from - fancy organic grocery stores, bargain outlets with just a handful of things and barely any staff... you name it. \n\nSo yeah, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, pretty typical, really.  We've got our community things like pools and trails, and while we're not right next to shopping, it's just a quick drive to anything you could want.",
            "My little corner of the world is a small town, just outside the big city buzz. It feels kinda like everyone knows each other here.  My street, on the east side, it's where the folks who don't have much money live. The houses are older, and most folks are renting. But you know what? It's not bad.  My neighbors, they're like family. Always a friendly wave and a hello when we pass each other.  Things happen, sometimes things get rough, but it's not like it's a scary place. There's been some drama, a few bad things, like shootings and stuff.  Our neighbors next door, they lost their boy last year.  It was heartbreaking.  Luckily, nothing too bad has ever happened to us directly.  Maybe something goes missing from the porch now and then, but that's about it.\n\nThis whole town, it's been hit hard by those \"opioid\" problems you hear about.  It's sad, folks losing their lives to that stuff. But there are good people here. They're trying to help. There are places where folks can get help with addiction, and folks are learning how to use that Narcan thing to save lives.  It's a tough situation, but people are trying.\n\nThere are a lot of good things here too. My son, he goes to a great school. The teachers and everyone there, they're amazing.  He's got special needs, but no one has ever bothered him. The school is so positive, he loves it there. We've got a strong parent group that always has fun events going on.  \n\nBecause so many families here struggle, the school makes sure every kid gets breakfast and lunch for free. No one ever has to worry about going hungry.  They don't judge anyone for not having a lot of money.  School stuff is also really affordable.  \n\nThe city folks have been working hard to make things look nicer.  They've fixed up the roads, planted flowers, and spruced up the parks.  But mostly, they've been focusing on the center of town, where the stores and restaurants are.  My side of town, it seems like it gets left behind sometimes.  That's a bummer, but I still like it here.  \n\nWe've been here for over 16 years. Our house isn't fancy, but it's home.  The people are kind, the schools are great, we've got everything we need, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a place with a story, ya know? Perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of times gone by. I live in a seven-story apartment building, right across from an old theater, its curtain still waiting for its next act. Just down the street, a cool little arcade bar draws in all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Come June and July, especially on weekends, you'll see a line stretching out the door, just buzzing with anticipation. A few blocks up, there's a city park, a green haven in the heart of it all. It's a decent size for this part of town, surrounded by concrete and these tall, sturdy stairs built right into the wall. In the winter, when the cold bites deep and the rain comes pouring down, you see them - folks without homes, setting up their tents in neat little rows along the sidewalk and those wide steps. They huddle close, seeking warmth in numbers,  closer to the city center than the wilderness. It's not far to the family center, either, where they can find a hot shower and a moment of peace.  But what I love most about this place, it's not the history etched into the buildings, the proud structures reaching for the sky or the way the architecture spills down the hills towards the ocean. No, it's the people. You see, Hilltop, once known as the most dangerous place on the West Coast, still carries the weight of its past. Stories linger, whispers passed down through generations, even three decades later, of the feds and the DEA sweeping through, trying to cleanse the streets. The people remember. \n\nThey work hard, even though folks still whisper about the rough edges of Hilltop. They care about their corner of the world, about keeping it clean, about keeping it theirs. Some folks say, \"Don't walk around Hilltop after dark if you're white,\" but I think that's just a shadow of the old days, a lingering echo of fear and prejudice. Maybe it's because I walk with a shade that blends in, or maybe Hilltop sees a kindred spirit in me, someone who knows the sting of prejudice, the weight of assumptions.  I know one thing: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. The streets pulse with a life that makes me feel alive. I've walked those streets in the dark, met people who'd offer me a jacket before they'd think to rob me. The laundromat owner left her store open late so I could charge my phone when the rain trapped me outside.  On the coldest nights, huddled in the shadow of a shop front, I felt invisible until someone stopped, looked me in the eye, and handed me five dollars, whispering, \"You're beautiful, you're valuable.\"  Hilltop is a place where kindness is a language everyone understands.",
            "My life unfolds in the heart of rural America, nestled amidst  the rolling farmland and charming tourist towns of small-town Michigan. It's a place where you won't find the bustling energy of big city malls, the familiar giants like Walmart or Target, or even a casual dining spot like Applebee's. Everything requires a little drive, a journey that takes you through the picturesque landscape.  But despite the lack of urban conveniences, I live in a slice of paradise, surrounded by the shimmering allure of water. My little town is cradled between the majestic Lake Michigan and the serene beauty of Lake Charlevoix. Every direction you turn, you'll find a beach beckoning you to dip your toes into its cool embrace.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the true spirit of small-town living. Houses stand proudly, each with its own unique story, some boasting updated interiors while others retain their vintage charm. Basements, the kind you can peek into from the street, are a common sight, and the houses wear their colorful aluminum siding like badges of honor.  Here, you'll find a kaleidoscope of colors adorning the blocks, a testament to the individuality of its residents. Most homes have yards, spaces where children's laughter echoes as they bounce on trampolines or swing on playsets. Gardens bloom with vibrant flowers, and fences enclose furry companions, creating a tapestry of life and family. \n\nIt's a neighborhood that reflects the heart of Middle America, a place where hard-working folks strive to build a life for themselves and their families. The streets are alive with the joyful sounds of children playing, dogs barking, and the rhythmic whir of bikes and rollerblades. The sense of community is tangible; neighbors greet each other with waves and smiles, forming a network of support and familiarity.  \n\nThe lawns are meticulously maintained, free from the clutter of fallen leaves and boasting emerald green grass.  Gardens are meticulously pruned, and bushes are trimmed to perfection, creating an atmosphere of order and care. This isn't a neighborhood that boasts ostentatious mansions, but a place that whispers, \"welcome home.\" It's a haven where families feel safe and secure, a place to put down roots and watch your children grow.\n\nJust a stone's throw away, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, a symbol of security and order.  The Health department is a close neighbor, ensuring the well-being of the community.  The recycling center stands ready to serve the needs of residents. \n\nThe sound of baseball games fills the air as children and adults alike enjoy the thrill of the game. Nearby, the small town airport hums with activity, the rumble of planes taking off and landing a constant reminder of the world beyond.  A local ice cream parlor beckons with its sweet aroma, and a short stroll takes you to the heart of downtown.  My children can ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away, where they can spend hours of carefree joy."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My city is a real melting pot, you know? It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle with all these different pieces fitting together in a crazy way.  Living here is like being on a never-ending adventure. You've got your residential pockets scattered all over the place, tucked in between shops and restaurants and offices.  It's like a feast for the senses, with new places popping up all the time. \n\nWe've got those big, fancy stores that everyone knows, but then there are these hidden gems, these little boutiques that just make you want to pop in. They're everywhere, even on quiet streets you wouldn't expect, adding a touch of magic to the everyday.  And don't even get me started on the parks! They're always filled with families, kids running around, having fun. It's heartwarming to see. \n\nSpeaking of diverse, this place is bursting with different cultures.  Right here in my neighborhood, you've got your LGBTQ+ folks, a tight-knit Orthodox Jewish community, and even folks who have made their way here from the old Soviet Union. It's like a little world within a world.  \n\nAnd if you venture a little further out, you'll find even more communities, like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia... they're all just a stone's throw away, but sometimes getting there feels like a journey. Traffic can be a nightmare, especially during rush hour.  You can drive for miles and miles, but it might only take you a few blocks.\n\nIt's funny, though, because even with all this traffic, everyone seems to be adding more buildings to the city.  New apartment blocks are springing up everywhere, but some people are starting to worry that it's getting too crowded.\n\nBut hey, there's something for everyone here. You've got your big apartment buildings, your cozy houses, even duplexes.  It's all mixed up, just like the people who live here.\n\nI've lived here my whole life, but I still feel like I'm constantly meeting new people.  It's not exactly a tight-knit community anymore, but that's okay. It's still exciting, always something new to discover. Maybe that's the beauty of city life, always keeping you on your toes.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a quirky little slice of America, ya know? Most of the houses are like those classic single-family ones, but some folks split 'em up, making two homes out of one, still attached like twins. My place has got a little patch of grass out front and a teeny driveway, just enough for one car. It's like a picture postcard from a bygone era, back when the American dream meant living in the suburbs.  Back then, it felt like everyone was chasing that dream, but now, it's like the dream's drifting away, getting harder to hold onto. \n\nBut my neighborhood, it's still holding strong, whispering that the dream's still out there, just gotta keep reachin' for it. Folks ain't as hopeful as they used to be, the lawns ain't as manicured, but you still see a couple cars in most driveways, and the kids, they're running wild, like the world's their playground. There's this old school, been around for nigh on 90 years, still standing tall, givin' kids a glimpse of the future, while the old folks reminisce about their own school days. Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts? Packed! All the houses look different, but they all feel the same, like they're part of the same story.\n\nWe got this big supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by this big, friendly Yemeni family, they're probably the only Arab folks around here.

Too old-fashioned for the young folks, but the older folks love it, a night out without all the hustle and bustle.\n\nWe got this expressway runnin' through town, but the on and off ramps are just outside our borders. Tried to get an exit, young folks wanted it, but the old-timers said it'd ruin our town. They got their way, kept things just the way they were. Now they're buildin' a new high school, and we're tryin' to pick a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a Southern drawl and a log cabin would sum up our town pretty good.",

You'll see some complexes that've been in the news for some not-so-nice stuff, so let's not dwell on those, yeah? Appearances can be deceiving. But the ones next to those, the ones beside those, those are a whole other story, a world most folks around here never even know about.\n\nJust across from those complexes, you've got this community college, a little branch campus. Quiet as a mouse, it is, with students shuffling in, coffee in hand, yawning like it's the end of the world at seven in the morning. The iron gates creak open for them one by one, while folks rushing to work shake their fists and grumble about them slowing things down on busy days.

            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the endless cornfields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she wouldn't believe how simple and open everything was. She was used to living in a town where everything was just a short walk away, she'd never seen this much space in her life. Overwhelmed by all the corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we continued down this two-lane country road, we came to a quarry filled with water.

My sister and I used to fight a lot when we were kids, and in the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice.

            "Hmm...let me tell you about Portland, Oregon, this place with a unique kind of \"weirdness\". You'll see it everywhere, even on the side of a building that's part pizza joint, part bar, part music venue, part strip club...you get the picture.  They say \"Keep Portland Weird\" there, like it's a promise.  Some folks, they remember the old Portland, back when it was still hidden away and affordable. That's the Portland that birthed all the creative, quirky subcultures. Others, well, they see it as an invitation - come to Portland, where being different is a good thing, something to celebrate.  Even with all those fancy Californians moving in and those shiny new condos popping up everywhere, Portland still holds onto that weirdness.\n\nBut what exactly does \"weird\" mean here? It's not about being totally accepting of everything, no. It's about accepting the things that might make others raise an eyebrow. It's about knowing that we still have all the modern conveniences and the same everyday struggles as anywhere else. Sure, we buy most of our stuff from China, just like everyone else. There are a million ways to be different, to not fit in, and Portland has plenty of those. \n\nYou'll find yoga studios, hipsters, and suits working in offices here, just like anywhere else. Maybe \"weird\" just means we take it all a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, and in lots of others, you'll see houses painted in all sorts of bright colors, gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and even free boxes lining the sidewalks. These boxes, well, they're a Portland tradition. They're filled with treasures - clothes, books, sometimes even something completely unexpected. It's like a little surprise waiting for you around every corner.  \n\nThat magical feeling of discovering something special in the most ordinary places, that's what Portland is all about to me. At least, that's my version of weird. I know there are thousands of other kinds of weird here. Some folks wouldn't dream of taking anything out of a box on the street. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yes, you read that right!) or cheer on the Timbers soccer team. Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things, dream big, or at least dream about dreaming big while sipping a pint at the local pub. \n\nWe're not perfect, though. Like anywhere else, we have our struggles. Portland has a drug problem, and it's hard not to see the connection between that and the mental health issues that often go hand in hand. The constant rain and gray skies probably don't help either. And then there's the issue of homelessness, a problem that seems to plague every city. Portland tries to help, but our programs aren't enough.  Some people here are compassionate, while others just give up hope. Honestly, that's not so weird, is it? It's just part of being human.",
            "The mountains, they've always been there, like silent guardians watching over everything. Northward, they stand tall, witnessing every sunrise and sunset, unmoved by the hustle and bustle of life. Even when I'm caught up in my studies or work, they're still there, solid and unwavering. On days when stress weighs heavy on me, they seem to call out, demanding to be seen. And when I turn to them, they offer a calming presence, a source of strength to carry on, one day at a time.\n\nIt all started when I first moved here for university. The mountains north of campus captured my heart immediately. The university itself has its own beauty – the buildings, the ponds, the trees – each holding a special place in my memory. But the mountains, they rule them all.  \n\nThe town itself is a charming mix of the familiar and the unexpected. There are countless cafes where I spent countless hours fueled by coffee and late-night study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where faded brick buildings whisper stories of a bygone era. It's here that the town pulses with a vibrant energy, almost as if it's trying to outshine its bustling city neighbor. But just a few blocks away, you can escape back to the peaceful charm of small-town life, passing by the library on your way. This beautiful contrast, this close proximity of two distinct atmospheres, gives the town a magical quality, inviting you to explore its every nook and cranny.\n\nIt's a town where memories are made, both cherished and bittersweet. There's the rusty swing set in the park, where friends and I would congregate after all-nighters, or the frantic dash through the downtown area to catch a movie at the fancy theater thanks to a student discount. But like all places, it holds its share of painful memories too. The ponds, especially, seem to be a magnet for introspection and tearful confessions at 2 a.m. during existential crises – an experience I've had more times than I care to admit.\n\nWhile watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each with their own purpose, I couldn't help but question my own path. I walked past the pond, the park, the houses that screamed suburbia, until I found myself on a main street. As I walked, the sun bathed the palm trees in its golden light, painting the sky with vibrant hues. Looking up, I realized I was heading north. And there they were, as steadfast as ever. The mountains, majestically towering above everything else, their presence a silent reminder of my own strength and perseverance.",
            "My, oh my, if you ever find yourself planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it!  Getting around is a breeze, especially with the awesome public transportation, you know, one of the big things in New York City.  Bensonhurst has a real city vibe, so you'll be smack-dab in the heart of it all.  \n\nAnd speaking of vibes, get ready for a real sensory experience! You'll see these amazing Asian stores everywhere you look. In the last twenty years or so, Bensonhurst has become a real melting pot, especially with all the Asian folks moving in.  It's like every block has an Asian-owned store, you'll be spoiled for choice! Supermarkets and laundromats seem to be the most popular, and they're a hit with everyone, not just the Asian community. The food in the supermarkets is top-notch, the prices are super reasonable, and let's be honest, it's just so darn convenient. I mean, I live right near a cluster of four Asian supermarkets, all within a couple of minutes walking distance! Talk about convenience!\n\nBut don't think Bensonhurst is all about one culture, oh no! It's a real mix of people, with immigrants, and their kids who are first and second generation Americans, all living together.  While most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, there's a cool new park nearby that's got something for everyone. Ten basketball courts, a huge field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for the little ones, even a water fountain to cool off in the summer. It's a true melting pot, with people from all walks of life hanging out and getting along.\n\nAs for buildings, you won't find too many big, corporate towers here. Mostly, it's co-op buildings and condos. The majority of peeps live in these cute two-family houses, though.  The people here are generally nice, but can be a bit noisy, if you catch my drift.  Cars blasting music as they drive by,  people revving their engines in the morning...it can wake you right up! If you're planning to be out at night, keep your wits about you.  Bensonhurst is pretty safe, but you never know when you might run into some troublemakers, bullies, or even thieves. I've been through some things here myself, a few run-ins in the past, nothing too bad, but it's good to be aware. \n\nAnother thing, there's been a bit of a package theft problem lately.  Not a good look, right?  And while New York City has rules about cleaning up after your dog, some folks don't seem to get the memo.  Every morning, you'll probably see at least one piece of dog waste on your way to the train or the supermarket.  It's a real pet peeve of mine, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood is a peculiar place, perched precariously on the highest hill in town. People call it the \"workout hill\" because all the runners love to challenge themselves with its steep incline. The lack of sidewalks forces everyone to walk on the road, which is cracked and uneven in spots, making it a bit of a bumpy ride. The power lines strung across the street tell a story of their own, tattered and patched together after countless encounters with falling branches and storms.  \n\nEverywhere you look, towering evergreen trees stand sentinel.  But here's the funny thing - folks around here despise them! They're always trying to chop them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are built high up on the hill, with giant second stories boasting glass walls, desperately trying to catch a glimpse of the bay.\n\nSunsets are breathtaking, though. The water shimmers like liquid gold, and the sky explodes in a blaze of orange. Most days, though, the clouds steal the show, shrouding everything in a soft, damp haze. Moss thrives in this dampness, clinging to roofs, cars, even railings. Once, I left my car parked for a month, and it emerged looking like a furry green monster - three hours of scrubbing later, it was finally clean.\n\nKids are a rare sight in our neighborhood.  There's a school just a few blocks away, but it's mostly populated by retired folks.  Dogs, on the other hand, are everywhere. You'll find them lounging on lawns, chasing each other down the street, or sometimes, even sneaking into your house if you leave a door open!  I once found one in my living room, patiently waiting for a treat.\n\nRabbits also roam freely, much to the annoyance of gardeners who find their burrows digging up precious plants. But my cats are thrilled, having hunted most of them out of our yard.  We also have our fair share of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle, who often get chased away by the resident crows.\n\nThere aren't any stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood.  The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can easily see the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "Hmm... life here is kinda like one of those slow-moving movies, you know?  I live on this little street in a sleepy town down south, kinda tucked between two busy highways.  So, we get our fair share of traffic, nothin' too wild though. It's a pretty quiet neighborhood, most folks here have lived here for ages, so we all know each other pretty well.  It's the kind of place where everyone's busy with their own thing - tending to their yards, running errands, that kinda stuff.   \n\nWe live on the corner, so we get a front-row seat to all the neighborhood action. We know all the cars that go by, and if somethin' new rolls up, well, we take notice.  Some folks like to take walks, others walk their dogs, and the kids, they're always whizzing around on their bikes.  \n\nMy wife and I work from home, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen, are always underfoot. We're pretty much homebodies, so everyone's used to seeing us come and go. We love to play outside, even when it's drizzling, and we'll fire up the grill on our back deck whenever we get the chance.  It's like an unspoken rule - you gotta smell that barbecue at least once a week! \n\nThere's nothin' but trees around here, it used to be all woods, so we've got plenty of shade, but that means a whole lot of leaves come Fall. Raking and burning leaves is practically a family tradition. That smoky smell just screams \"Autumn\" to me, you know?\n\nThis year, we haven't had much of a winter at all, just a long, drawn-out Fall.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we only use the front door for company, which isn't often.\n\nI like to tinker in the garage with my truck or other projects, and when the doors are open, I feel like I'm more connected to the whole neighborhood. Holidays are a little more lively - Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas - folks come visit and the street gets crowded with cars.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty good life here.  If it weren't for that through-street traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where it's dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably don't get it. Like, you just don't understand the feeling of seeing brown everywhere you look. And when you do see a lawn, you know that person is dropping serious cash on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first lived here, the houses were spread out like they were trying to escape each other. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a bunch of new places popping up. Honestly, it's starting to feel more like a city every day, but I guess that's happening everywhere, right?\n\nMost of the people here are really friendly, just like in any place, you have your ups and downs. But in my part of town, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so it's a pretty nice place to be.\n\nThe stores around here are mostly the chain kind, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for something upscale, you gotta drive a bit. Never see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here. \n\nBased on what I see, the biggest industry in town is construction. I think that's because the city is still growing. There are still tons of wide-open spaces waiting to be built on.  It kinda freaks me out, actually. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city, and I'm not looking to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living – drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nOne of the things I love about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert itself is definitely a big draw. The high desert climate and landscape have created some pretty amazing ecosystems that need protecting. We share this space with all sorts of awesome creatures, and it's important that we learn about them so we can live together peacefully.\n\nMy family and I have gotten pretty good at coexisting with the wildlife. I have three kids, and they're obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. They're out there right now, trying to catch all sorts of interesting critters.\n\nAs for things to do around here, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert in a different way.  If you're visiting, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a ton of fun, and it really captures the Victorville spirit.  \n\nYou can also head up to nearby Wrightwood to see the snowy mountains and even take a winter sports lesson. \n\nIf you're interested in learning about the history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit. They have all sorts of cool stuff – geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how Victorville came to be.",
            "Hmm...my heart n soui went to Taiwan last Thursday,on the 1st to be precise. Im going to miss him and it has only been a day and yet here I am looking at his photo... again and again as if the world is going to come tumbling down.  Yup...his job is kinda time constraining,him an officer in the army ... I have to live with that for the rest of my life. Yet, I am happy with him. There's chemistry and we could talk about anything from weapons,politics or even the simple terminology of self reflection. I feel safe with him...maybe he is my knight n shinning armour who  has come to save me amidst the confusion. He was so sweet,the day he called me before he flew off, he said ' In any decision that you are going to make, I will say yes to it all,I wiil support you and at the end of the day, I will always be there for you,' I almost cried when he said that, Ive been waiting for someone to tell me that.  Dear Khai,my knight and shinning armour, come back to me when your job is done...   Untukmu Khai  Untukmu Ku saluti benang-benang sutera, menjadi perhiasan setiap pereka, menjadi keinginan si dara jelita, menjadi rebutan si putera raja... Setiap lirikan mata, Setiap gerak geri bicara, Ku perkemaskan tenunan, Ku halusi perasaan, Lalu,dengan perlahan redup matamu ku perhatikan, Lalu aku relakan... mereka istana pasir, dari embun-embun kasih.  - 3.4.2004                  tired...the whole day in school was spend in meetings. A friend of mine sms me saying that he had just came back from a short getaway. At first I was so relieved that he message me...then again. Believing in your feelings can really be difficult...especially when the other party does not feel the same way.To cross a friends path thats another issue...hmm,did some surfing on the net,discovered some beautiful poems.  This poem captured my heart,it goes on like this,  A Dream within a Dream by Edgar Allen Poe   Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem That my days have been a dream; Yet, if Hope has flown away In a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it, therefore, the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.  I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?  Been thinking of a certain someone that I really like...once upon a time. When everything was so  colourful, the air was sweet, the trees were beautiful...hmm.Thinking that it was meant to last forever n ever. Indeed, it only existed in fairy tales.True enough.                 Yesterday, the 4 of us went to Bukit Batok, me, my sis, ayu n hanip. We went to meet Keris, they were feeling kinda of down. Pity them. After that, we went and have a drink at Mas Ayu wif the other Kelana guys. Hmm...ayu cracking jokes about Talib, all the way from Bukit Batok to Mas Ayu. We were out control...giggling and laughing our hearts out throughout the journey. Irony.  I woke up late this morning. Marking my karangan...the neverending ordeal. After this, Im suppose to meet my P6EM3. I just realise how happy I am. although Im shoudering a lot of responsibilities.   The other day, my sis saw Khai, presuming with his wife. Hmm...life, what can I say. Yet, the bigger picture is, trust, guys and marriage. Marriage is a huge responsibility... a commitment. Nevertheless, when to think of it back, everything make sense. Maybe, it was a good thing in getting to know him, yup...he hurt me, but if we were to look at it at another perspective, he had hurt his partner even more, the trust. Me, being the third party. Retribution, I do not want to see it coming. I love my dear Hanip so much. Even to think of it, will make me sick. Then again, if it is meant to be...then be it. In life we have to be strong in tackling problem. It can be him and it can be me. He told me,  feelings can change, which is terribly true.     2.55 pm   Just finish cutting the tickets, the alignment has gone haywired. Ismail has been bugging me on the tickets. Hmm...Im searching for the C.C chop, I misplaced it , somehow. Im tired. My eyes are tired. Im tired. Ismail asked me whether they can use the mirror room. I try to see what I can do.    5.55 pm  Hmm...at de spur of moments, things can change. Now, Im feeling restless. Sad.   ' Which is one is better, 3 years or one n a half year...'  I think it is better if it is 3 years, then I won't be leaving in denial.  An everlasting commitment... ' the person can be me or you...' it can be Me or you...  &nbsp;     Kris Dayanti & Ajai          After reading my previous post, it lead me to think, saya ni orangnya berjiwang-jiwang. Hmm...enough of that sweetness in the air, the cloud nine, the everlasting cotton wool and being dragged back to the ground. Yesterday was the MAEC meeting, yup...we are going to have the gigantic group around...its not confimed yet but then again the glitters that we see in their eyes...can outshine the indoor stadium,hmm,im just exaggerating huh..     My sis and I decided to stay on because of these words...' We wont be in the CC, without you guys around,' hmm...so touched by what my dear bro Ayu had to say. And again we decided to stay on because of our dear ...Mr Zahidi Rahman, our supportive chairman. He actually begged us to stay. Thus,this year the first project is sponsored by the Heritage Centre with the help of us the MAEC.  Yup...the outlining of the budget, the Arts, and the most important thing the objective. For Mega Perdana...I don't really care. Mega Perdana had already been auction for the mere of $5,000. The so called Chairman is responsible for this.   Therefore, Singapore expect the next ala Gentarasa or even a bigger event to be truly organised by MAEC Siglap South and the Giants... Yesterday, Rizal called, he told me to write lyrics for the group. The theme, hmmm...something to do with Paruh... belum berilham hamba...  13 days to go, Khai. : )   'Love is not a matter of counting the years... it's making the years count.  --Wolfman Jack Smith                 yesterday was a very tiring and long day...woke up late to school. Hmm...had our Malam Anugerah Dikir 2004 penilaian...everyone was there.The emotional part was seeing them,the so called ' orang lama of the dikir barat world ' together after long years apart. Today,got an email... procedures on the registration to enrol on a degree programme in UM .still thinking,got the green light from my family.hmm...maybe I should enrol,there's nothing much left for me here,macam sedih gitukan... My friend told me, have you ever heard of the story about the Science teacher and her jar, the science teacher,put a few golf ball inside the jar,still its not full,the she put in some pebbles,followed by sand and the water. Then she said, in life we have to priorities,who are the golf balls,who symbolizes the sands and so on and so forth.The golf balls are people that are dear to you,people who meant a lot to you,the sand and the water symbolizes the so not important people,those that you can live without.Look here she said,you have to put the golf balls first,not the sand or the water.If you were to put the water first,you cannot put your golf balls...put the golfballs,then the pebbles,then the sand...then the water,you have to know. True...my families are my golf balls...the people that are dear to you.A friend told me that I kept making these stupid mistakes due to the fact that Im lonely, ehheheeh..more of a pathetic twisted personality. Now,Im a bit focus,confident tak tau asal...mungkin dah penat...mungkin. Adakah yang benar itu benar...tidak benar.                    Im hurting again...that's the irony part,I don't know why I am feeling this way. I can feel my heart bleeding thou...its happening again.Yup...as if a knife,slowly piercing deep through me. Yesterday, I went out with him and he brought up the issue of one of the gerl's group. I was so pissed off... yup... I totally lose control and the worse part, it was only like  30%  of my anger... bursting...it was not a full blast,then again.. it did make an impact.I kind of settled in when he crack some jokes about the boriah tingy...hmm,he is sweet...very sweet.  Guess what...7 new messages.Hmm...so many people I've blocked from my msn.Missed chatting with Shariffah aka yan, been busy lately...hmmm...  Again, let us analyse what the hell am I suffering from...is it an infectious or contagious disease...heheheeh, maybe I need to rest for another month or was it a pure act of jealousy..nah,that would be the last thing.... then again, maybe if you love the person too much, I would just like to imagine him being wrapped up neatly,in a package,put it in my closet,far away from all the girls as possible.At one point,I tend to become restless,twitchy and uneasy when he mentioned to me about his x.Im not a paranoid.To look at my past, I do have loads of Xs but then was then. Perhaps,Ive never been ditch before.The feeling must be overwhelming.Hmm...sad to say this,I think he still loves his x...that's it!! I couldn't sleep because I think he has feelings for his x. I feel terrible now...inferiority lurkes again. What a jughead, how can I not see this.. thats why I am feeling miserable..it has nothing to do with that masked man... Shucks...hmmm...jiwa retak pulak saya ni... Hai...how love can makes you a desperado and defy the norms.merepeknyelah saya...: ) Im listening to... Ada Apa Dengan Cinta...apa nak jadi hafidah,yeah...away feminisme and what is left of it...                     Guess what...a fren of mine by the name of Zai called, he hated when I call him that, the kelkatu man.heheeh,hmm...he sounded suprise. He asked me, ' Do you know that .....in your CC,' I said ' Yeah,Ive discussed it with Ayu,' The matter of the fact was, I dont really care...I mean the C.C stuff and more...Im in cloud nine you see and the only thing I can think off when Im marking and stuff like that is to think about my dear Khai in Taiwan.Has he eaten,taken his bath or the most important thing does he look at the stars every night and think of me, like I think of him.ehehhe.    The irony part here, is that Ive known him...what like nearly two months perhaps and the impact he gave me.I have to admit, the first time I met him,it was a mutual thing, a fren thing, like I meet my other frens. Then goes on to the next meeting plus the hours we hang on the phone.hmm...kita boleh bergayut berjam-jam.  Seldom people can just have the same chemistry bonding with me and the one that I want to be with is not just any Tom, Dick or Harry, he must be confident but at the same time humble... Any Tom, Dick or Harry can be found anywhere,under the drain,clubhouses,brushing their ego or just looking at themselves in the mirror and telling it straight to their face that they are big time losers.   Being in a relationship is not just uttering a few words like  I love you  or  I want you  , being true to each other,and to truly feel at lost when the other party is not around. Nevertheless,his picture or his last words somehow cure the emptiness inside.  I don't understand on how sometimes relationship is build on  a stupid lie. To be truthful is a responsibility to the loved ones.When you commit to someone, you don't only give your words...its more than that.     Something to digest ....Les Brown - I believe there are three kinds of people. There are winners, who know what they want and understand their potential and the possibilities. They take life on. Next are losers, who don't have a clue as to who they are. They allow circumstances to shape their lives and their self-image. I believe there is a third group as well. This consists of potential winners whose lives are just slightly out of alignment. I call them wayward winners...",
            "Hmm...my heart's been in Stockbridge for about 10 years now.  When I first got here from Riverdale, I'll admit, I had a good cry. Missing my old family and friends really hit me hard.  But my parents, they wanted the best for me and my little sister. A better place to live, a better school...you know, like they always say, \"a step up from the ghetto.\"  I guess over time, I got used to it all. Made some new friends, some people who just rubbed me the wrong way. I never really got close to the neighbors though, except for Mr. Glen and his kids.  And Dennis for a little while. They're like family to me, I'm really grateful for them.\n\nRemember that time we went to Mr. Glen's wedding?  He and Ms. Veda tied the knot again. It was a blast!  I caught the little white strap she took off her leg, but I missed the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I had a real good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing great!\n\nThis neighborhood can be a bit of a puzzle, but with my GPS, I'm exploring more. Mostly, I hang out with my buddies Kason and Curtis.  We used to be glued to the video games, just living it up. Sometimes I'd head to the park, just to soak up some nature. It really calms me down.  Makes me feel at peace. I might bring some sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, maybe even my bokken if I can. It's just fun to do the things I love.  \n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court there too, even though I haven't touched a racket or a ball in ages.  Still nice to have around, you know, just in case I feel like playing again. My dad and Mr. Graves, they really got me and my best friend hooked on tennis back in the day. We had a blast! They pushed us hard, but it was always fun.\n\nThere are so many good times here, so many stories.  These are just the ones that really stick with me.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is just a hop, skip and a jump from my college, which is super convenient.  Most of the buildings are apartments, but there are a few restaurants and bars sprinkled around that are fun to hang out at without breaking the bank. One bar just got a fancy new name, but it's a bit pricier now.  The drinks aren't bad, but the service is kind of meh.  Mostly, you'll find college kids and folks who are on a tight budget living here,  since the apartments aren't too expensive. There are a ton of kids around too because there's an elementary school just a stone's throw away.  I don't really know my neighbors, and honestly, I'm kinda okay with that. They have a bit of a penchant for marijuana, so the building management put one of those air freshener things right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I thought was hilarious - kinda rude, but funny.  \n\nThe buildings around here are a bit old-fashioned, though some have been spruced up inside.  Down the street, there are these brand new apartment buildings, but I'm not a fan.  They feel kinda cheap and flimsy, but the rent is super high - a total rip-off, in my opinion.  I guess they can get away with it because they're close to campus. \n\nThere's this super cheap eats place just five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates. Everything is microwaved, but hey, it gets the job done.  Across the street is a gas station that doesn't have a great reputation.  But last summer, they redid the road with city money, so now there's a nice wide sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area is looking a bit nicer.  My apartment building is tucked away behind some trees, though they did chop down a few. I guess they're trying to open things up. \n\nBehind my complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind is 43rd Street, and it's not as charming.  The sidewalks are crumbling, and most of the buildings look pretty rough around the edges. There are a lot of trees there too, probably to hide the not-so-pretty buildings. There's been a lot of crime in that area, mostly at one particular apartment complex, though it's not fair to blame them alone.  The apartments across the street from me are also a bit sketchy with a lot of turnover. \n\nOverall, though, I kinda like where I live. It's affordable, and I have everything I need nearby.  The best part is that my college is just a walk away, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood feels like a little slice of old-fashioned charm. It's made up of these cute duplexes, all tucked away on a quiet cul-de-sac. They're spaced out just enough so they look like individual houses, and they all have this sweet, matching look with their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs.  Most of the folks here are friends, and we often gather at the end of the driveways in the evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's so nice to have that sense of community, especially in this crazy, tech-driven world. It feels like stepping back in time.\n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees, with big blue skies and fluffy white clouds. It's picture-perfect, really.  The only downside lately has been the tornado warnings. Last night, we actually heard the sirens! So, there I was, tucked away in my bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows, just in case. My big dog wasn't as keen on the bathroom idea and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The whole neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail pounding on everything. It was pretty intense.  \n\nAfter the storm, the road seemed to be steaming from the temperature change. It went from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes! The hail melted instantly as it hit the hot pavement. As the clouds cleared, the sun came out and started pouring rain. And then, the most amazing thing happened: a double rainbow! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were just as awestruck as I was.\n\nThings calmed down after an hour or so, and people started trickling back home. It was back to normal pretty quickly - moms and kids out playing, dinner cooking.  It's a really friendly neighborhood, and I love it here.  \n\nI live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else.  They all look the same on the outside, but the insides are different. Some are surprisingly small, which I don't quite understand.  I love taking walks in the big field behind my place and heading down to the pond. It's not for swimming, but it's a great spot to see deer. In the morning, you can hear this giant bullfrog singing his heart out. It's a fantastic place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte.  \n\nEvery morning, we're greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like living in a little village. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that bray's in the evenings, letting us know he's around. I feel so lucky to have found this special place.",
            "Hmm...moving to this new place was right around the time I started eighth grade.  Making friends was tough at first, you know? But then I met this awesome guy who lives just two houses down, and another cool dude on my street.  They've moved on since then, but the memories are still there, like little treasures tucked away. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still around, just like those familiar faces in a favorite song.  It's a pretty typical neighborhood, like so many others you see in those movies, full of two-story houses and the sound of kids laughing and playing outside whenever the weather's nice. It's pretty quiet most days, which is kind of nice.\n\nI've never had any trouble with anyone here. People keep to themselves, which is cool.  You're left alone unless you need something, like if you need help moving a heavy box or something.  I've ordered a bunch of stuff online, and not once has anything gone missing from my porch.  It makes me feel safe, knowing I can trust the people around me.\n\nThere's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my house. We've got so many memories there, me and the guys.  We used to play basketball, football, even baseball.  I even got whacked in the nose playing football, which wasn't so fun, but hey, those good times definitely outweigh the bad ones. Now, when I go there, it's mostly to hang out with my cousins' kids. They're little, still into swings and slides and all that. Just thinking about going to the park makes their eyes light up, which is so sweet.  It brings back a whole lot of memories, you know?\n\nThe neighborhood's pretty diverse, which is awesome. You can find all kinds of food around here.  Within just a mile, you've got Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – everything! But these days, everyone seems to be ordering in with those apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.  The usual fast food places are everywhere, and there's always a pizza place on every corner.  \n\nThere are tons of stores, too, with everything you could possibly need.  Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, even a Jewel-Osco grocery store – it's like a mini-city! There's even an Indian store if you're in the mood for some homemade curry or ready-made samosas.\n\nLooking at what other people go through in their neighborhoods, it makes me really appreciate this place. It's a haven, a little slice of peace. I'm grateful to call it home.",
            "My town, Johnston, is a little slice of Southern charm, nestled in the heart of South Carolina. It might not be the flashiest place around, but it's got a special place in my heart, especially when it comes to peaches. You see, Johnston proudly wears the crown of \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title you'll see proudly displayed on the welcome sign.  \n\nEverywhere you look, it's a sea of green, dotted with peach trees and cattle pastures. The houses are mostly spread out, with two-story beauties sporting either metal roofs to beat the summer heat or classic gray shingles. They often sit back from the road, leaving plenty of space for fields and farm animals.\n\nThe heart of town is centered around a single, lonely stoplight at a four-way intersection. It's here you'll find the town's only stores, a testament to its small-town vibe. For a quick bite, you can choose from Hong Kong, a cozy Chinese joint run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a familiar burger chain. We used to have a pizza place, but it sadly closed up shop a while back. \n\nThere's a tiny, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for their delicious Cherry Coca-Cola. Then there's the Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), a bit pricey but the only grocery store for miles around. Most folks prefer to make the trip to Batesburg-Leesville for their weekly shopping spree at Walmart, though. \n\nThe real star of the show is hands down Dollar General. You can find everything you need there, and it's always bustling from opening to closing. There's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a sweet little shop run by a beloved local lady. They've been around forever and even offer delivery with their own movers! Tucked behind the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a full-service pet groomer with daycare and boarding options. \n\nBoth the doctor's office and the veterinary clinic are a bit off the beaten path, but they're well-equipped to take care of the townspeople. \n\nOur only elementary school is Johnston Elementary, but once kids finish fifth grade, they have to head to the next town over for middle and high school.  \n\nParks? Not so much. We're working on a 2.5-acre recreation area to give families a place to hang out and maybe lure in some new residents. But honestly, Johnston isn't exactly a bustling metropolis. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or trendy spots to hang. It's so small, you could practically drive through it without even noticing!  \n\nBut that's the charm of Johnston. It's a quiet, friendly place where everyone knows everyone, and life moves at a slower pace. It may not be flashy, but it's home.",
            "My ears first heard whispers of this place while listening to a podcast about vanished souls. It was a bit of a shocker, really. Every apartment around here goes for over a thousand dollars a month, you know? I'd never heard a peep about any missing persons, and neither had any of my buddies. Maybe it's the struggle, the daily grind. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, worried about making ends meet. Things are pricey, but we've learned to be clever with our money over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty charm of second-hand toys and clothes that have seen better days. You lose that new car smell pretty fast in adulthood. Maybe you pick up a habit like smoking, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But the flea market, oh, that place always calls back to you. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, clinging to the leather even after a good wash.   \n\nThere are three thrift stores within walking distance here. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and a quirky little curio shop. Downtown is bustling, cars and people pouring into the streets every morning, but those thrift stores? They're peaceful sanctuaries. No matter how many people or cars go by, the inside is quiet. It's a perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon. Every year, more and more people and cars seem to flood in. They say it's a developing city, growing pains and all. It reminds me a bit of New York, actually. Everyone here is focused on their own goals, and no one really expects much from you. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like back home, where showing a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into your life, not really. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city just keeps rolling on like waves on the beach. \n\nIt's a vibrant place to be, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we're less like strangers in an apartment building and more like a community of friends. We come together when we need to, for birthdays, funerals, to help each other out. I feel lucky to be here, truthfully. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them a little treat now and then, and they do the same for me. We bring each other mail, lend a hand when needed. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. \n\nI live in this massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "My neighbourhood, well, it's like a picture postcard of suburbia, you know?  Everything's so... neat.  The homeowner's association, they're like the invisible hand making sure everything's just so. Every house looks pretty much the same - a little patch of grass, some fancy rocks, a short driveway, maybe a little tree here and there.  And, of course, every house has a two-car garage. The roads are spotless, not a pothole in sight, all freshly paved.  Most are single-story, but you'll find some two-story ones sprinkled in.  \n\nNow, about the mailboxes -  they're not your typical kind. No individual boxes out front, no sir. It's more like an apartment building, a whole cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street. And there are these big lockers for packages too. Gotta love that HOA love for uniformity. \n\nSince my house sits on the edge of the city, our neighborhood's kind of a mix of country and suburb. We've got tons of space! There are community pools, all fancy and gated, and walking trails where you can take your dog or just go for a peaceful stroll. No need to go to a park for some exercise, you can just run around the neighborhood and get a good workout. \n\nMost folks here are retired, it's a really safe place, everyone looks out for each other. But there are some middle-aged and young professionals sprinkled in too. \n\nThe city itself is a bit of a paradox -  huge by population, but still feels small town cozy.  We've got most of the things you need, like that one mall - not huge, but it does the trick.  It's about a 15-minute drive to get anywhere interesting, but once you get there, there are tons of stores to choose from - fancy organic grocery stores, bargain outlets with just a handful of things and barely any staff... you name it. \n\nSo yeah, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, pretty typical, really.  We've got our community things like pools and trails, and while we're not right next to shopping, it's just a quick drive to anything you could want.",
            "My little corner of the world is a small town, just outside the big city buzz. It feels kinda like everyone knows each other here.  My street, on the east side, it's where the folks who don't have much money live. The houses are older, and most folks are renting. But you know what? It's not bad.  My neighbors, they're like family. Always a friendly wave and a hello when we pass each other.  Things happen, sometimes things get rough, but it's not like it's a scary place. There's been some drama, a few bad things, like shootings and stuff.  Our neighbors next door, they lost their boy last year.  It was heartbreaking.  Luckily, nothing too bad has ever happened to us directly.  Maybe something goes missing from the porch now and then, but that's about it.\n\nThis whole town, it's been hit hard by those \"opioid\" problems you hear about.  It's sad, folks losing their lives to that stuff. But there are good people here. They're trying to help. There are places where folks can get help with addiction, and folks are learning how to use that Narcan thing to save lives.  It's a tough situation, but people are trying.\n\nThere are a lot of good things here too. My son, he goes to a great school. The teachers and everyone there, they're amazing.  He's got special needs, but no one has ever bothered him. The school is so positive, he loves it there. We've got a strong parent group that always has fun events going on.  \n\nBecause so many families here struggle, the school makes sure every kid gets breakfast and lunch for free. No one ever has to worry about going hungry.  They don't judge anyone for not having a lot of money.  School stuff is also really affordable.  \n\nThe city folks have been working hard to make things look nicer.  They've fixed up the roads, planted flowers, and spruced up the parks.  But mostly, they've been focusing on the center of town, where the stores and restaurants are.  My side of town, it seems like it gets left behind sometimes.  That's a bummer, but I still like it here.  \n\nWe've been here for over 16 years. Our house isn't fancy, but it's home.  The people are kind, the schools are great, we've got everything we need, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a place with a story, ya know? Perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of times gone by. I live in a seven-story apartment building, right across from an old theater, its curtain still waiting for its next act. Just down the street, a cool little arcade bar draws in all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Come June and July, especially on weekends, you'll see a line stretching out the door, just buzzing with anticipation. A few blocks up, there's a city park, a green haven in the heart of it all. It's a decent size for this part of town, surrounded by concrete and these tall, sturdy stairs built right into the wall. In the winter, when the cold bites deep and the rain comes pouring down, you see them - folks without homes, setting up their tents in neat little rows along the sidewalk and those wide steps. They huddle close, seeking warmth in numbers,  closer to the city center than the wilderness. It's not far to the family center, either, where they can find a hot shower and a moment of peace.  But what I love most about this place, it's not the history etched into the buildings, the proud structures reaching for the sky or the way the architecture spills down the hills towards the ocean. No, it's the people. You see, Hilltop, once known as the most dangerous place on the West Coast, still carries the weight of its past. Stories linger, whispers passed down through generations, even three decades later, of the feds and the DEA sweeping through, trying to cleanse the streets. The people remember. \n\nThey work hard, even though folks still whisper about the rough edges of Hilltop. They care about their corner of the world, about keeping it clean, about keeping it theirs. Some folks say, \"Don't walk around Hilltop after dark if you're white,\" but I think that's just a shadow of the old days, a lingering echo of fear and prejudice. Maybe it's because I walk with a shade that blends in, or maybe Hilltop sees a kindred spirit in me, someone who knows the sting of prejudice, the weight of assumptions.  I know one thing: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. The streets pulse with a life that makes me feel alive. I've walked those streets in the dark, met people who'd offer me a jacket before they'd think to rob me. The laundromat owner left her store open late so I could charge my phone when the rain trapped me outside.  On the coldest nights, huddled in the shadow of a shop front, I felt invisible until someone stopped, looked me in the eye, and handed me five dollars, whispering, \"You're beautiful, you're valuable.\"  Hilltop is a place where kindness is a language everyone understands.",
            "My life unfolds in the heart of rural America, nestled amidst  the rolling farmland and charming tourist towns of small-town Michigan. It's a place where you won't find the bustling energy of big city malls, the familiar giants like Walmart or Target, or even a casual dining spot like Applebee's. Everything requires a little drive, a journey that takes you through the picturesque landscape.  But despite the lack of urban conveniences, I live in a slice of paradise, surrounded by the shimmering allure of water. My little town is cradled between the majestic Lake Michigan and the serene beauty of Lake Charlevoix. Every direction you turn, you'll find a beach beckoning you to dip your toes into its cool embrace.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the true spirit of small-town living. Houses stand proudly, each with its own unique story, some boasting updated interiors while others retain their vintage charm. Basements, the kind you can peek into from the street, are a common sight, and the houses wear their colorful aluminum siding like badges of honor.  Here, you'll find a kaleidoscope of colors adorning the blocks, a testament to the individuality of its residents. Most homes have yards, spaces where children's laughter echoes as they bounce on trampolines or swing on playsets. Gardens bloom with vibrant flowers, and fences enclose furry companions, creating a tapestry of life and family. \n\nIt's a neighborhood that reflects the heart of Middle America, a place where hard-working folks strive to build a life for themselves and their families. The streets are alive with the joyful sounds of children playing, dogs barking, and the rhythmic whir of bikes and rollerblades. The sense of community is tangible; neighbors greet each other with waves and smiles, forming a network of support and familiarity.  \n\nThe lawns are meticulously maintained, free from the clutter of fallen leaves and boasting emerald green grass.  Gardens are meticulously pruned, and bushes are trimmed to perfection, creating an atmosphere of order and care. This isn't a neighborhood that boasts ostentatious mansions, but a place that whispers, \"welcome home.\" It's a haven where families feel safe and secure, a place to put down roots and watch your children grow.\n\nJust a stone's throw away, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, a symbol of security and order.  The Health department is a close neighbor, ensuring the well-being of the community.  The recycling center stands ready to serve the needs of residents. \n\nThe sound of baseball games fills the air as children and adults alike enjoy the thrill of the game. Nearby, the small town airport hums with activity, the rumble of planes taking off and landing a constant reminder of the world beyond.  A local ice cream parlor beckons with its sweet aroma, and a short stroll takes you to the heart of downtown.  My children can ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away, where they can spend hours of carefree joy."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My city's like a melting pot, you know?  It's got these huge parts with tons of shops and businesses all mixed in with regular neighborhoods. There are all sorts of places to grab a bite or find something cool to buy, from big brand names to these cute little shops that pop up everywhere. You can practically walk to them from your house, which is kind of nice.  And there are parks sprinkled around, perfect for families with kids. \n\nThe coolest thing is how different everyone is! We've got a whole area with a big LGBTQ+ community, a group of Orthodox Jews, and a bunch of folks who came over from the former Soviet Union. Then, just a little further out, you've got all these other nationalities living in their own little neighborhoods: Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more. It's crazy how close they all are, but traffic makes it feel like a million miles away sometimes.\n\nI mean, driving just ten miles can take forever, especially during rush hour.  Most people just stay in their cars, though.  No one really walks around here, so it's no surprise that we've got some of the worst traffic in the world. Finding a parking spot is a nightmare! Plus, they keep building tons of new apartment buildings, so it seems like the city is just getting bigger and busier.\n\nBut hey, not everyone wants to live in a huge apartment building. There are still houses, all shapes and sizes, and smaller apartment complexes scattered around. Some have single-family homes, some have duplexes. My neighborhood is a mix of everything, and the people are all ages.  Honestly, I don't know most of my neighbors.  It's not like the old days when I'd play outside with the kids from down the street all the time.  It's not quite as tight-knit anymore.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a place where stories unfold. Mostly, you see those classic single-family houses, but a few have been split in two, like twins sharing a hug. My place has a little patch of grass out front and a tiny driveway, kinda like everyone else's. It's a remnant of a time when living in the suburbs was the big dream, you know? Like, it felt like everyone was reaching for it. But now, it's like that dream's fading a little. Still, my neighborhood, and others like it, hold onto that feeling, whispering that the dream is still out there.  \n\nThe folks aren't as bright-eyed as they used to be, and the lawns aren't as perfect. But there's always a car or two in the driveways, and the kids, they play like the whole world is right there in front of them. The old school, almost 90 years young, still stands tall, promising a future to the young ones and bringing back memories for the older folks. The churches are scattered, mostly quiet, but the basketball courts, those are always buzzing.\n\nEvery house looks different, but they all feel the same, like old friends. There's a big supermarket called \"Super A,\" run by a big Yemeni family, probably the only ones around here. Most folks are African American, and the streets are wide enough for the kids to play football, stopping only to let the cars pass.  \n\nWe're a neighborhood of families, generations who've been here forever, with stories about when everyone knew everyone. There used to be a karate school, but when those karate kid movies went out of style, the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, because, well, sometimes you need a little something extra, right? There's also a tiny movie theater showing old films for a song. The young folks think it's too boring, but the older folks, they love it. A good night out without the kids, you know?\n\nWe've got this expressway cutting through town, but the entrance and exit are in the next town over. We tried to get our own exit once, the young folks were all for it, but the older folks said it would ruin the town. They talked the city council into saying no. Now they're building a new high school, and we're trying to pick a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be perfect, kinda like a symbol of who we are.",
            "Hmm, you might just whiff it the first time around, you know? It's tucked behind a shopping strip, not exactly the kind of place you'd picture as a buzzing community. But if you sneak past that old, forgotten Whole Foods and peek behind the hotels that only wake up for family reunions once in a while, you'll stumble upon a whole world you never knew existed. \n\nImagine this: there are these apartment complexes lining the road, like a bunch of Russian nesting dolls someone's taken apart and put back together in a row.  Now, the first ones you'll see have been in the news for some shady stuff, so let's not dwell on them. Appearances can be deceiving, right? But the ones next door, and the ones after that, they're a whole different story – a secret world unknown to most folks around here.\n\nJust across from those apartments, you'll find a quiet little community college campus. It's like a sleepy giant, with students shuffling in, yawning and clutching their coffee at 7 in the morning. The iron gates creak open like a sleepy sigh, letting them in one by one. Meanwhile, commuters are honking their horns and grumbling about the traffic. \n\nThe road then bumps into another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for folks who've had their share of accidents.  The center has rocking chairs on the porch and a ceiling fan that lazily whirls the hot summer air. \n\nKids are running around in the park, cartwheeling and giggling. Bees buzz around the flower patches by the road, and older folks walk their dogs, shaking their heads at the skateboarders and nodding politely at the teenage girls gossiping by the swings. \n\nThere's a sushi place in a nearby strip mall – cheap eats, but never too crowded. Right next door, there's a swimming supply store, and a nail salon tucked right in between.  You could practically get your pool ready, get a manicure, and grab some hibachi chicken all in one stop – the magic of a strip mall, right?  \n\nAnd don't forget the frozen yogurt place – the DIY kind – where teenagers are always hanging out, slurping down icy treats and pulling off skateboard tricks. They think they're so cool with their vapes, you know?\n\nThis neighborhood, it's like a snapshot of America. A piece of history frozen in time, where not much ever changes, not even time itself.",
            "Hmm...she looked around, her eyes wide with wonder. “Where is everything?” she asked, gazing at the endless expanse of cornfields that stretched as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she wouldn't believe the vastness of this open landscape.  She came from a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, her world confined to brick and mortar.  This was a whole new world for her.  \n\nOverwhelmed by the sea of corn stalks, I began to tell her about my childhood in rural Ohio, sharing stories of lazy summer days and the smell of fresh-cut hay in the air. In that moment, she finally understood where I came from, the roots that ran deep within this land.\n\nWe continued down the two-lane road, passing a quarry filled with crystal-clear water. Just past it, nestled amongst the trees, was my little development. The houses were mostly brick and stucco, each one boasting at least half an acre of land, meticulously cared for by their proud owners. Spring bursts with color as vibrant flowers bloom alongside the majestic trees that transform with every season.  And the driveways?  They were lined with gleaming Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, polished to perfection after a good old-fashioned car wash.\n\nAs we drove closer to my home, a friendly face always greeted us from the yard of our Korean neighbor. He spent his days meticulously mowing his lawn, a contented hum accompanying his work.  We all chuckled at his dedication, but his heart was always open and genuine.  He had a history filled with stories, a past life as a doctor that now mingled with the murmur of his John Deere Zero Turn mower.  He'd lost some of his youthful spark with age, but his spirit remained. \n\nFinally, we arrived at my grey stucco house.  Geese honked in the side yard, chased playfully by our energetic Terrier.  Behind the house, a small stream gurgled, feeding into the quarry, its music punctuated by the croaking of bullfrogs and the occasional moo from a nearby farm.  A hand-crafted wooden bridge led to a peaceful haven, untouched and alive with the whisper of trees, herbs, and wildflowers.  This was my childhood sanctuary, filled with the echoes of laughter and adventure.\n\nFrom building towering tree forts to \"hunting\" imaginary prey,  there was always something to do. And there were always friends to share it with. \n\nWinters in our small town were harsh, but breathtakingly beautiful.  The vibrant green transformed into a stark, empty wilderness.  The trees, once adorned with pink, purple, and orange flowers, stood bare, their branches skeletal against the winter sky. But when blessed with snow, a magical wonderland appeared overnight.  My sister and I would create snow angels and snowmen, our laughter echoing through the quiet air.  Sometimes, our winter days were filled with snowball fights, our arsenal of branches transformed into makeshift weapons. We would build massive fortresses of snow, our own icy kingdoms where imaginary worlds came to life. In that snowy realm, we were just kids, lost in a world of boundless imagination and carefree joy.",
            "My dear, you gotta understand about Portland, Oregon. It's a city that lives by its own rules, its own vibe.  The motto, painted on the side of a building that somehow manages to be a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and, let's just say, a place where the law bends a little, is \"Keep Portland Weird.\"  Some folks say it's a reminder of the old Portland, the one from the 90s and early 2000s, a hidden gem, less flashy and more affordable, where unique subcultures blossomed. Others see it as an invitation - come experience Portland, where being different isn't just tolerated, it's celebrated.  \n\nEven with all the fancy Californians moving in and the cranes constantly building new condos, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.  \"Weird\" doesn't mean everyone's always cool with everything, but it means being open to things that might make other cities raise an eyebrow. It doesn't mean we don't have our share of Starbucks and shopping malls, just that we don't take ourselves too seriously.\n\nLike, in my neighborhood, we've got houses painted in every color imaginable, gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets. And in the summer, there are these magical things called \"free boxes\" – cardboard boxes, sometimes plastic ones too, filled with someone's discarded treasures. You never know what you'll find: clothes, books, maybe even a vintage record player. It's like a treasure hunt, and it's all part of the Portland charm.\n\nThat's what Portland means to me, anyway. Just one version of \"weird\" among thousands. Some of my neighbors wouldn't dream of rummaging through a free box, they'd rather be at goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or cheering for the Timbers (our soccer team).  \n\nPortland is a city full of dreamers, people who chase their passions, even if it means spending a little too much time at the bar. Sure, we have our issues, like drug addiction and homelessness, which are, let's be honest, problems everywhere. We try to help, but it's a constant struggle.\n\nBut even with our flaws, Portland is a city that embraces its quirks, its complexities.  We're a community of artists, dreamers, and everyday people trying to make sense of the world. And in that sense, maybe \"weird\" is just another word for being human.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, standing strong in the north, watching the sun rise and set every day.  No matter how busy I get, how caught up in work and life, they're always there, solid and steady, unfazed by all the ups and downs. On those days when I'm feeling really stressed and overwhelmed, they seem to call to me. When I look at them, my worries seem to melt away, and I find a strength to keep going, one step at a time.\n\nI first fell in love with them back when I started university. The mountains north of campus were the first thing that truly captivated me. Sure, the university itself is beautiful, with its buildings, ponds, and trees,  but those mountains, they have a special place in my heart. \n\nThe town itself is charming, with its cozy cafes, perfect for those late-night study sessions fueled by caffeine. If you walk or take the bus a little further, you'll find the downtown area, filled with old buildings and a sense of history. It's like a little slice of a bustling city right in the heart of suburbia. But just a few blocks away, you can escape back to the peace and quiet of the small town, passing by the library as you go. This mix of energy and tranquility is what makes this place so special, like it's inviting you to explore.\n\nThere's a memory for every corner of this town. Whether it's walking past the old swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or racing through the downtown streets to catch a movie at the fancy theater (thanks to those free tickets from the university!). But, like any place, it holds its share of sad memories too. The ponds, in particular, have seen their fair share of tears shed during late-night existential crises.  (I've had a few of those!) Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each with a purpose, makes you wonder about your own place in the world.\n\n\nSo, I'd walk past the pond, past the park, past the houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I reached the main street. The sun was shining, painting the sky with vibrant colors as it rose above the palm trees. And as I looked up, I realized I was walking north.\n\nThere they were, just as they always had been. Those mighty mountains, towering over everything else, meeting the hazy blue and yellow sky. They seemed to say to me, without a word, \"Keep going. You've got this.\"",
            "Visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, won't leave you feeling lost! Its got that classic New York City vibe, with easy access to public transportation, which, let's be honest, is the lifeblood of the city. You'll be surrounded by the energy of the city, but with a distinct Asian flair. Over the past few years, Bensonhurst has become like a melting pot of cultures, with a whole bunch of Asian folks setting up shop. It's like one giant Asian block party, with supermarkets and laundromats popping up on practically every street corner.  \n\nAnd let me tell you, these Asian-owned businesses are the real deal! The supermarkets have the freshest ingredients at amazing prices, and the laundromats are super convenient. I can practically walk to four of them in just a couple of minutes - talk about grocery run easy! \n\nBut Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave, you know. It's a real mix of cultures, with immigrants and their kids making it their home. It's a melting pot of experiences.  \n\nThere's also a pretty sweet park nearby, all decked out with basketball courts, a soccer field, handball courts, swings, a playground - the whole shebang. It's like a mini city park, perfect for some outdoor fun. \n\nNow, there aren't any towering office buildings here. You'll mostly find apartment buildings and some cozy two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, but they're definitely loud!  \n\nJust be prepared for some engine revving and music blasting as you go about your day. And if you're out late at night, keep your wits about you. Bensonhurst is pretty safe, but like any city, there are a few unsavory characters lurking around.  I've had my share of run-ins with bullies in the past, and package theft is a bit of a problem.\n\nAnd hey, even though New York City has rules about cleaning up after your dog, some people just don't play by them. So watch your step, ya know? Dog waste is a bit of an epidemic here!",
            "Hmm...my neighborhood...it's like everything's on a slant.  Our house sits right at the top of the steepest hill, the one everyone calls \"the workout hill\" because all the runners use it.  It's funny, there aren't any sidewalks, so everyone, even cars, have to share the road.  It gets a bit bumpy and scary sometimes.  The wires hanging around are a mess, all tangled and patched up from that constant rain we get.  The big trees are everywhere, but people here don't like them much. They want to chop them down because they block the view of the ocean.  That's why all the houses are built up so high, like giant eyes peering out at the water.  It's beautiful at sunset, though, when the water glows and the sky turns orange.  But it's mostly cloudy here, so you see the sun through a veil of mist.  Everything gets damp and mossy, even cars!  Once, I left my car parked for a month and it turned green and fuzzy.  It took forever to scrape it all off.\n\nThere aren't many kids around. There's a school nearby, but mostly it's older folks, retired folks, living here.  Instead of children, everyone has dogs.  They're everywhere, lounging in yards or chasing each other down the street.  I had one sneak into my living room once!  We also have rabbits, big ones, that gardeners hate because they dig up everything.  My cats love to hunt them, though.  Oh, and we have birds, little sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes even hawks or eagles, until the crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops close by, but if you walk down to the water, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood.  The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks are fun to throw in the water.  The bay is small, you can see the other side even on foggy days.",
            "Life in our little corner of Tennessee is kinda like a slow, sweet song. You know, the kind that makes you feel all cozy and right at home.  We live on a street that links two big roads, so there's more traffic than I'd like, but it's a quiet neighborhood for the most part. Folks mostly keep to themselves, fussing over their yards or doing their daily chores. It's like a big family, everyone knows everyone.  We're at the front corner, so we see all the comings and goings. We know whose car is who's, and if something new rolls by, well, we notice. Some neighbors like to stroll around, maybe with their pups, and the kids are always whizzing by on their bikes. \n\nWe work from home, me and my wife, and our two girls, eleven and fourteen, are always on the go too.  So, yeah, everyone's used to us being around. We're always outside, even when it's drizzling. There's something about the smell of a barbecue on a sunny afternoon that makes everything just right. And you can bet your bottom dollar there's always a lawnmower going, especially from spring to fall.  We've got a bunch of trees around here, so there's plenty of shade, but come autumn, those leaves gotta go! We rake 'em up and burn 'em. I gotta admit, I kinda love that smell, it means fall is here.\n\nWe don't see much of a winter these days, so it's just a long stretch of fall, kind of like a never-ending autumn. Our garage is at the back, so the front door stays mostly closed, unless someone's knocking. I like tinkering in the garage with my truck and other projects, and when those doors are open, it feels like I'm closer to the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving, when all the families are gathering and cars are parked everywhere. Christmas and Mother's Day are the same way. But overall, I wouldn't trade this place for the world. If it wasn't for the traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood, man, it's like smack dab in the middle of nowhere.  Dirt, dirt, and more dirt, as far as the eye can see. You wouldn't believe it unless you lived here. It's like everyone else is living in a green paradise, with those manicured lawns that cost a fortune.  \n\nBack in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were spread out like nobody's business. Now it's kinda the same, but there's a ton more places popping up.  It's getting more and more like a city every day, which is kinda sad, you know?  I guess everywhere is changing like that.  The people are mostly friendly, but like any place, you have your good and bad.  I'm surrounded by these really cool old folks, so it's a pretty nice neighborhood.\n\nThe stores here?  Mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final.  If you want something fancy, you gotta drive a ways.  There's no Whole Foods or anything like that.  I think most people here work in construction.  Makes sense, right?  This place is still growing like crazy, so there's tons of building going on.  It freaks me out a little, though. I like things the way they are. I moved away from a big city, and I'm not going back, no way. \n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living.  Drywall and T-bar installation.  \n\nWhat I love most about living here is the animals. People come to the high desert for all kinds of reasons, but the unique wildlife is a big draw.  The desert is a tough place to live, and the animals that make it their home are tough too. It's important for us to learn about them and share this space with them. My kids are obsessed with lizards and bugs.  They're out there right now trying to catch 'em all! \n\nAs for things to do, we've got a few attractions. Victorville is a great place for families, it's a different kind of vacation. If you come here, try to catch the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast! And if you want to see snow, head up to Wrightwood for some winter sports. \n\nIf you're into history and nature, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-see. They've got fossils, Native American artifacts, and stuff about how Victorville grew up.",
            "Hmm, my neighborhood? Well, it's a bit different from what most people might picture. You see, instead of houses and yards, my neighborhood is the college campus I call home. My roommates and fellow dorm dwellers are my community, and the surrounding campus, my extended neighborhood, even if it's not as close-knit.  Even though it's unique, my neighborhood shares similarities with those traditional ones. We've got \"houses\" of sorts, folks, shops, and even a park, just like any other place. Let me tell you about these \"houses.\"  There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dorm rooms. In the apartments, you'll find a few people sharing each room, with a handful of rooms on each floor.  The buildings are usually two stories tall, meaning about 20 people live in each one. Then there are the actual houses, available for rent to anyone connected to the school. These are usually 2-4 bedroom places, mostly occupied by alumni. But there aren't many of these scattered around. Lastly, we have the dorm rooms, the most common type of housing here. Hundreds of students live in these, with two people sharing each room, with a few exceptions.  My school is a melting pot of cultures and ages, and that's reflected in my neighborhood. The staff members mostly live in the houses, while newer students stay in the dorms and the older ones in the apartments. Describing everyone here would be impossible, so let's move on to the shops and park. Being self-contained, our campus has plenty of stores and a single park.  We've got all the usual dining options you'd find in any neighborhood, plus the school's own unique clothing and grocery stores. You can find anything you need right here! And the park? It's a place for everyone to enjoy, always clean and safe thanks to the watchful eyes of our diverse community.",
            "Hmm...ten years have flown by since I landed here in this neighborhood.  Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I gotta admit, a few tears were shed. Saying goodbye to my old life, my friends, my roots, it was tough, you know? But my parents, they always wanted the best for me and my little sis.  A better place to live, a better school, a \"fancier\" neighborhood, as they put it.  At first, it was a big adjustment. Making new friends, facing new faces, some even turned into rivals. But hey, that's life, right?\n\nThe only neighbors who really felt like family were Mr. Glen and his kids, and for a while, Dennis too, since he lived right next door. They were always so welcoming, always up for a good time. I'll never forget Mr. Glen's wedding to Ms. Veda.  It was a blast! Dancing the night away, catching the little white strap she threw (didn't get the flowers though, ah well!),  and just enjoying the company. Marsharii, one of their daughters, we really hit it off that night. Wish I could catch up with her sometime.\n\nThis neighborhood can be like a maze, but these days I have a GPS, so I'm starting to explore more.  Mostly, I stick to familiar paths, like the ones I used to walk with Kason and Curtis. We were all about those video games back in the day, living life to the fullest, you know?  \n\nSometimes, I'd escape to the park, just to soak in the peace and quiet. It's like a pressure valve for me, a way to clear my head and find some inner calm. I even practice my balance with some sticks I bought from Home Depot, and sometimes I bring my bokken wooden sword for some extra fun.  \n\nThere's a basketball court and a tennis court too, though I haven't touched a tennis racket or a basketball in ages. Still, it's nice to know they're there if I ever feel like dusting them off. My dad and his friend Mr. Graves were big tennis fans, they really pushed me and my best friend to play.  Those were good times, tough but fun.\n\nSo yeah, this neighborhood has been good to me.  There are so many memories, so many stories.  I've had my ups and downs, but the best is yet to come, I know it!",
            "Hmm...my neighborhood, it's kinda like a mixed bag, you know? It's close to my college, which is a big plus, gotta love that convenience.  Mostly apartments, yeah, like a whole block of 'em. There are a few restaurants and bars, nothing fancy, but fun enough for a night out. One bar just got a makeover, but it got a bit pricier,  still not bad though. The crowd there is mostly college kids or folks who, well, let's just say they're not rolling in dough.  It's kinda like a melting pot, you know?  There are tons of kids around because there's this elementary school just a stone's throw away.\n\nI don't really know my neighbors, and honestly, I'm kinda cool with that.  They're a bit...enthusiastic about their weed-smoking, so the building management put this air freshener thing right outside their door. It's like, 'Hey, we know you're in there, but we're gonna try to mask the smell!' It's kinda funny, in a sad way. \n\nThe buildings around here are a bit old school, but some of them have gotten a facelift inside, which is nice.  Down the street, there are these brand new apartments that popped up, but they're a total scam. They look shiny and new on the outside, but the construction is shoddy. They're charging a fortune for a place that's barely worth half the rent, but hey, they're near campus, so they can get away with it, right?\n\nThere's this hole-in-the-wall restaurant around the corner that serves food on paper plates.  Most of it's microwaved, but it's cheap, so you can't really complain. And right next to that is a gas station, which, from what I hear, is a terrible place to work. But hey, they fixed up the road last summer with some city money, so now there's a nice sidewalk, grassy patches, and it's all spruced up.\n\nMy building is kind of hidden away under a canopy of trees. They chopped down a few of them, leaving these stumps, but there are way more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments.  My street is 42nd, but right behind me is 43rd, and that one's a bit rougher.  \n\nThe sidewalks are crumbling, and most of the buildings look like they're about to fall apart.  They've got a lot of trees there too, probably to hide the state of things. Most of the crime in the area seems to be around that apartment complex, but hey, I can't judge them alone. There are some buildings across the street from me with a pretty high turnover rate and a whole lot of trouble.\n\nBut you know what? I kinda like it here. It's affordable, and I've got all the essentials within reach.  I especially love being able to walk to school and having bus stops right outside my door for trips to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is like a little slice of simpler times.  It's full of these cute duplexes, spaced out so they look like little individual houses.  They're all painted yellow with white porches and those shiny green roofs, like something out of a storybook.  Most of the folks here know each other, and you'll often find us hanging out at the end of the driveways, chatting while the kids run around playing. It's so nice to have this kind of connection, especially in a world that feels so fast-paced and digital all the time.  It's like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees, with the blue sky and those fluffy white clouds. \n\nOf course, living in the South has its quirks.  This season, we've been dealing with some scary tornado warnings. Last night, we actually heard the sirens go off, so we all scrambled for shelter.  Me? I ended up in the bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and a couple of pillows for comfort. My big guy wasn't too keen on the bathroom idea and stayed in the living room, pacing and barking nervously.   \n\nThe whole neighborhood went quiet except for the sound of big hailstones crashing down. After the storm passed, the road looked like it was steaming from the sudden temperature change. It went from a sweltering 92 degrees to a more bearable 75 in just minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement instantly.  As the clouds cleared, the sun came out and it started to rain again. But this wasn't just any rain...a double rainbow appeared!  I ran inside, grabbed my camera, and snapped a few pictures to share with my friends and family on Facebook. They were amazed, just like me.  It was magical.\n\nThe neighborhood was quiet for another hour or so until folks started trickling back home, shaken but safe. Then it was back to normal - moms and kids outside, dinner cooking on the stove. I love this friendly neighborhood. It's been a welcome change after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I especially love the way folks talk down here, with their warm Southern accents.\n\nI live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, just like everyone else.  While the outside looks the same, the insides are all different. Some are pretty tiny, which seems weird to me. \n\nI love to walk over to the big field behind my apartment and head down to the pond.  I've seen deer there, and in the morning, you can hear this huge bullfrog singing his heart out. It's a beautiful place to live, just a hop, skip, and a jump from Charlotte. Every morning starts with the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It feels like we live in our own little village, with everyone looking out for each other. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm who brays in the evening, reminding us he's there. I feel so lucky to have found this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "Hmm...moving to this new place was like starting eighth grade all over again.  Making friends felt like a million miles away at first. But then, something magical happened.  Two familiar faces popped up, one just two houses down, the other right on my street.  We were close, thick as thieves, but life, as it does, took them away.  They're gone now, but the memories, they're still here, like little whispers in the wind.  Most of the folks who were here when I first moved in are still around, like old friends, always waving hello. \n\nThis neighborhood, it's like any other, you know?  Two-story houses lined up neat and tidy. On warm days, the sound of kids laughing and playing drifts through the air, making it feel like a big, happy family.  It's quiet most days, everyone minding their own business, but always there if you need them.  I've never had a problem with anyone here, not even a single frown.  It's a safe place, a haven.  I've ordered countless things online, packages piling up on my porch, and not a single one has ever gone missing.  There's a trust here, a sense of community that's hard to find these days. \n\nJust a hop, skip, and a jump from my door is a little park, a place where so many memories have been made.  Basketball games, football throws, baseball swings...I remember it all so clearly, the smell of freshly cut grass, the sound of laughter.  There was a time when I got elbowed right in the nose during a football game, a memory that still stings a little.  But those good times, the ones with scraped knees and muddy faces, they far outweigh the bad. Now, whenever I go to the park, it's to watch my cousin's little ones squeal with delight as they zoom down the slides and climb the monkey bars.  Seeing them there, it fills me with a warmth that spreads through my whole heart.  It's a trip down memory lane, a reminder of simpler times.  \n\nThis neighborhood, it's a melting pot of cultures, a symphony of flavors.  You can find anything you crave, just steps away.  Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian...all within a stone's throw.  These days, everyone's glued to their phones, ordering everything through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food reigns supreme, but you can find it everywhere, like a constant companion.  And pizza?  Oh, pizza is a religion here.  There are a dozen places within a mile radius, all vying for your taste buds.  \n\nWe have everything we need right here.  Dry cleaners, pharmacies, grocery stores...it's like a mini city.  There's even a little Indian store, tucked away like a treasure, where you can find spices and ingredients to cook up a storm.  It's a neighborhood where I feel truly at home.  Seeing the stories on social media, hearing the news about people's struggles with their neighbors, it makes me grateful for the peace and safety I have here.",
            "My hometown, Johnston, is just a little speck on the map of South Carolina.  It ain't fancy, but it's got a heart of gold, especially when it comes to those juicy peaches! Everyone around here knows Johnston as the Peach Capital of the World – you can even see it on the welcome sign as you drive in.  The landscape is mostly fields, either bursting with peaches or grazing cows.  \n\nThe houses scattered around town are mostly two stories high, with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or those classic gray shingles. You won't see them right on the road, though. They're tucked back a ways, leaving plenty of space for animals and crops out front. \n\nThe heart of town is where you'll find the only stoplight in the whole place, right at the four-way intersection. That's where all the stores are, too – not a whole lot, but enough to get by.  You've got Hong Kong, a tiny Chinese place run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant for a taste of south-of-the-border, and Gary's, a small burger joint.  There used to be a pizza place, but it closed up shop a while back. For your medicine needs, there's Maxwell and Halford Drug, a real old-fashioned pharmacy.  They're famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola, which is a local legend!\n\nThe grocery store is called Independent Grocers Alliance, but everyone just calls it IGA. It's small and a bit pricey, so most folks head over to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their big shopping trips. \n\nBut let me tell you, the real heart of Johnston is Dollar General. It's always bustling with people picking up everyday essentials. And then there's Possibilities Furniture & More, a sweet little furniture store run by a lovely woman who knows everyone in town. They even have movers to help you get your new couch up the stairs!  Right next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where they take care of your furry friends with everything from grooming to boarding. \n\nThe doctor's office and the vet are a little ways out from the main drag, but they're both good folks who take care of the town's health. And for the little ones, there's Johnston Elementary School.  After fifth grade, though, they have to head over to the next town for middle and high school.\n\nWe don't have any fancy parks or playgrounds, but we're working on a new recreational area. It'll be nice to have a place for families to gather and for folks to come and visit. \n\nLife in Johnston is pretty laid-back. There aren't a lot of things to do, no movie theaters or bowling alleys or anything like that. But it's a good place to live. It's small enough that you feel like everyone knows you, and it's got a real sense of community.",
            "My first glimpse into this neighborhood came from a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit of a shock, to be honest. Most apartments around here were going for over a thousand dollars a month, and I'd never heard a whisper about any missing folks. Maybe it's just the struggle we all face. I know a few friends who cry themselves to sleep at night.  Living costs are high, but we've learned to be resourceful, you know? We find beauty in the dusty charm of flea market treasures and those old mothballed clothes. You learn to smell less grown-up stuff, maybe you pick up a smoke habit, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But that flea market smell, it always sticks with you. It's like the scent of adulthood – dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, clinging to the leather even after you wash it.\n\nWe're lucky here, three thrift stores within walking distance. You can start on one end and hit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curiosity shop, all in a row. Downtown's a different story, bustling with cars and people every morning, but it's a different world inside those thrift stores. No matter how much traffic passes by, it's quiet in there. A perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon.\n\nEvery year, things seem to get a little crazier. More cars, more people flooding the streets. They call it a developing city, I guess. With a giant online empire for shopping and deliveries setting up shop here, it's going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York, everyone focused on their own goals, not really asking much from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and no one bats an eye. It's different from the South, where a little bit of concern means you really care. Here, people mind their own business. You can keep your walls up as long as you like, and the city just rolls on, like waves on the beach.\n\nIt's a lively place, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. We might not have a traditional apartment building full of strangers, but we're more like a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, lend a hand when we can. I feel lucky to be here. I get along with most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to be considerate, clean up after myself, leave them some food, and they do the same for me. We bring each other letters and packages. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs.\n\nI live in a huge, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "Hmm... living here is like stepping into one of those picture-perfect cookie cutter suburbs you see in the movies. You know, the kind where everyone's house looks exactly the same? Yeah, that's pretty much my neighborhood. The homeowner's association, bless their hearts, makes sure everything is spotless.  Every house is a single-family home, all with manicured lawns, little patches of decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Every once in a while, you'll see a small tree trying to add some character, but for the most part, it's all very uniform.  And speaking of uniform, everyone has a two-car garage.  Even the roads are all newly paved and spotless.  You won't find any potholes or cracks here, which is a nice change of pace.\n\nMost of the houses are single-story, but you'll see a few two-story ones sprinkled in.  Oh, and forget about those cute little mailboxes in front of each house.  We've got a giant, apartment-style mailbox cluster at the end of the street. You need a key to access your own box, just like in an apartment complex.  Think of it as the HOA's way of keeping things looking neat and tidy. \n\nMy house is right on the edge of the city, so it's kind of a mix between rural and suburban.  We've got a ton of land, which is great because we have multiple community pools that everyone can use. They're always well-kept and have those fancy gates, like a private resort. And there are loads of walking trails for those who like to stroll or take their dogs for a walk. You don't even need to go to a park!  You can just walk or run around the neighborhood and get your exercise in. \n\nMost of the people here are retired, which makes for a really peaceful atmosphere. It's super safe, and everyone looks out for each other. There are a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in, but for the most part, it's a quiet and friendly neighborhood.\n\nThe city itself is surprisingly big, even though it has this small-town vibe. We've got all the basics: a single mall (it's not huge, but it does the job!), a few different grocery stores (from fancy organic ones to bargain outlets), and all the other essentials you'd expect.  It's about a 15-minute drive to get to anything major, but once you're there, you've got plenty of options. \n\nOverall, my neighborhood is pretty typical, safe, well-maintained, and has a lot of nice things like pools and walking trails.  It's not exactly exciting, but it's comfortable and convenient.",
            "My town is like a little world tucked away from the big city, not too far but still its own thing.  It feels like that old saying, \"small town, big heart.\"  My part of town, on the east side, isn't fancy. The houses aren't worth much, and most folks here are just trying to make ends meet. But you know what? It's not a bad place. People are always smiling and saying hello when I walk by. Sure, there's been a few bumps in the road, like a couple of shootings and even a murder a few blocks over. It's sad, especially when  our neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting.  That's the thing about small towns, everything feels closer, you know? \n\n\nWe've been lucky, though. Nothing too bad has happened to us directly, just the usual stuff like someone taking our stuff off the porch if we forget to bring it in.\n\nBut the whole town has been hit hard by this whole drug thing, the opioid epidemic. It's taken so many good people. But there are people who care, there are places here that help folks get better, and people are trying to make things right.\n\nThe good news is, the school my son goes to is amazing. The teachers, the principal, everyone there is so good, they make you feel like your kid is the only one that matters. My son is a little different, but he's never felt picked on, never felt like he didn't belong. They really do take care of everyone there. \n\nAnd the best part? The school feeds every kid breakfast and lunch for free. They don't want anyone going hungry. It's a big deal because a lot of families here struggle to make ends meet. \n\nThe town itself is working hard to be better too. They've fixed up the roads, planted flowers, and made the parks nicer. It's just that most of that work has been done on the other side of town, where all the stores and stuff are.  We get a little left out over here on the east side.\n\nBut you know what?  We have our own things here too. We have a tight-knit community, good people, and a place that feels like home.  \n\nIt's not perfect, but we love it here. We've been here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine going anywhere else.",
            "My neighbourhood, it's a tapestry woven with stories.  It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of times gone by. My home is a seven-story apartment building, right across from the old live theater, a place where the ghosts of forgotten performances still linger. Just down the hill, there's this small arcade bar, a haven for all sorts of folks, especially on warm summer nights.  Lines form, stretching down the block, especially in June and July, as if the warmth draws them in like moths to a flame. A few blocks up, there's the city park, a green oasis in the heart of it all. It's bigger than you'd expect for this part of town, encircled by concrete with grand, sweeping stairs carved into its walls.\n\nWhen winter's icy grip tightens its hold, the park becomes a temporary home for those who have nowhere else to go.  They set up their tents in neat rows, huddled together for warmth against the biting winds and relentless rain.  It's not snow that chills them, but the lack of shelter.  Being together, in the heart of the city, keeps them a little warmer, a little safer. They're also within reach of the nearest family center, a beacon of hope where they can find a hot shower and a moment of respite.\n\nBut what truly makes my neighborhood special, what binds us together, isn't the history etched into the buildings or the charming architecture that spills down the rolling hills towards the ocean. It's the people, their stories, their resilience. Hilltop, you see, once wore a darker crown, notorious for gang violence that echoed through its streets.  The memories linger, whispered tales passed down through generations, stories of federal crackdowns and the DEA's relentless pursuit.  The people remember, though they've worked hard, even in the shadow of that past, to clean up the streets, to reclaim their neighborhood.  They still care, fiercely, about what happens in their corner of the world. \n\nThey say, with a hint of caution, that if you're white, you shouldn't walk alone at night. A relic of the past, perhaps, a reminder of a time when fear ruled, when assumptions were made, and prejudice cast its long shadow. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees something in me, a kindred spirit who recognizes the deep-seated scars of injustice.  We are both painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation, the echoes of racism, cultural conditioning, and fear disguised as ignorance.\n\nBut I know this: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. The pulse of the city beats strongest here, and I feel alive walking its streets, bathed in the warm glow of streetlights. I meet people who offer me a jacket before I can even ask, who see beyond the surface and offer a genuine connection. It's a place where the laundromat owner stays open a little later so I can charge my phone in the pouring rain, and where someone stops and hands me five dollars, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable on the bleakest of nights.  This is where I belong.",
            "My life is a slice of Americana, right here in small-town Michigan. It's like stepping back in time, with rolling farmland giving way to quaint tourist spots. Forget those big city chains - no bustling malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee's in sight!  You gotta hop in the car to get to anything, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.  You see, I live surrounded by the kind of beauty that takes your breath away. \n\nMy little town sits nestled between two shimmering lakes - Lake Michigan on one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other.  Beaches are practically on every corner, just begging for a dip. \n\nMy neighborhood? It's like stepping into a postcard of Middle America.  Houses aren't stacked on top of each other like in the city; they're unique, each with its own story to tell.  Some have been updated, some are vintage beauties, but they all have that cozy charm. Most have full basements peeking out from the ground, and the colors just paint a happy picture - every shade imaginable!  \n\nOut front, you'll find gardens bursting with life, playful trampolines bouncing with kids, and swings sets creaking with laughter. Some folks even have fences for their furry friends. \n\nThis is where hard-working families thrive. You see kids zipping around on bikes, dogs getting their afternoon stroll, neighbors waving and chatting. Everyone knows everyone, and you can tell who belongs and who's just passing through. \n\nThe lawns are perfect, green and manicured, not a single fallen leaf out of place. It's not about fancy mansions, but about that feeling of home and belonging.\n\nIt's a quiet place, peaceful and safe - the kind of place where you can raise a family and build a life.  The Sheriff's department and jail are just down the road, keeping things safe, and the Health department is right next door.  The recycling center is always buzzing, and everyone uses it.   \n\nBaseball games echo through the air, with excited announcers calling out plays, and nearby, the small airport's planes take off and land, adding a touch of adventure to the everyday.  If you're craving ice cream, you can stroll a few blocks to the local shop, and if you're feeling adventurous, you can even bike downtown.  The park is just around the corner, perfect for a family picnic. \n\nIt may not be glamorous, but it's where my heart belongs. It's a special place, a haven where people feel safe and connected."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My city's like a melting pot, you know?  It's got these huge parts with tons of shops and businesses all mixed in with regular neighborhoods. There are all sorts of places to grab a bite or find something cool to buy, from big brand names to these cute little shops that pop up everywhere. You can practically walk to them from your house, which is kind of nice.  And there are parks sprinkled around, perfect for families with kids. \n\nThe coolest thing is how different everyone is! We've got a whole area with a big LGBTQ+ community, a group of Orthodox Jews, and a bunch of folks who came over from the former Soviet Union. Then, just a little further out, you've got all these other nationalities living in their own little neighborhoods: Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more. It's crazy how close they all are, but traffic makes it feel like a million miles away sometimes.\n\nI mean, driving just ten miles can take forever, especially during rush hour.  Most people just stay in their cars, though.  No one really walks around here, so it's no surprise that we've got some of the worst traffic in the world. Finding a parking spot is a nightmare! Plus, they keep building tons of new apartment buildings, so it seems like the city is just getting bigger and busier.\n\nBut hey, not everyone wants to live in a huge apartment building. There are still houses, all shapes and sizes, and smaller apartment complexes scattered around. Some have single-family homes, some have duplexes. My neighborhood is a mix of everything, and the people are all ages.  Honestly, I don't know most of my neighbors.  It's not like the old days when I'd play outside with the kids from down the street all the time.  It's not quite as tight-knit anymore.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a place where stories unfold. Mostly, you see those classic single-family houses, but a few have been split in two, like twins sharing a hug. My place has a little patch of grass out front and a tiny driveway, kinda like everyone else's. It's a remnant of a time when living in the suburbs was the big dream, you know? Like, it felt like everyone was reaching for it. But now, it's like that dream's fading a little. Still, my neighborhood, and others like it, hold onto that feeling, whispering that the dream is still out there.  \n\nThe folks aren't as bright-eyed as they used to be, and the lawns aren't as perfect. But there's always a car or two in the driveways, and the kids, they play like the whole world is right there in front of them. The old school, almost 90 years young, still stands tall, promising a future to the young ones and bringing back memories for the older folks. The churches are scattered, mostly quiet, but the basketball courts, those are always buzzing.\n\nEvery house looks different, but they all feel the same, like old friends. There's a big supermarket called \"Super A,\" run by a big Yemeni family, probably the only ones around here. Most folks are African American, and the streets are wide enough for the kids to play football, stopping only to let the cars pass.  \n\nWe're a neighborhood of families, generations who've been here forever, with stories about when everyone knew everyone. There used to be a karate school, but when those karate kid movies went out of style, the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, because, well, sometimes you need a little something extra, right? There's also a tiny movie theater showing old films for a song. The young folks think it's too boring, but the older folks, they love it. A good night out without the kids, you know?\n\nWe've got this expressway cutting through town, but the entrance and exit are in the next town over. We tried to get our own exit once, the young folks were all for it, but the older folks said it would ruin the town. They talked the city council into saying no. Now they're building a new high school, and we're trying to pick a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be perfect, kinda like a symbol of who we are.",
            "Hmm, you might just whiff it the first time around, you know? It's tucked behind a shopping strip, not exactly the kind of place you'd picture as a buzzing community. But if you sneak past that old, forgotten Whole Foods and peek behind the hotels that only wake up for family reunions once in a while, you'll stumble upon a whole world you never knew existed. \n\nImagine this: there are these apartment complexes lining the road, like a bunch of Russian nesting dolls someone's taken apart and put back together in a row.  Now, the first ones you'll see have been in the news for some shady stuff, so let's not dwell on them. Appearances can be deceiving, right? But the ones next door, and the ones after that, they're a whole different story – a secret world unknown to most folks around here.\n\nJust across from those apartments, you'll find a quiet little community college campus. It's like a sleepy giant, with students shuffling in, yawning and clutching their coffee at 7 in the morning. The iron gates creak open like a sleepy sigh, letting them in one by one. Meanwhile, commuters are honking their horns and grumbling about the traffic. \n\nThe road then bumps into another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for folks who've had their share of accidents.  The center has rocking chairs on the porch and a ceiling fan that lazily whirls the hot summer air. \n\nKids are running around in the park, cartwheeling and giggling. Bees buzz around the flower patches by the road, and older folks walk their dogs, shaking their heads at the skateboarders and nodding politely at the teenage girls gossiping by the swings. \n\nThere's a sushi place in a nearby strip mall – cheap eats, but never too crowded. Right next door, there's a swimming supply store, and a nail salon tucked right in between.  You could practically get your pool ready, get a manicure, and grab some hibachi chicken all in one stop – the magic of a strip mall, right?  \n\nAnd don't forget the frozen yogurt place – the DIY kind – where teenagers are always hanging out, slurping down icy treats and pulling off skateboard tricks. They think they're so cool with their vapes, you know?\n\nThis neighborhood, it's like a snapshot of America. A piece of history frozen in time, where not much ever changes, not even time itself.",
            "Hmm...she looked around, her eyes wide with wonder. “Where is everything?” she asked, gazing at the endless expanse of cornfields that stretched as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she wouldn't believe the vastness of this open landscape.  She came from a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, her world confined to brick and mortar.  This was a whole new world for her.  \n\nOverwhelmed by the sea of corn stalks, I began to tell her about my childhood in rural Ohio, sharing stories of lazy summer days and the smell of fresh-cut hay in the air. In that moment, she finally understood where I came from, the roots that ran deep within this land.\n\nWe continued down the two-lane road, passing a quarry filled with crystal-clear water. Just past it, nestled amongst the trees, was my little development. The houses were mostly brick and stucco, each one boasting at least half an acre of land, meticulously cared for by their proud owners. Spring bursts with color as vibrant flowers bloom alongside the majestic trees that transform with every season.  And the driveways?  They were lined with gleaming Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, polished to perfection after a good old-fashioned car wash.\n\nAs we drove closer to my home, a friendly face always greeted us from the yard of our Korean neighbor. He spent his days meticulously mowing his lawn, a contented hum accompanying his work.  We all chuckled at his dedication, but his heart was always open and genuine.  He had a history filled with stories, a past life as a doctor that now mingled with the murmur of his John Deere Zero Turn mower.  He'd lost some of his youthful spark with age, but his spirit remained. \n\nFinally, we arrived at my grey stucco house.  Geese honked in the side yard, chased playfully by our energetic Terrier.  Behind the house, a small stream gurgled, feeding into the quarry, its music punctuated by the croaking of bullfrogs and the occasional moo from a nearby farm.  A hand-crafted wooden bridge led to a peaceful haven, untouched and alive with the whisper of trees, herbs, and wildflowers.  This was my childhood sanctuary, filled with the echoes of laughter and adventure.\n\nFrom building towering tree forts to \"hunting\" imaginary prey,  there was always something to do. And there were always friends to share it with. \n\nWinters in our small town were harsh, but breathtakingly beautiful.  The vibrant green transformed into a stark, empty wilderness.  The trees, once adorned with pink, purple, and orange flowers, stood bare, their branches skeletal against the winter sky. But when blessed with snow, a magical wonderland appeared overnight.  My sister and I would create snow angels and snowmen, our laughter echoing through the quiet air.  Sometimes, our winter days were filled with snowball fights, our arsenal of branches transformed into makeshift weapons. We would build massive fortresses of snow, our own icy kingdoms where imaginary worlds came to life. In that snowy realm, we were just kids, lost in a world of boundless imagination and carefree joy.",
            "My dear, you gotta understand about Portland, Oregon. It's a city that lives by its own rules, its own vibe.  The motto, painted on the side of a building that somehow manages to be a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and, let's just say, a place where the law bends a little, is \"Keep Portland Weird.\"  Some folks say it's a reminder of the old Portland, the one from the 90s and early 2000s, a hidden gem, less flashy and more affordable, where unique subcultures blossomed. Others see it as an invitation - come experience Portland, where being different isn't just tolerated, it's celebrated.  \n\nEven with all the fancy Californians moving in and the cranes constantly building new condos, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.  \"Weird\" doesn't mean everyone's always cool with everything, but it means being open to things that might make other cities raise an eyebrow. It doesn't mean we don't have our share of Starbucks and shopping malls, just that we don't take ourselves too seriously.\n\nLike, in my neighborhood, we've got houses painted in every color imaginable, gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets. And in the summer, there are these magical things called \"free boxes\" – cardboard boxes, sometimes plastic ones too, filled with someone's discarded treasures. You never know what you'll find: clothes, books, maybe even a vintage record player. It's like a treasure hunt, and it's all part of the Portland charm.\n\nThat's what Portland means to me, anyway. Just one version of \"weird\" among thousands. Some of my neighbors wouldn't dream of rummaging through a free box, they'd rather be at goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or cheering for the Timbers (our soccer team).  \n\nPortland is a city full of dreamers, people who chase their passions, even if it means spending a little too much time at the bar. Sure, we have our issues, like drug addiction and homelessness, which are, let's be honest, problems everywhere. We try to help, but it's a constant struggle.\n\nBut even with our flaws, Portland is a city that embraces its quirks, its complexities.  We're a community of artists, dreamers, and everyday people trying to make sense of the world. And in that sense, maybe \"weird\" is just another word for being human.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, standing strong in the north, watching the sun rise and set every day.  No matter how busy I get, how caught up in work and life, they're always there, solid and steady, unfazed by all the ups and downs. On those days when I'm feeling really stressed and overwhelmed, they seem to call to me. When I look at them, my worries seem to melt away, and I find a strength to keep going, one step at a time.\n\nI first fell in love with them back when I started university. The mountains north of campus were the first thing that truly captivated me. Sure, the university itself is beautiful, with its buildings, ponds, and trees,  but those mountains, they have a special place in my heart. \n\nThe town itself is charming, with its cozy cafes, perfect for those late-night study sessions fueled by caffeine. If you walk or take the bus a little further, you'll find the downtown area, filled with old buildings and a sense of history. It's like a little slice of a bustling city right in the heart of suburbia. But just a few blocks away, you can escape back to the peace and quiet of the small town, passing by the library as you go. This mix of energy and tranquility is what makes this place so special, like it's inviting you to explore.\n\nThere's a memory for every corner of this town. Whether it's walking past the old swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or racing through the downtown streets to catch a movie at the fancy theater (thanks to those free tickets from the university!). But, like any place, it holds its share of sad memories too. The ponds, in particular, have seen their fair share of tears shed during late-night existential crises.  (I've had a few of those!) Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each with a purpose, makes you wonder about your own place in the world.\n\n\nSo, I'd walk past the pond, past the park, past the houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I reached the main street. The sun was shining, painting the sky with vibrant colors as it rose above the palm trees. And as I looked up, I realized I was walking north.\n\nThere they were, just as they always had been. Those mighty mountains, towering over everything else, meeting the hazy blue and yellow sky. They seemed to say to me, without a word, \"Keep going. You've got this.\"",
            "Visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, won't leave you feeling lost! Its got that classic New York City vibe, with easy access to public transportation, which, let's be honest, is the lifeblood of the city. You'll be surrounded by the energy of the city, but with a distinct Asian flair. Over the past few years, Bensonhurst has become like a melting pot of cultures, with a whole bunch of Asian folks setting up shop. It's like one giant Asian block party, with supermarkets and laundromats popping up on practically every street corner.  \n\nAnd let me tell you, these Asian-owned businesses are the real deal! The supermarkets have the freshest ingredients at amazing prices, and the laundromats are super convenient. I can practically walk to four of them in just a couple of minutes - talk about grocery run easy! \n\nBut Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave, you know. It's a real mix of cultures, with immigrants and their kids making it their home. It's a melting pot of experiences.  \n\nThere's also a pretty sweet park nearby, all decked out with basketball courts, a soccer field, handball courts, swings, a playground - the whole shebang. It's like a mini city park, perfect for some outdoor fun. \n\nNow, there aren't any towering office buildings here. You'll mostly find apartment buildings and some cozy two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, but they're definitely loud!  \n\nJust be prepared for some engine revving and music blasting as you go about your day. And if you're out late at night, keep your wits about you. Bensonhurst is pretty safe, but like any city, there are a few unsavory characters lurking around.  I've had my share of run-ins with bullies in the past, and package theft is a bit of a problem.\n\nAnd hey, even though New York City has rules about cleaning up after your dog, some people just don't play by them. So watch your step, ya know? Dog waste is a bit of an epidemic here!",
            "Hmm...my neighborhood...it's like everything's on a slant.  Our house sits right at the top of the steepest hill, the one everyone calls \"the workout hill\" because all the runners use it.  It's funny, there aren't any sidewalks, so everyone, even cars, have to share the road.  It gets a bit bumpy and scary sometimes.  The wires hanging around are a mess, all tangled and patched up from that constant rain we get.  The big trees are everywhere, but people here don't like them much. They want to chop them down because they block the view of the ocean.  That's why all the houses are built up so high, like giant eyes peering out at the water.  It's beautiful at sunset, though, when the water glows and the sky turns orange.  But it's mostly cloudy here, so you see the sun through a veil of mist.  Everything gets damp and mossy, even cars!  Once, I left my car parked for a month and it turned green and fuzzy.  It took forever to scrape it all off.\n\nThere aren't many kids around. There's a school nearby, but mostly it's older folks, retired folks, living here.  Instead of children, everyone has dogs.  They're everywhere, lounging in yards or chasing each other down the street.  I had one sneak into my living room once!  We also have rabbits, big ones, that gardeners hate because they dig up everything.  My cats love to hunt them, though.  Oh, and we have birds, little sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes even hawks or eagles, until the crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops close by, but if you walk down to the water, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood.  The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks are fun to throw in the water.  The bay is small, you can see the other side even on foggy days.",
            "Life in our little corner of Tennessee is kinda like a slow, sweet song. You know, the kind that makes you feel all cozy and right at home.  We live on a street that links two big roads, so there's more traffic than I'd like, but it's a quiet neighborhood for the most part. Folks mostly keep to themselves, fussing over their yards or doing their daily chores. It's like a big family, everyone knows everyone.  We're at the front corner, so we see all the comings and goings. We know whose car is who's, and if something new rolls by, well, we notice. Some neighbors like to stroll around, maybe with their pups, and the kids are always whizzing by on their bikes. \n\nWe work from home, me and my wife, and our two girls, eleven and fourteen, are always on the go too.  So, yeah, everyone's used to us being around. We're always outside, even when it's drizzling. There's something about the smell of a barbecue on a sunny afternoon that makes everything just right. And you can bet your bottom dollar there's always a lawnmower going, especially from spring to fall.  We've got a bunch of trees around here, so there's plenty of shade, but come autumn, those leaves gotta go! We rake 'em up and burn 'em. I gotta admit, I kinda love that smell, it means fall is here.\n\nWe don't see much of a winter these days, so it's just a long stretch of fall, kind of like a never-ending autumn. Our garage is at the back, so the front door stays mostly closed, unless someone's knocking. I like tinkering in the garage with my truck and other projects, and when those doors are open, it feels like I'm closer to the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving, when all the families are gathering and cars are parked everywhere. Christmas and Mother's Day are the same way. But overall, I wouldn't trade this place for the world. If it wasn't for the traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood, man, it's like smack dab in the middle of nowhere.  Dirt, dirt, and more dirt, as far as the eye can see. You wouldn't believe it unless you lived here. It's like everyone else is living in a green paradise, with those manicured lawns that cost a fortune.  \n\nBack in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were spread out like nobody's business. Now it's kinda the same, but there's a ton more places popping up.  It's getting more and more like a city every day, which is kinda sad, you know?  I guess everywhere is changing like that.  The people are mostly friendly, but like any place, you have your good and bad.  I'm surrounded by these really cool old folks, so it's a pretty nice neighborhood.\n\nThe stores here?  Mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final.  If you want something fancy, you gotta drive a ways.  There's no Whole Foods or anything like that.  I think most people here work in construction.  Makes sense, right?  This place is still growing like crazy, so there's tons of building going on.  It freaks me out a little, though. I like things the way they are. I moved away from a big city, and I'm not going back, no way. \n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living.  Drywall and T-bar installation.  \n\nWhat I love most about living here is the animals. People come to the high desert for all kinds of reasons, but the unique wildlife is a big draw.  The desert is a tough place to live, and the animals that make it their home are tough too. It's important for us to learn about them and share this space with them. My kids are obsessed with lizards and bugs.  They're out there right now trying to catch 'em all! \n\nAs for things to do, we've got a few attractions. Victorville is a great place for families, it's a different kind of vacation. If you come here, try to catch the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast! And if you want to see snow, head up to Wrightwood for some winter sports. \n\nIf you're into history and nature, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-see. They've got fossils, Native American artifacts, and stuff about how Victorville grew up.",
            "Hmm, my neighborhood? Well, it's a bit different from what most people might picture. You see, instead of houses and yards, my neighborhood is the college campus I call home. My roommates and fellow dorm dwellers are my community, and the surrounding campus, my extended neighborhood, even if it's not as close-knit.  Even though it's unique, my neighborhood shares similarities with those traditional ones. We've got \"houses\" of sorts, folks, shops, and even a park, just like any other place. Let me tell you about these \"houses.\"  There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dorm rooms. In the apartments, you'll find a few people sharing each room, with a handful of rooms on each floor.  The buildings are usually two stories tall, meaning about 20 people live in each one. Then there are the actual houses, available for rent to anyone connected to the school. These are usually 2-4 bedroom places, mostly occupied by alumni. But there aren't many of these scattered around. Lastly, we have the dorm rooms, the most common type of housing here. Hundreds of students live in these, with two people sharing each room, with a few exceptions.  My school is a melting pot of cultures and ages, and that's reflected in my neighborhood. The staff members mostly live in the houses, while newer students stay in the dorms and the older ones in the apartments. Describing everyone here would be impossible, so let's move on to the shops and park. Being self-contained, our campus has plenty of stores and a single park.  We've got all the usual dining options you'd find in any neighborhood, plus the school's own unique clothing and grocery stores. You can find anything you need right here! And the park? It's a place for everyone to enjoy, always clean and safe thanks to the watchful eyes of our diverse community.",
            "Hmm...ten years have flown by since I landed here in this neighborhood.  Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I gotta admit, a few tears were shed. Saying goodbye to my old life, my friends, my roots, it was tough, you know? But my parents, they always wanted the best for me and my little sis.  A better place to live, a better school, a \"fancier\" neighborhood, as they put it.  At first, it was a big adjustment. Making new friends, facing new faces, some even turned into rivals. But hey, that's life, right?\n\nThe only neighbors who really felt like family were Mr. Glen and his kids, and for a while, Dennis too, since he lived right next door. They were always so welcoming, always up for a good time. I'll never forget Mr. Glen's wedding to Ms. Veda.  It was a blast! Dancing the night away, catching the little white strap she threw (didn't get the flowers though, ah well!),  and just enjoying the company. Marsharii, one of their daughters, we really hit it off that night. Wish I could catch up with her sometime.\n\nThis neighborhood can be like a maze, but these days I have a GPS, so I'm starting to explore more.  Mostly, I stick to familiar paths, like the ones I used to walk with Kason and Curtis. We were all about those video games back in the day, living life to the fullest, you know?  \n\nSometimes, I'd escape to the park, just to soak in the peace and quiet. It's like a pressure valve for me, a way to clear my head and find some inner calm. I even practice my balance with some sticks I bought from Home Depot, and sometimes I bring my bokken wooden sword for some extra fun.  \n\nThere's a basketball court and a tennis court too, though I haven't touched a tennis racket or a basketball in ages. Still, it's nice to know they're there if I ever feel like dusting them off. My dad and his friend Mr. Graves were big tennis fans, they really pushed me and my best friend to play.  Those were good times, tough but fun.\n\nSo yeah, this neighborhood has been good to me.  There are so many memories, so many stories.  I've had my ups and downs, but the best is yet to come, I know it!",
            "Hmm...my neighborhood, it's kinda like a mixed bag, you know? It's close to my college, which is a big plus, gotta love that convenience.  Mostly apartments, yeah, like a whole block of 'em. There are a few restaurants and bars, nothing fancy, but fun enough for a night out. One bar just got a makeover, but it got a bit pricier,  still not bad though. The crowd there is mostly college kids or folks who, well, let's just say they're not rolling in dough.  It's kinda like a melting pot, you know?  There are tons of kids around because there's this elementary school just a stone's throw away.\n\nI don't really know my neighbors, and honestly, I'm kinda cool with that.  They're a bit...enthusiastic about their weed-smoking, so the building management put this air freshener thing right outside their door. It's like, 'Hey, we know you're in there, but we're gonna try to mask the smell!' It's kinda funny, in a sad way. \n\nThe buildings around here are a bit old school, but some of them have gotten a facelift inside, which is nice.  Down the street, there are these brand new apartments that popped up, but they're a total scam. They look shiny and new on the outside, but the construction is shoddy. They're charging a fortune for a place that's barely worth half the rent, but hey, they're near campus, so they can get away with it, right?\n\nThere's this hole-in-the-wall restaurant around the corner that serves food on paper plates.  Most of it's microwaved, but it's cheap, so you can't really complain. And right next to that is a gas station, which, from what I hear, is a terrible place to work. But hey, they fixed up the road last summer with some city money, so now there's a nice sidewalk, grassy patches, and it's all spruced up.\n\nMy building is kind of hidden away under a canopy of trees. They chopped down a few of them, leaving these stumps, but there are way more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments.  My street is 42nd, but right behind me is 43rd, and that one's a bit rougher.  \n\nThe sidewalks are crumbling, and most of the buildings look like they're about to fall apart.  They've got a lot of trees there too, probably to hide the state of things. Most of the crime in the area seems to be around that apartment complex, but hey, I can't judge them alone. There are some buildings across the street from me with a pretty high turnover rate and a whole lot of trouble.\n\nBut you know what? I kinda like it here. It's affordable, and I've got all the essentials within reach.  I especially love being able to walk to school and having bus stops right outside my door for trips to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is like a little slice of simpler times.  It's full of these cute duplexes, spaced out so they look like little individual houses.  They're all painted yellow with white porches and those shiny green roofs, like something out of a storybook.  Most of the folks here know each other, and you'll often find us hanging out at the end of the driveways, chatting while the kids run around playing. It's so nice to have this kind of connection, especially in a world that feels so fast-paced and digital all the time.  It's like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees, with the blue sky and those fluffy white clouds. \n\nOf course, living in the South has its quirks.  This season, we've been dealing with some scary tornado warnings. Last night, we actually heard the sirens go off, so we all scrambled for shelter.  Me? I ended up in the bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and a couple of pillows for comfort. My big guy wasn't too keen on the bathroom idea and stayed in the living room, pacing and barking nervously.   \n\nThe whole neighborhood went quiet except for the sound of big hailstones crashing down. After the storm passed, the road looked like it was steaming from the sudden temperature change. It went from a sweltering 92 degrees to a more bearable 75 in just minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement instantly.  As the clouds cleared, the sun came out and it started to rain again. But this wasn't just any rain...a double rainbow appeared!  I ran inside, grabbed my camera, and snapped a few pictures to share with my friends and family on Facebook. They were amazed, just like me.  It was magical.\n\nThe neighborhood was quiet for another hour or so until folks started trickling back home, shaken but safe. Then it was back to normal - moms and kids outside, dinner cooking on the stove. I love this friendly neighborhood. It's been a welcome change after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I especially love the way folks talk down here, with their warm Southern accents.\n\nI live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, just like everyone else.  While the outside looks the same, the insides are all different. Some are pretty tiny, which seems weird to me. \n\nI love to walk over to the big field behind my apartment and head down to the pond.  I've seen deer there, and in the morning, you can hear this huge bullfrog singing his heart out. It's a beautiful place to live, just a hop, skip, and a jump from Charlotte. Every morning starts with the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It feels like we live in our own little village, with everyone looking out for each other. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm who brays in the evening, reminding us he's there. I feel so lucky to have found this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "Hmm...moving to this new place was like starting eighth grade all over again.  Making friends felt like a million miles away at first. But then, something magical happened.  Two familiar faces popped up, one just two houses down, the other right on my street.  We were close, thick as thieves, but life, as it does, took them away.  They're gone now, but the memories, they're still here, like little whispers in the wind.  Most of the folks who were here when I first moved in are still around, like old friends, always waving hello. \n\nThis neighborhood, it's like any other, you know?  Two-story houses lined up neat and tidy. On warm days, the sound of kids laughing and playing drifts through the air, making it feel like a big, happy family.  It's quiet most days, everyone minding their own business, but always there if you need them.  I've never had a problem with anyone here, not even a single frown.  It's a safe place, a haven.  I've ordered countless things online, packages piling up on my porch, and not a single one has ever gone missing.  There's a trust here, a sense of community that's hard to find these days. \n\nJust a hop, skip, and a jump from my door is a little park, a place where so many memories have been made.  Basketball games, football throws, baseball swings...I remember it all so clearly, the smell of freshly cut grass, the sound of laughter.  There was a time when I got elbowed right in the nose during a football game, a memory that still stings a little.  But those good times, the ones with scraped knees and muddy faces, they far outweigh the bad. Now, whenever I go to the park, it's to watch my cousin's little ones squeal with delight as they zoom down the slides and climb the monkey bars.  Seeing them there, it fills me with a warmth that spreads through my whole heart.  It's a trip down memory lane, a reminder of simpler times.  \n\nThis neighborhood, it's a melting pot of cultures, a symphony of flavors.  You can find anything you crave, just steps away.  Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian...all within a stone's throw.  These days, everyone's glued to their phones, ordering everything through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food reigns supreme, but you can find it everywhere, like a constant companion.  And pizza?  Oh, pizza is a religion here.  There are a dozen places within a mile radius, all vying for your taste buds.  \n\nWe have everything we need right here.  Dry cleaners, pharmacies, grocery stores...it's like a mini city.  There's even a little Indian store, tucked away like a treasure, where you can find spices and ingredients to cook up a storm.  It's a neighborhood where I feel truly at home.  Seeing the stories on social media, hearing the news about people's struggles with their neighbors, it makes me grateful for the peace and safety I have here.",
            "My hometown, Johnston, is just a little speck on the map of South Carolina.  It ain't fancy, but it's got a heart of gold, especially when it comes to those juicy peaches! Everyone around here knows Johnston as the Peach Capital of the World – you can even see it on the welcome sign as you drive in.  The landscape is mostly fields, either bursting with peaches or grazing cows.  \n\nThe houses scattered around town are mostly two stories high, with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or those classic gray shingles. You won't see them right on the road, though. They're tucked back a ways, leaving plenty of space for animals and crops out front. \n\nThe heart of town is where you'll find the only stoplight in the whole place, right at the four-way intersection. That's where all the stores are, too – not a whole lot, but enough to get by.  You've got Hong Kong, a tiny Chinese place run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant for a taste of south-of-the-border, and Gary's, a small burger joint.  There used to be a pizza place, but it closed up shop a while back. For your medicine needs, there's Maxwell and Halford Drug, a real old-fashioned pharmacy.  They're famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola, which is a local legend!\n\nThe grocery store is called Independent Grocers Alliance, but everyone just calls it IGA. It's small and a bit pricey, so most folks head over to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their big shopping trips. \n\nBut let me tell you, the real heart of Johnston is Dollar General. It's always bustling with people picking up everyday essentials. And then there's Possibilities Furniture & More, a sweet little furniture store run by a lovely woman who knows everyone in town. They even have movers to help you get your new couch up the stairs!  Right next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where they take care of your furry friends with everything from grooming to boarding. \n\nThe doctor's office and the vet are a little ways out from the main drag, but they're both good folks who take care of the town's health. And for the little ones, there's Johnston Elementary School.  After fifth grade, though, they have to head over to the next town for middle and high school.\n\nWe don't have any fancy parks or playgrounds, but we're working on a new recreational area. It'll be nice to have a place for families to gather and for folks to come and visit. \n\nLife in Johnston is pretty laid-back. There aren't a lot of things to do, no movie theaters or bowling alleys or anything like that. But it's a good place to live. It's small enough that you feel like everyone knows you, and it's got a real sense of community.",
            "My first glimpse into this neighborhood came from a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit of a shock, to be honest. Most apartments around here were going for over a thousand dollars a month, and I'd never heard a whisper about any missing folks. Maybe it's just the struggle we all face. I know a few friends who cry themselves to sleep at night.  Living costs are high, but we've learned to be resourceful, you know? We find beauty in the dusty charm of flea market treasures and those old mothballed clothes. You learn to smell less grown-up stuff, maybe you pick up a smoke habit, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But that flea market smell, it always sticks with you. It's like the scent of adulthood – dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, clinging to the leather even after you wash it.\n\nWe're lucky here, three thrift stores within walking distance. You can start on one end and hit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curiosity shop, all in a row. Downtown's a different story, bustling with cars and people every morning, but it's a different world inside those thrift stores. No matter how much traffic passes by, it's quiet in there. A perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon.\n\nEvery year, things seem to get a little crazier. More cars, more people flooding the streets. They call it a developing city, I guess. With a giant online empire for shopping and deliveries setting up shop here, it's going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York, everyone focused on their own goals, not really asking much from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and no one bats an eye. It's different from the South, where a little bit of concern means you really care. Here, people mind their own business. You can keep your walls up as long as you like, and the city just rolls on, like waves on the beach.\n\nIt's a lively place, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. We might not have a traditional apartment building full of strangers, but we're more like a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, lend a hand when we can. I feel lucky to be here. I get along with most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to be considerate, clean up after myself, leave them some food, and they do the same for me. We bring each other letters and packages. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs.\n\nI live in a huge, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "Hmm... living here is like stepping into one of those picture-perfect cookie cutter suburbs you see in the movies. You know, the kind where everyone's house looks exactly the same? Yeah, that's pretty much my neighborhood. The homeowner's association, bless their hearts, makes sure everything is spotless.  Every house is a single-family home, all with manicured lawns, little patches of decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Every once in a while, you'll see a small tree trying to add some character, but for the most part, it's all very uniform.  And speaking of uniform, everyone has a two-car garage.  Even the roads are all newly paved and spotless.  You won't find any potholes or cracks here, which is a nice change of pace.\n\nMost of the houses are single-story, but you'll see a few two-story ones sprinkled in.  Oh, and forget about those cute little mailboxes in front of each house.  We've got a giant, apartment-style mailbox cluster at the end of the street. You need a key to access your own box, just like in an apartment complex.  Think of it as the HOA's way of keeping things looking neat and tidy. \n\nMy house is right on the edge of the city, so it's kind of a mix between rural and suburban.  We've got a ton of land, which is great because we have multiple community pools that everyone can use. They're always well-kept and have those fancy gates, like a private resort. And there are loads of walking trails for those who like to stroll or take their dogs for a walk. You don't even need to go to a park!  You can just walk or run around the neighborhood and get your exercise in. \n\nMost of the people here are retired, which makes for a really peaceful atmosphere. It's super safe, and everyone looks out for each other. There are a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in, but for the most part, it's a quiet and friendly neighborhood.\n\nThe city itself is surprisingly big, even though it has this small-town vibe. We've got all the basics: a single mall (it's not huge, but it does the job!), a few different grocery stores (from fancy organic ones to bargain outlets), and all the other essentials you'd expect.  It's about a 15-minute drive to get to anything major, but once you're there, you've got plenty of options. \n\nOverall, my neighborhood is pretty typical, safe, well-maintained, and has a lot of nice things like pools and walking trails.  It's not exactly exciting, but it's comfortable and convenient.",
            "My town is like a little world tucked away from the big city, not too far but still its own thing.  It feels like that old saying, \"small town, big heart.\"  My part of town, on the east side, isn't fancy. The houses aren't worth much, and most folks here are just trying to make ends meet. But you know what? It's not a bad place. People are always smiling and saying hello when I walk by. Sure, there's been a few bumps in the road, like a couple of shootings and even a murder a few blocks over. It's sad, especially when  our neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting.  That's the thing about small towns, everything feels closer, you know? \n\n\nWe've been lucky, though. Nothing too bad has happened to us directly, just the usual stuff like someone taking our stuff off the porch if we forget to bring it in.\n\nBut the whole town has been hit hard by this whole drug thing, the opioid epidemic. It's taken so many good people. But there are people who care, there are places here that help folks get better, and people are trying to make things right.\n\nThe good news is, the school my son goes to is amazing. The teachers, the principal, everyone there is so good, they make you feel like your kid is the only one that matters. My son is a little different, but he's never felt picked on, never felt like he didn't belong. They really do take care of everyone there. \n\nAnd the best part? The school feeds every kid breakfast and lunch for free. They don't want anyone going hungry. It's a big deal because a lot of families here struggle to make ends meet. \n\nThe town itself is working hard to be better too. They've fixed up the roads, planted flowers, and made the parks nicer. It's just that most of that work has been done on the other side of town, where all the stores and stuff are.  We get a little left out over here on the east side.\n\nBut you know what?  We have our own things here too. We have a tight-knit community, good people, and a place that feels like home.  \n\nIt's not perfect, but we love it here. We've been here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine going anywhere else.",
            "My neighbourhood, it's a tapestry woven with stories.  It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of times gone by. My home is a seven-story apartment building, right across from the old live theater, a place where the ghosts of forgotten performances still linger. Just down the hill, there's this small arcade bar, a haven for all sorts of folks, especially on warm summer nights.  Lines form, stretching down the block, especially in June and July, as if the warmth draws them in like moths to a flame. A few blocks up, there's the city park, a green oasis in the heart of it all. It's bigger than you'd expect for this part of town, encircled by concrete with grand, sweeping stairs carved into its walls.\n\nWhen winter's icy grip tightens its hold, the park becomes a temporary home for those who have nowhere else to go.  They set up their tents in neat rows, huddled together for warmth against the biting winds and relentless rain.  It's not snow that chills them, but the lack of shelter.  Being together, in the heart of the city, keeps them a little warmer, a little safer. They're also within reach of the nearest family center, a beacon of hope where they can find a hot shower and a moment of respite.\n\nBut what truly makes my neighborhood special, what binds us together, isn't the history etched into the buildings or the charming architecture that spills down the rolling hills towards the ocean. It's the people, their stories, their resilience. Hilltop, you see, once wore a darker crown, notorious for gang violence that echoed through its streets.  The memories linger, whispered tales passed down through generations, stories of federal crackdowns and the DEA's relentless pursuit.  The people remember, though they've worked hard, even in the shadow of that past, to clean up the streets, to reclaim their neighborhood.  They still care, fiercely, about what happens in their corner of the world. \n\nThey say, with a hint of caution, that if you're white, you shouldn't walk alone at night. A relic of the past, perhaps, a reminder of a time when fear ruled, when assumptions were made, and prejudice cast its long shadow. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees something in me, a kindred spirit who recognizes the deep-seated scars of injustice.  We are both painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation, the echoes of racism, cultural conditioning, and fear disguised as ignorance.\n\nBut I know this: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. The pulse of the city beats strongest here, and I feel alive walking its streets, bathed in the warm glow of streetlights. I meet people who offer me a jacket before I can even ask, who see beyond the surface and offer a genuine connection. It's a place where the laundromat owner stays open a little later so I can charge my phone in the pouring rain, and where someone stops and hands me five dollars, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable on the bleakest of nights.  This is where I belong.",
            "My life is a slice of Americana, right here in small-town Michigan. It's like stepping back in time, with rolling farmland giving way to quaint tourist spots. Forget those big city chains - no bustling malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee's in sight!  You gotta hop in the car to get to anything, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.  You see, I live surrounded by the kind of beauty that takes your breath away. \n\nMy little town sits nestled between two shimmering lakes - Lake Michigan on one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other.  Beaches are practically on every corner, just begging for a dip. \n\nMy neighborhood? It's like stepping into a postcard of Middle America.  Houses aren't stacked on top of each other like in the city; they're unique, each with its own story to tell.  Some have been updated, some are vintage beauties, but they all have that cozy charm. Most have full basements peeking out from the ground, and the colors just paint a happy picture - every shade imaginable!  \n\nOut front, you'll find gardens bursting with life, playful trampolines bouncing with kids, and swings sets creaking with laughter. Some folks even have fences for their furry friends. \n\nThis is where hard-working families thrive. You see kids zipping around on bikes, dogs getting their afternoon stroll, neighbors waving and chatting. Everyone knows everyone, and you can tell who belongs and who's just passing through. \n\nThe lawns are perfect, green and manicured, not a single fallen leaf out of place. It's not about fancy mansions, but about that feeling of home and belonging.\n\nIt's a quiet place, peaceful and safe - the kind of place where you can raise a family and build a life.  The Sheriff's department and jail are just down the road, keeping things safe, and the Health department is right next door.  The recycling center is always buzzing, and everyone uses it.   \n\nBaseball games echo through the air, with excited announcers calling out plays, and nearby, the small airport's planes take off and land, adding a touch of adventure to the everyday.  If you're craving ice cream, you can stroll a few blocks to the local shop, and if you're feeling adventurous, you can even bike downtown.  The park is just around the corner, perfect for a family picnic. \n\nIt may not be glamorous, but it's where my heart belongs. It's a special place, a haven where people feel safe and connected."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My city's like a melting pot, you know?  It's got these huge parts with tons of shops and businesses all mixed in with regular neighborhoods. There are all sorts of places to grab a bite or find something cool to buy, from big brand names to these cute little shops that pop up everywhere. You can practically walk to them from your house, which is kind of nice.  And there are parks sprinkled around, perfect for families with kids. \n\nThe coolest thing is how different everyone is! We've got a whole area with a big LGBTQ+ community, a group of Orthodox Jews, and a bunch of folks who came over from the former Soviet Union. Then, just a little further out, you've got all these other nationalities living in their own little neighborhoods: Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more. It's crazy how close they all are, but traffic makes it feel like a million miles away sometimes.\n\nI mean, driving just ten miles can take forever, especially during rush hour.  Most people just stay in their cars, though.  No one really walks around here, so it's no surprise that we've got some of the worst traffic in the world. Finding a parking spot is a nightmare! Plus, they keep building tons of new apartment buildings, so it seems like the city is just getting bigger and busier.\n\nBut hey, not everyone wants to live in a huge apartment building. There are still houses, all shapes and sizes, and smaller apartment complexes scattered around. Some have single-family homes, some have duplexes. My neighborhood is a mix of everything, and the people are all ages.  Honestly, I don't know most of my neighbors.  It's not like the old days when I'd play outside with the kids from down the street all the time.  It's not quite as tight-knit anymore.",
            "My neighborhood, it's a place where stories unfold. Mostly, you see those classic single-family houses, but a few have been split in two, like twins sharing a hug. My place has a little patch of grass out front and a tiny driveway, kinda like everyone else's. It's a remnant of a time when living in the suburbs was the big dream, you know? Like, it felt like everyone was reaching for it. But now, it's like that dream's fading a little. Still, my neighborhood, and others like it, hold onto that feeling, whispering that the dream is still out there.  \n\nThe folks aren't as bright-eyed as they used to be, and the lawns aren't as perfect. But there's always a car or two in the driveways, and the kids, they play like the whole world is right there in front of them. The old school, almost 90 years young, still stands tall, promising a future to the young ones and bringing back memories for the older folks. The churches are scattered, mostly quiet, but the basketball courts, those are always buzzing.\n\nEvery house looks different, but they all feel the same, like old friends. There's a big supermarket called \"Super A,\" run by a big Yemeni family, probably the only ones around here. Most folks are African American, and the streets are wide enough for the kids to play football, stopping only to let the cars pass.  \n\nWe're a neighborhood of families, generations who've been here forever, with stories about when everyone knew everyone. There used to be a karate school, but when those karate kid movies went out of style, the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, because, well, sometimes you need a little something extra, right? There's also a tiny movie theater showing old films for a song. The young folks think it's too boring, but the older folks, they love it. A good night out without the kids, you know?\n\nWe've got this expressway cutting through town, but the entrance and exit are in the next town over. We tried to get our own exit once, the young folks were all for it, but the older folks said it would ruin the town. They talked the city council into saying no. Now they're building a new high school, and we're trying to pick a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be perfect, kinda like a symbol of who we are.",
            "Hmm, you might just whiff it the first time around, you know? It's tucked behind a shopping strip, not exactly the kind of place you'd picture as a buzzing community. But if you sneak past that old, forgotten Whole Foods and peek behind the hotels that only wake up for family reunions once in a while, you'll stumble upon a whole world you never knew existed. \n\nImagine this: there are these apartment complexes lining the road, like a bunch of Russian nesting dolls someone's taken apart and put back together in a row.  Now, the first ones you'll see have been in the news for some shady stuff, so let's not dwell on them. Appearances can be deceiving, right? But the ones next door, and the ones after that, they're a whole different story – a secret world unknown to most folks around here.\n\nJust across from those apartments, you'll find a quiet little community college campus. It's like a sleepy giant, with students shuffling in, yawning and clutching their coffee at 7 in the morning. The iron gates creak open like a sleepy sigh, letting them in one by one. Meanwhile, commuters are honking their horns and grumbling about the traffic. \n\nThe road then bumps into another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for folks who've had their share of accidents.  The center has rocking chairs on the porch and a ceiling fan that lazily whirls the hot summer air. \n\nKids are running around in the park, cartwheeling and giggling. Bees buzz around the flower patches by the road, and older folks walk their dogs, shaking their heads at the skateboarders and nodding politely at the teenage girls gossiping by the swings. \n\nThere's a sushi place in a nearby strip mall – cheap eats, but never too crowded. Right next door, there's a swimming supply store, and a nail salon tucked right in between.  You could practically get your pool ready, get a manicure, and grab some hibachi chicken all in one stop – the magic of a strip mall, right?  \n\nAnd don't forget the frozen yogurt place – the DIY kind – where teenagers are always hanging out, slurping down icy treats and pulling off skateboard tricks. They think they're so cool with their vapes, you know?\n\nThis neighborhood, it's like a snapshot of America. A piece of history frozen in time, where not much ever changes, not even time itself.",
            "Hmm...she looked around, her eyes wide with wonder. “Where is everything?” she asked, gazing at the endless expanse of cornfields that stretched as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she wouldn't believe the vastness of this open landscape.  She came from a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, her world confined to brick and mortar.  This was a whole new world for her.  \n\nOverwhelmed by the sea of corn stalks, I began to tell her about my childhood in rural Ohio, sharing stories of lazy summer days and the smell of fresh-cut hay in the air. In that moment, she finally understood where I came from, the roots that ran deep within this land.\n\nWe continued down the two-lane road, passing a quarry filled with crystal-clear water. Just past it, nestled amongst the trees, was my little development. The houses were mostly brick and stucco, each one boasting at least half an acre of land, meticulously cared for by their proud owners. Spring bursts with color as vibrant flowers bloom alongside the majestic trees that transform with every season.  And the driveways?  They were lined with gleaming Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, polished to perfection after a good old-fashioned car wash.\n\nAs we drove closer to my home, a friendly face always greeted us from the yard of our Korean neighbor. He spent his days meticulously mowing his lawn, a contented hum accompanying his work.  We all chuckled at his dedication, but his heart was always open and genuine.  He had a history filled with stories, a past life as a doctor that now mingled with the murmur of his John Deere Zero Turn mower.  He'd lost some of his youthful spark with age, but his spirit remained. \n\nFinally, we arrived at my grey stucco house.  Geese honked in the side yard, chased playfully by our energetic Terrier.  Behind the house, a small stream gurgled, feeding into the quarry, its music punctuated by the croaking of bullfrogs and the occasional moo from a nearby farm.  A hand-crafted wooden bridge led to a peaceful haven, untouched and alive with the whisper of trees, herbs, and wildflowers.  This was my childhood sanctuary, filled with the echoes of laughter and adventure.\n\nFrom building towering tree forts to \"hunting\" imaginary prey,  there was always something to do. And there were always friends to share it with. \n\nWinters in our small town were harsh, but breathtakingly beautiful.  The vibrant green transformed into a stark, empty wilderness.  The trees, once adorned with pink, purple, and orange flowers, stood bare, their branches skeletal against the winter sky. But when blessed with snow, a magical wonderland appeared overnight.  My sister and I would create snow angels and snowmen, our laughter echoing through the quiet air.  Sometimes, our winter days were filled with snowball fights, our arsenal of branches transformed into makeshift weapons. We would build massive fortresses of snow, our own icy kingdoms where imaginary worlds came to life. In that snowy realm, we were just kids, lost in a world of boundless imagination and carefree joy.",
            "My dear, you gotta understand about Portland, Oregon. It's a city that lives by its own rules, its own vibe.  The motto, painted on the side of a building that somehow manages to be a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and, let's just say, a place where the law bends a little, is \"Keep Portland Weird.\"  Some folks say it's a reminder of the old Portland, the one from the 90s and early 2000s, a hidden gem, less flashy and more affordable, where unique subcultures blossomed. Others see it as an invitation - come experience Portland, where being different isn't just tolerated, it's celebrated.  \n\nEven with all the fancy Californians moving in and the cranes constantly building new condos, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.  \"Weird\" doesn't mean everyone's always cool with everything, but it means being open to things that might make other cities raise an eyebrow. It doesn't mean we don't have our share of Starbucks and shopping malls, just that we don't take ourselves too seriously.\n\nLike, in my neighborhood, we've got houses painted in every color imaginable, gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets. And in the summer, there are these magical things called \"free boxes\" – cardboard boxes, sometimes plastic ones too, filled with someone's discarded treasures. You never know what you'll find: clothes, books, maybe even a vintage record player. It's like a treasure hunt, and it's all part of the Portland charm.\n\nThat's what Portland means to me, anyway. Just one version of \"weird\" among thousands. Some of my neighbors wouldn't dream of rummaging through a free box, they'd rather be at goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or cheering for the Timbers (our soccer team).  \n\nPortland is a city full of dreamers, people who chase their passions, even if it means spending a little too much time at the bar. Sure, we have our issues, like drug addiction and homelessness, which are, let's be honest, problems everywhere. We try to help, but it's a constant struggle.\n\nBut even with our flaws, Portland is a city that embraces its quirks, its complexities.  We're a community of artists, dreamers, and everyday people trying to make sense of the world. And in that sense, maybe \"weird\" is just another word for being human.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, standing strong in the north, watching the sun rise and set every day.  No matter how busy I get, how caught up in work and life, they're always there, solid and steady, unfazed by all the ups and downs. On those days when I'm feeling really stressed and overwhelmed, they seem to call to me. When I look at them, my worries seem to melt away, and I find a strength to keep going, one step at a time.\n\nI first fell in love with them back when I started university. The mountains north of campus were the first thing that truly captivated me. Sure, the university itself is beautiful, with its buildings, ponds, and trees,  but those mountains, they have a special place in my heart. \n\nThe town itself is charming, with its cozy cafes, perfect for those late-night study sessions fueled by caffeine. If you walk or take the bus a little further, you'll find the downtown area, filled with old buildings and a sense of history. It's like a little slice of a bustling city right in the heart of suburbia. But just a few blocks away, you can escape back to the peace and quiet of the small town, passing by the library as you go. This mix of energy and tranquility is what makes this place so special, like it's inviting you to explore.\n\nThere's a memory for every corner of this town. Whether it's walking past the old swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or racing through the downtown streets to catch a movie at the fancy theater (thanks to those free tickets from the university!). But, like any place, it holds its share of sad memories too. The ponds, in particular, have seen their fair share of tears shed during late-night existential crises.  (I've had a few of those!) Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each with a purpose, makes you wonder about your own place in the world.\n\n\nSo, I'd walk past the pond, past the park, past the houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I reached the main street. The sun was shining, painting the sky with vibrant colors as it rose above the palm trees. And as I looked up, I realized I was walking north.\n\nThere they were, just as they always had been. Those mighty mountains, towering over everything else, meeting the hazy blue and yellow sky. They seemed to say to me, without a word, \"Keep going. You've got this.\"",
            "Visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, won't leave you feeling lost! Its got that classic New York City vibe, with easy access to public transportation, which, let's be honest, is the lifeblood of the city. You'll be surrounded by the energy of the city, but with a distinct Asian flair. Over the past few years, Bensonhurst has become like a melting pot of cultures, with a whole bunch of Asian folks setting up shop. It's like one giant Asian block party, with supermarkets and laundromats popping up on practically every street corner.  \n\nAnd let me tell you, these Asian-owned businesses are the real deal! The supermarkets have the freshest ingredients at amazing prices, and the laundromats are super convenient. I can practically walk to four of them in just a couple of minutes - talk about grocery run easy! \n\nBut Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave, you know. It's a real mix of cultures, with immigrants and their kids making it their home. It's a melting pot of experiences.  \n\nThere's also a pretty sweet park nearby, all decked out with basketball courts, a soccer field, handball courts, swings, a playground - the whole shebang. It's like a mini city park, perfect for some outdoor fun. \n\nNow, there aren't any towering office buildings here. You'll mostly find apartment buildings and some cozy two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, but they're definitely loud!  \n\nJust be prepared for some engine revving and music blasting as you go about your day. And if you're out late at night, keep your wits about you. Bensonhurst is pretty safe, but like any city, there are a few unsavory characters lurking around.  I've had my share of run-ins with bullies in the past, and package theft is a bit of a problem.\n\nAnd hey, even though New York City has rules about cleaning up after your dog, some people just don't play by them. So watch your step, ya know? Dog waste is a bit of an epidemic here!",
            "Hmm...my neighborhood...it's like everything's on a slant.  Our house sits right at the top of the steepest hill, the one everyone calls \"the workout hill\" because all the runners use it.  It's funny, there aren't any sidewalks, so everyone, even cars, have to share the road.  It gets a bit bumpy and scary sometimes.  The wires hanging around are a mess, all tangled and patched up from that constant rain we get.  The big trees are everywhere, but people here don't like them much. They want to chop them down because they block the view of the ocean.  That's why all the houses are built up so high, like giant eyes peering out at the water.  It's beautiful at sunset, though, when the water glows and the sky turns orange.  But it's mostly cloudy here, so you see the sun through a veil of mist.  Everything gets damp and mossy, even cars!  Once, I left my car parked for a month and it turned green and fuzzy.  It took forever to scrape it all off.\n\nThere aren't many kids around. There's a school nearby, but mostly it's older folks, retired folks, living here.  Instead of children, everyone has dogs.  They're everywhere, lounging in yards or chasing each other down the street.  I had one sneak into my living room once!  We also have rabbits, big ones, that gardeners hate because they dig up everything.  My cats love to hunt them, though.  Oh, and we have birds, little sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes even hawks or eagles, until the crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops close by, but if you walk down to the water, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood.  The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks are fun to throw in the water.  The bay is small, you can see the other side even on foggy days.",
            "Life in our little corner of Tennessee is kinda like a slow, sweet song. You know, the kind that makes you feel all cozy and right at home.  We live on a street that links two big roads, so there's more traffic than I'd like, but it's a quiet neighborhood for the most part. Folks mostly keep to themselves, fussing over their yards or doing their daily chores. It's like a big family, everyone knows everyone.  We're at the front corner, so we see all the comings and goings. We know whose car is who's, and if something new rolls by, well, we notice. Some neighbors like to stroll around, maybe with their pups, and the kids are always whizzing by on their bikes. \n\nWe work from home, me and my wife, and our two girls, eleven and fourteen, are always on the go too.  So, yeah, everyone's used to us being around. We're always outside, even when it's drizzling. There's something about the smell of a barbecue on a sunny afternoon that makes everything just right. And you can bet your bottom dollar there's always a lawnmower going, especially from spring to fall.  We've got a bunch of trees around here, so there's plenty of shade, but come autumn, those leaves gotta go! We rake 'em up and burn 'em. I gotta admit, I kinda love that smell, it means fall is here.\n\nWe don't see much of a winter these days, so it's just a long stretch of fall, kind of like a never-ending autumn. Our garage is at the back, so the front door stays mostly closed, unless someone's knocking. I like tinkering in the garage with my truck and other projects, and when those doors are open, it feels like I'm closer to the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving, when all the families are gathering and cars are parked everywhere. Christmas and Mother's Day are the same way. But overall, I wouldn't trade this place for the world. If it wasn't for the traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood, man, it's like smack dab in the middle of nowhere.  Dirt, dirt, and more dirt, as far as the eye can see. You wouldn't believe it unless you lived here. It's like everyone else is living in a green paradise, with those manicured lawns that cost a fortune.  \n\nBack in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were spread out like nobody's business. Now it's kinda the same, but there's a ton more places popping up.  It's getting more and more like a city every day, which is kinda sad, you know?  I guess everywhere is changing like that.  The people are mostly friendly, but like any place, you have your good and bad.  I'm surrounded by these really cool old folks, so it's a pretty nice neighborhood.\n\nThe stores here?  Mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final.  If you want something fancy, you gotta drive a ways.  There's no Whole Foods or anything like that.  I think most people here work in construction.  Makes sense, right?  This place is still growing like crazy, so there's tons of building going on.  It freaks me out a little, though. I like things the way they are. I moved away from a big city, and I'm not going back, no way. \n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living.  Drywall and T-bar installation.  \n\nWhat I love most about living here is the animals. People come to the high desert for all kinds of reasons, but the unique wildlife is a big draw.  The desert is a tough place to live, and the animals that make it their home are tough too. It's important for us to learn about them and share this space with them. My kids are obsessed with lizards and bugs.  They're out there right now trying to catch 'em all! \n\nAs for things to do, we've got a few attractions. Victorville is a great place for families, it's a different kind of vacation. If you come here, try to catch the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast! And if you want to see snow, head up to Wrightwood for some winter sports. \n\nIf you're into history and nature, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-see. They've got fossils, Native American artifacts, and stuff about how Victorville grew up.",
            "Hmm, my neighborhood? Well, it's a bit different from what most people might picture. You see, instead of houses and yards, my neighborhood is the college campus I call home. My roommates and fellow dorm dwellers are my community, and the surrounding campus, my extended neighborhood, even if it's not as close-knit.  Even though it's unique, my neighborhood shares similarities with those traditional ones. We've got \"houses\" of sorts, folks, shops, and even a park, just like any other place. Let me tell you about these \"houses.\"  There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dorm rooms. In the apartments, you'll find a few people sharing each room, with a handful of rooms on each floor.  The buildings are usually two stories tall, meaning about 20 people live in each one. Then there are the actual houses, available for rent to anyone connected to the school. These are usually 2-4 bedroom places, mostly occupied by alumni. But there aren't many of these scattered around. Lastly, we have the dorm rooms, the most common type of housing here. Hundreds of students live in these, with two people sharing each room, with a few exceptions.  My school is a melting pot of cultures and ages, and that's reflected in my neighborhood. The staff members mostly live in the houses, while newer students stay in the dorms and the older ones in the apartments. Describing everyone here would be impossible, so let's move on to the shops and park. Being self-contained, our campus has plenty of stores and a single park.  We've got all the usual dining options you'd find in any neighborhood, plus the school's own unique clothing and grocery stores. You can find anything you need right here! And the park? It's a place for everyone to enjoy, always clean and safe thanks to the watchful eyes of our diverse community.",
            "Hmm...ten years have flown by since I landed here in this neighborhood.  Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I gotta admit, a few tears were shed. Saying goodbye to my old life, my friends, my roots, it was tough, you know? But my parents, they always wanted the best for me and my little sis.  A better place to live, a better school, a \"fancier\" neighborhood, as they put it.  At first, it was a big adjustment. Making new friends, facing new faces, some even turned into rivals. But hey, that's life, right?\n\nThe only neighbors who really felt like family were Mr. Glen and his kids, and for a while, Dennis too, since he lived right next door. They were always so welcoming, always up for a good time. I'll never forget Mr. Glen's wedding to Ms. Veda.  It was a blast! Dancing the night away, catching the little white strap she threw (didn't get the flowers though, ah well!),  and just enjoying the company. Marsharii, one of their daughters, we really hit it off that night. Wish I could catch up with her sometime.\n\nThis neighborhood can be like a maze, but these days I have a GPS, so I'm starting to explore more.  Mostly, I stick to familiar paths, like the ones I used to walk with Kason and Curtis. We were all about those video games back in the day, living life to the fullest, you know?  \n\nSometimes, I'd escape to the park, just to soak in the peace and quiet. It's like a pressure valve for me, a way to clear my head and find some inner calm. I even practice my balance with some sticks I bought from Home Depot, and sometimes I bring my bokken wooden sword for some extra fun.  \n\nThere's a basketball court and a tennis court too, though I haven't touched a tennis racket or a basketball in ages. Still, it's nice to know they're there if I ever feel like dusting them off. My dad and his friend Mr. Graves were big tennis fans, they really pushed me and my best friend to play.  Those were good times, tough but fun.\n\nSo yeah, this neighborhood has been good to me.  There are so many memories, so many stories.  I've had my ups and downs, but the best is yet to come, I know it!",
            "Hmm...my neighborhood, it's kinda like a mixed bag, you know? It's close to my college, which is a big plus, gotta love that convenience.  Mostly apartments, yeah, like a whole block of 'em. There are a few restaurants and bars, nothing fancy, but fun enough for a night out. One bar just got a makeover, but it got a bit pricier,  still not bad though. The crowd there is mostly college kids or folks who, well, let's just say they're not rolling in dough.  It's kinda like a melting pot, you know?  There are tons of kids around because there's this elementary school just a stone's throw away.\n\nI don't really know my neighbors, and honestly, I'm kinda cool with that.  They're a bit...enthusiastic about their weed-smoking, so the building management put this air freshener thing right outside their door. It's like, 'Hey, we know you're in there, but we're gonna try to mask the smell!' It's kinda funny, in a sad way. \n\nThe buildings around here are a bit old school, but some of them have gotten a facelift inside, which is nice.  Down the street, there are these brand new apartments that popped up, but they're a total scam. They look shiny and new on the outside, but the construction is shoddy. They're charging a fortune for a place that's barely worth half the rent, but hey, they're near campus, so they can get away with it, right?\n\nThere's this hole-in-the-wall restaurant around the corner that serves food on paper plates.  Most of it's microwaved, but it's cheap, so you can't really complain. And right next to that is a gas station, which, from what I hear, is a terrible place to work. But hey, they fixed up the road last summer with some city money, so now there's a nice sidewalk, grassy patches, and it's all spruced up.\n\nMy building is kind of hidden away under a canopy of trees. They chopped down a few of them, leaving these stumps, but there are way more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments.  My street is 42nd, but right behind me is 43rd, and that one's a bit rougher.  \n\nThe sidewalks are crumbling, and most of the buildings look like they're about to fall apart.  They've got a lot of trees there too, probably to hide the state of things. Most of the crime in the area seems to be around that apartment complex, but hey, I can't judge them alone. There are some buildings across the street from me with a pretty high turnover rate and a whole lot of trouble.\n\nBut you know what? I kinda like it here. It's affordable, and I've got all the essentials within reach.  I especially love being able to walk to school and having bus stops right outside my door for trips to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is like a little slice of simpler times.  It's full of these cute duplexes, spaced out so they look like little individual houses.  They're all painted yellow with white porches and those shiny green roofs, like something out of a storybook.  Most of the folks here know each other, and you'll often find us hanging out at the end of the driveways, chatting while the kids run around playing. It's so nice to have this kind of connection, especially in a world that feels so fast-paced and digital all the time.  It's like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees, with the blue sky and those fluffy white clouds. \n\nOf course, living in the South has its quirks.  This season, we've been dealing with some scary tornado warnings. Last night, we actually heard the sirens go off, so we all scrambled for shelter.  Me? I ended up in the bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and a couple of pillows for comfort. My big guy wasn't too keen on the bathroom idea and stayed in the living room, pacing and barking nervously.   \n\nThe whole neighborhood went quiet except for the sound of big hailstones crashing down. After the storm passed, the road looked like it was steaming from the sudden temperature change. It went from a sweltering 92 degrees to a more bearable 75 in just minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement instantly.  As the clouds cleared, the sun came out and it started to rain again. But this wasn't just any rain...a double rainbow appeared!  I ran inside, grabbed my camera, and snapped a few pictures to share with my friends and family on Facebook. They were amazed, just like me.  It was magical.\n\nThe neighborhood was quiet for another hour or so until folks started trickling back home, shaken but safe. Then it was back to normal - moms and kids outside, dinner cooking on the stove. I love this friendly neighborhood. It's been a welcome change after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I especially love the way folks talk down here, with their warm Southern accents.\n\nI live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, just like everyone else.  While the outside looks the same, the insides are all different. Some are pretty tiny, which seems weird to me. \n\nI love to walk over to the big field behind my apartment and head down to the pond.  I've seen deer there, and in the morning, you can hear this huge bullfrog singing his heart out. It's a beautiful place to live, just a hop, skip, and a jump from Charlotte. Every morning starts with the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It feels like we live in our own little village, with everyone looking out for each other. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm who brays in the evening, reminding us he's there. I feel so lucky to have found this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "Hmm...moving to this new place was like starting eighth grade all over again.  Making friends felt like a million miles away at first. But then, something magical happened.  Two familiar faces popped up, one just two houses down, the other right on my street.  We were close, thick as thieves, but life, as it does, took them away.  They're gone now, but the memories, they're still here, like little whispers in the wind.  Most of the folks who were here when I first moved in are still around, like old friends, always waving hello. \n\nThis neighborhood, it's like any other, you know?  Two-story houses lined up neat and tidy. On warm days, the sound of kids laughing and playing drifts through the air, making it feel like a big, happy family.  It's quiet most days, everyone minding their own business, but always there if you need them.  I've never had a problem with anyone here, not even a single frown.  It's a safe place, a haven.  I've ordered countless things online, packages piling up on my porch, and not a single one has ever gone missing.  There's a trust here, a sense of community that's hard to find these days. \n\nJust a hop, skip, and a jump from my door is a little park, a place where so many memories have been made.  Basketball games, football throws, baseball swings...I remember it all so clearly, the smell of freshly cut grass, the sound of laughter.  There was a time when I got elbowed right in the nose during a football game, a memory that still stings a little.  But those good times, the ones with scraped knees and muddy faces, they far outweigh the bad. Now, whenever I go to the park, it's to watch my cousin's little ones squeal with delight as they zoom down the slides and climb the monkey bars.  Seeing them there, it fills me with a warmth that spreads through my whole heart.  It's a trip down memory lane, a reminder of simpler times.  \n\nThis neighborhood, it's a melting pot of cultures, a symphony of flavors.  You can find anything you crave, just steps away.  Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian...all within a stone's throw.  These days, everyone's glued to their phones, ordering everything through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food reigns supreme, but you can find it everywhere, like a constant companion.  And pizza?  Oh, pizza is a religion here.  There are a dozen places within a mile radius, all vying for your taste buds.  \n\nWe have everything we need right here.  Dry cleaners, pharmacies, grocery stores...it's like a mini city.  There's even a little Indian store, tucked away like a treasure, where you can find spices and ingredients to cook up a storm.  It's a neighborhood where I feel truly at home.  Seeing the stories on social media, hearing the news about people's struggles with their neighbors, it makes me grateful for the peace and safety I have here.",
            "My hometown, Johnston, is just a little speck on the map of South Carolina.  It ain't fancy, but it's got a heart of gold, especially when it comes to those juicy peaches! Everyone around here knows Johnston as the Peach Capital of the World – you can even see it on the welcome sign as you drive in.  The landscape is mostly fields, either bursting with peaches or grazing cows.  \n\nThe houses scattered around town are mostly two stories high, with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or those classic gray shingles. You won't see them right on the road, though. They're tucked back a ways, leaving plenty of space for animals and crops out front. \n\nThe heart of town is where you'll find the only stoplight in the whole place, right at the four-way intersection. That's where all the stores are, too – not a whole lot, but enough to get by.  You've got Hong Kong, a tiny Chinese place run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant for a taste of south-of-the-border, and Gary's, a small burger joint.  There used to be a pizza place, but it closed up shop a while back. For your medicine needs, there's Maxwell and Halford Drug, a real old-fashioned pharmacy.  They're famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola, which is a local legend!\n\nThe grocery store is called Independent Grocers Alliance, but everyone just calls it IGA. It's small and a bit pricey, so most folks head over to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their big shopping trips. \n\nBut let me tell you, the real heart of Johnston is Dollar General. It's always bustling with people picking up everyday essentials. And then there's Possibilities Furniture & More, a sweet little furniture store run by a lovely woman who knows everyone in town. They even have movers to help you get your new couch up the stairs!  Right next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where they take care of your furry friends with everything from grooming to boarding. \n\nThe doctor's office and the vet are a little ways out from the main drag, but they're both good folks who take care of the town's health. And for the little ones, there's Johnston Elementary School.  After fifth grade, though, they have to head over to the next town for middle and high school.\n\nWe don't have any fancy parks or playgrounds, but we're working on a new recreational area. It'll be nice to have a place for families to gather and for folks to come and visit. \n\nLife in Johnston is pretty laid-back. There aren't a lot of things to do, no movie theaters or bowling alleys or anything like that. But it's a good place to live. It's small enough that you feel like everyone knows you, and it's got a real sense of community.",
            "My first glimpse into this neighborhood came from a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit of a shock, to be honest. Most apartments around here were going for over a thousand dollars a month, and I'd never heard a whisper about any missing folks. Maybe it's just the struggle we all face. I know a few friends who cry themselves to sleep at night.  Living costs are high, but we've learned to be resourceful, you know? We find beauty in the dusty charm of flea market treasures and those old mothballed clothes. You learn to smell less grown-up stuff, maybe you pick up a smoke habit, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But that flea market smell, it always sticks with you. It's like the scent of adulthood – dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, clinging to the leather even after you wash it.\n\nWe're lucky here, three thrift stores within walking distance. You can start on one end and hit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curiosity shop, all in a row. Downtown's a different story, bustling with cars and people every morning, but it's a different world inside those thrift stores. No matter how much traffic passes by, it's quiet in there. A perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon.\n\nEvery year, things seem to get a little crazier. More cars, more people flooding the streets. They call it a developing city, I guess. With a giant online empire for shopping and deliveries setting up shop here, it's going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York, everyone focused on their own goals, not really asking much from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and no one bats an eye. It's different from the South, where a little bit of concern means you really care. Here, people mind their own business. You can keep your walls up as long as you like, and the city just rolls on, like waves on the beach.\n\nIt's a lively place, though. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. We might not have a traditional apartment building full of strangers, but we're more like a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, lend a hand when we can. I feel lucky to be here. I get along with most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to be considerate, clean up after myself, leave them some food, and they do the same for me. We bring each other letters and packages. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs.\n\nI live in a huge, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "Hmm... living here is like stepping into one of those picture-perfect cookie cutter suburbs you see in the movies. You know, the kind where everyone's house looks exactly the same? Yeah, that's pretty much my neighborhood. The homeowner's association, bless their hearts, makes sure everything is spotless.  Every house is a single-family home, all with manicured lawns, little patches of decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Every once in a while, you'll see a small tree trying to add some character, but for the most part, it's all very uniform.  And speaking of uniform, everyone has a two-car garage.  Even the roads are all newly paved and spotless.  You won't find any potholes or cracks here, which is a nice change of pace.\n\nMost of the houses are single-story, but you'll see a few two-story ones sprinkled in.  Oh, and forget about those cute little mailboxes in front of each house.  We've got a giant, apartment-style mailbox cluster at the end of the street. You need a key to access your own box, just like in an apartment complex.  Think of it as the HOA's way of keeping things looking neat and tidy. \n\nMy house is right on the edge of the city, so it's kind of a mix between rural and suburban.  We've got a ton of land, which is great because we have multiple community pools that everyone can use. They're always well-kept and have those fancy gates, like a private resort. And there are loads of walking trails for those who like to stroll or take their dogs for a walk. You don't even need to go to a park!  You can just walk or run around the neighborhood and get your exercise in. \n\nMost of the people here are retired, which makes for a really peaceful atmosphere. It's super safe, and everyone looks out for each other. There are a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in, but for the most part, it's a quiet and friendly neighborhood.\n\nThe city itself is surprisingly big, even though it has this small-town vibe. We've got all the basics: a single mall (it's not huge, but it does the job!), a few different grocery stores (from fancy organic ones to bargain outlets), and all the other essentials you'd expect.  It's about a 15-minute drive to get to anything major, but once you're there, you've got plenty of options. \n\nOverall, my neighborhood is pretty typical, safe, well-maintained, and has a lot of nice things like pools and walking trails.  It's not exactly exciting, but it's comfortable and convenient.",
            "My town is like a little world tucked away from the big city, not too far but still its own thing.  It feels like that old saying, \"small town, big heart.\"  My part of town, on the east side, isn't fancy. The houses aren't worth much, and most folks here are just trying to make ends meet. But you know what? It's not a bad place. People are always smiling and saying hello when I walk by. Sure, there's been a few bumps in the road, like a couple of shootings and even a murder a few blocks over. It's sad, especially when  our neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting.  That's the thing about small towns, everything feels closer, you know? \n\n\nWe've been lucky, though. Nothing too bad has happened to us directly, just the usual stuff like someone taking our stuff off the porch if we forget to bring it in.\n\nBut the whole town has been hit hard by this whole drug thing, the opioid epidemic. It's taken so many good people. But there are people who care, there are places here that help folks get better, and people are trying to make things right.\n\nThe good news is, the school my son goes to is amazing. The teachers, the principal, everyone there is so good, they make you feel like your kid is the only one that matters. My son is a little different, but he's never felt picked on, never felt like he didn't belong. They really do take care of everyone there. \n\nAnd the best part? The school feeds every kid breakfast and lunch for free. They don't want anyone going hungry. It's a big deal because a lot of families here struggle to make ends meet. \n\nThe town itself is working hard to be better too. They've fixed up the roads, planted flowers, and made the parks nicer. It's just that most of that work has been done on the other side of town, where all the stores and stuff are.  We get a little left out over here on the east side.\n\nBut you know what?  We have our own things here too. We have a tight-knit community, good people, and a place that feels like home.  \n\nIt's not perfect, but we love it here. We've been here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine going anywhere else.",
            "My neighbourhood, it's a tapestry woven with stories.  It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of times gone by. My home is a seven-story apartment building, right across from the old live theater, a place where the ghosts of forgotten performances still linger. Just down the hill, there's this small arcade bar, a haven for all sorts of folks, especially on warm summer nights.  Lines form, stretching down the block, especially in June and July, as if the warmth draws them in like moths to a flame. A few blocks up, there's the city park, a green oasis in the heart of it all. It's bigger than you'd expect for this part of town, encircled by concrete with grand, sweeping stairs carved into its walls.\n\nWhen winter's icy grip tightens its hold, the park becomes a temporary home for those who have nowhere else to go.  They set up their tents in neat rows, huddled together for warmth against the biting winds and relentless rain.  It's not snow that chills them, but the lack of shelter.  Being together, in the heart of the city, keeps them a little warmer, a little safer. They're also within reach of the nearest family center, a beacon of hope where they can find a hot shower and a moment of respite.\n\nBut what truly makes my neighborhood special, what binds us together, isn't the history etched into the buildings or the charming architecture that spills down the rolling hills towards the ocean. It's the people, their stories, their resilience. Hilltop, you see, once wore a darker crown, notorious for gang violence that echoed through its streets.  The memories linger, whispered tales passed down through generations, stories of federal crackdowns and the DEA's relentless pursuit.  The people remember, though they've worked hard, even in the shadow of that past, to clean up the streets, to reclaim their neighborhood.  They still care, fiercely, about what happens in their corner of the world. \n\nThey say, with a hint of caution, that if you're white, you shouldn't walk alone at night. A relic of the past, perhaps, a reminder of a time when fear ruled, when assumptions were made, and prejudice cast its long shadow. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees something in me, a kindred spirit who recognizes the deep-seated scars of injustice.  We are both painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation, the echoes of racism, cultural conditioning, and fear disguised as ignorance.\n\nBut I know this: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. The pulse of the city beats strongest here, and I feel alive walking its streets, bathed in the warm glow of streetlights. I meet people who offer me a jacket before I can even ask, who see beyond the surface and offer a genuine connection. It's a place where the laundromat owner stays open a little later so I can charge my phone in the pouring rain, and where someone stops and hands me five dollars, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable on the bleakest of nights.  This is where I belong.",
            "My life is a slice of Americana, right here in small-town Michigan. It's like stepping back in time, with rolling farmland giving way to quaint tourist spots. Forget those big city chains - no bustling malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee's in sight!  You gotta hop in the car to get to anything, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.  You see, I live surrounded by the kind of beauty that takes your breath away. \n\nMy little town sits nestled between two shimmering lakes - Lake Michigan on one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other.  Beaches are practically on every corner, just begging for a dip. \n\nMy neighborhood? It's like stepping into a postcard of Middle America.  Houses aren't stacked on top of each other like in the city; they're unique, each with its own story to tell.  Some have been updated, some are vintage beauties, but they all have that cozy charm. Most have full basements peeking out from the ground, and the colors just paint a happy picture - every shade imaginable!  \n\nOut front, you'll find gardens bursting with life, playful trampolines bouncing with kids, and swings sets creaking with laughter. Some folks even have fences for their furry friends. \n\nThis is where hard-working families thrive. You see kids zipping around on bikes, dogs getting their afternoon stroll, neighbors waving and chatting. Everyone knows everyone, and you can tell who belongs and who's just passing through. \n\nThe lawns are perfect, green and manicured, not a single fallen leaf out of place. It's not about fancy mansions, but about that feeling of home and belonging.\n\nIt's a quiet place, peaceful and safe - the kind of place where you can raise a family and build a life.  The Sheriff's department and jail are just down the road, keeping things safe, and the Health department is right next door.  The recycling center is always buzzing, and everyone uses it.   \n\nBaseball games echo through the air, with excited announcers calling out plays, and nearby, the small airport's planes take off and land, adding a touch of adventure to the everyday.  If you're craving ice cream, you can stroll a few blocks to the local shop, and if you're feeling adventurous, you can even bike downtown.  The park is just around the corner, perfect for a family picnic. \n\nIt may not be glamorous, but it's where my heart belongs. It's a special place, a haven where people feel safe and connected."
