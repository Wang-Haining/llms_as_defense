            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood is a patchwork of houses, some single-family and others split into two attached units. My home boasts a small front yard and a driveway to the left, reminiscent of the suburban dream that once captivated our country. That dream, though fading, still clings to us and to the neighborhood, calling upon us to hold onto it. The residents, while not as optimistic as they once were, still maintain a sense of community, with cars in every driveway and kids playing in the streets. The public school, standing for nearly a century, serves as a beacon of the future for the youth and a nostalgic reminder for the elders. The churches are sparse and often empty, but the basketball courts remain filled with activity. Each house carries its unique story, yet all feel the same.

Many residents have lived here for generations, each with stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. A former karate school, now a pharmacy, serves as a reminder of the changing times, while a movie theater showcases old films, attracting the older crowd who appreciate the quiet escape. A single expressway runs through town, with entrances and exits in the neighboring town. A past petition for an exit in our town failed, as the youth's support was no match for the elders' resistance. The elders argued that it would ruin the town, and the city council agreed.

            "The mountains are a constant presence. They stand tall in the north, greeting the sun's rise and set with unwavering loyalty. No matter how absorbed I am with work or life, they remain steadfast and unshaken by life's challenges. On days when stress and anxiety overwhelm me, they call out to be seen, and with their silent strength, they offer solace and the resolve to keep moving forward, one day at a time. I first came to live here during my undergraduate years, and the mountains north of campus were the first to captivate me. While the university has its share of stunning sights in architecture, water, and greenery, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is beautiful, with countless cafes that have been the backdrop to many hours of caffeine-fueled studying. Just a short walk or bus ride from the campus, you're enveloped in an old-world charm that rivals that of the bustling, neighboring city. This blend of atmospheres, from the frenetic energy of the downtown area to the quiet serenity of the residential neighborhoods, creates a unique vibe that encourages exploration and discovery. Here, memories are forged, whether it's laughing with friends after an all-nighter past the rusted park swings or racing through the downtown to catch a movie in the fancy theater. Yet, the town also holds memories of hardship, as every place does in life. The ponds, in particular, have seen many a tear shed in the quiet of the night, reflecting on life's mysteries. As I walked past the pond and the park with its suburban homes, the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees, painting the sky a vibrant blue and yellow. As I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north, and there they were, as they always had been. The towering mountains dominated the hazy horizon, and with their silent, steadfast presence, they ignited a sense of resilience within me.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it. Public transit is super convenient, a staple of New York City living. Bensonhurt is quite urban, so it feels like you're right in the heart of NYC. Expect to see a plethora of Asian stores which have been popping up over the past couple of decades. Asian supermarkets and laundromats are abundant, known for their high-quality food and reasonable prices. In my area alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. It's not all Asian though; Bensonhurt is diverse, with immigrants and their American-born children living side by side. Many local businesses are Asian-owned, alongside a recently renovated park with multiple basketball courts, a large soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. The park is inclusive, welcoming people of all backgrounds. Corporate buildings are scarce; most homes are two-family houses. The residents are mostly friendly, but it can be noisy with cars blasting music and revving engines. At night, while Bensonhurt is generally safe, be cautious. You may encounter trouble-makers or package thieves. I've experienced physical assaults in the past, but that was years ago. Package thieves are common, and dog waste is a persistent issue. Despite the city's fine for not cleaning up after dogs, people often ignore it. Every morning, you'll find dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. It's a pet peeve of mine! Keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, there aren't many sidewalks, and the road goes downhill like a workout, leading people to call it the \"work out hill.\" Joggers love it for their daily runs. The street's condition isn't great; it's pitted and a bit dangerous to drive on. The wiring and power lines are tattered and need constant repair, especially after storms. There are tall evergreen trees everywhere, but locals don't like them; they cut down as many as possible to see the ocean. Many houses have large glass-fronted second stories to take in the view of the bay. The sunset is stunning, with the water lit from below and the sky turning orange, but the weather's often cloudy, and moss grows on everything due to the dampness. It's common to see cats chasing rabbits and dogs running in the streets. The school nearby means there are hardly any kids, but dogs are everywhere. Birds and the occasional hawk or eagle can be seen, and some restaurants serve fresh seafood along the waterfront, with rocks great for throwing into the water. The bay isn't wide, and you can see the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee, right at the crossroads of two state highways, which means I get a bit more traffic on my street than I'd prefer. Otherwise, it's a quiet neighborhood. There aren't many newcomers, so I'm pretty familiar with most of the folks that live around here. Everyone keeps busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we have sledding on the street, and since our house is at the corner, we see all the comings and goings throughout the day. We tend to take note of any unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs, and kids are out on their bikes. We're mostly home-based, with me, my wife, and our two daughters – aged eleven and fourteen – so everyone is used to seeing us around. We do enjoy outdoor activities, even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill on our back deck; the smell of barbecue always brings a pleasant atmosphere. From March until October, you can hear the lawn mowers nearly every day as the grass grows. The neighborhood has plenty of trees, originally a wooded area, which offers lots of shade. But that means we have to rake and burn leaves every Fall, which I actually enjoy as it signals the arrival of Fall. We've had minimal winter weather lately, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is quite rare. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quite quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees families visiting from out of town, with extra cars parked everywhere. The same goes for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I like living here; if it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood sits right smack in the middle of the high desert, where dirt, dirt, and more dirt are all you see. Unless you've actually lived here, it's hard to understand what it feels like to always look at brown, except for the few lawns you see, which must cost a fortune to maintain. Back in the 90s, houses were spread out, but now it's the same, with a lot of new additions making it look more like a city every day. Sure, most places are changing, but this one's got its own charm. The locals are friendly, especially the old-timers, and the stores are mostly chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. You won't find Whole Foods or stores like that here; it takes a drive to get them. Construction jobs are the most common, likely because the city is still developing, with plenty of open spaces to build on. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and I love my job. Living here, we've adapted to the unique wildlife. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, always trying to catch them. Victorville offers fun things for families to do, like visiting the San Bernardino County Fair. You can also check out the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood and learn about the high desert's natural history and culture at the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I reckon my response is somewhat one of a kind. While others who answer this are likely homeowners leading their own lives, mine is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the people sharing my dormitory to be my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Nevertheless, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more traditional concepts. Just like any ordinary neighborhood, mine has houses, folks, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before we do, let's clarify the housing types in my area. There are three main types: apartments, personal houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, each room houses 2-4 individuals, with about 4-6 rooms per floor. Average occupancy per building is around 20 people. Then there are the actual houses, typically 2-4 bedrooms, mainly inhabited by alumni. These are fewer in number and less efficient. Lastly, there are dorm rooms, housing 100's of students, usually two sharing a room. This is the most common housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people. My school touts diversity, which is evident in the folks living in my neighborhood. Professional staff often live in the neighborhood houses, newer students in the dorms, and older students in the apartments. Describing the folks here does them no justice, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is practically a self-contained neighborhood, it boasts a wide range of stores and a single park. The stores offer dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, so anything needed can be found within the neighborhood's boundaries. The park is a playground for the diverse folks in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe by all its members!",
            "Well, I've been living here for about 10 years now, so I can share some insights. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a bit tough at first. I missed my old neighborhood, but my parents wanted the best for my sister and me. We found a better place to live, with a better high school and a housing situation that wasn't considered \"ghetto.\" It took some getting used to, but I made some friends and even some enemies in school. I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been great people, almost like family, and I truly appreciate them. I recall when I, my mom, dad, and sister went to Mr. Glen's wedding (he got re-married). It was a fun time, and I'm looking forward to giving my future wife the life of a queen someday. When Ms. Veda threw the flowers at the wedding, I caught the veil but not the flowers. We danced the night away, and I really enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of the daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but with my GPS, I can explore more. I've only gone so far, mainly when hanging out with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We loved playing video games and enjoying life. Sometimes I'd head to the park to find peace and calmness. I bring sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and use my bokken wooden sword if I can. I find it fun to do what I love. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a long time. My dad taught me tennis with Mr. Graves when I was a kid, and we always had a great time, even if it was tough. There are plenty of fun memories, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood, being adjacent to the college I attend, makes living here quite enjoyable. A mixture of apartment buildings, restaurants, and bars populate the area, with one bar having recently been renamed. While this bar is now more expensive, it offers decent service and drinks. The locals are generally nice, comprising mostly college students and lower-income residents due to the affordable rental prices. An elementary school nearby has led to a significant number of children in the area. I don't know my neighbors very well, and to be honest, I don't mind. Some of them smoke quite a bit of weed, which led the building's management to install an air freshener unit near their door. While this might seem funny to my boyfriend and me, it's somewhat insulting. The buildings around me generally look old, though some have been renovated on the inside. Further down the street are newer apartments, but I suspect their construction quality is subpar given their cheap rent. A small, affordable restaurant a five-minute walk from my place serves food on paper plates and uses a microwave for most of their dishes. Across from it is a gas station that isn't highly regarded, but thanks to recent city funding, the road has been improved with a large sidewalk and plenty of greenery, making the area somewhat nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps where some were cut down, but there are more trees here than on the road. Behind my complex lies another row of apartments. My street, 42nd, is relatively pleasant, but 43rd nearby is somewhat shabby, with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. While there's more greenery here to hide the buildings' appearances, it also tends to mask the higher crime rates, especially at an apartment complex on that street. However, I find the area affordable and convenient, with the university within walking distance and two bus stops nearby for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a cul-de-sac filled with duplexes that are randomly placed to appear like individual houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, making them look identical. Most duplexes are owned by friends, and we often gather at the end of the not pre-arranged driveway to chat while our kids play with their toys or fly kites. It's a refreshing change in this tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. The surroundings are beautiful—fields, trees, blue skies, and white fluffy clouds. However, this season, we've been facing tornado warnings. Last night, we heard actual sirens, so we took shelter. My smallest dog and I huddled in the bathtub with my purse and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop. We went from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sun came out, and it started to rain, forming a double rainbow. I snapped some pictures to share on Facebook. The streets were quiet for another hour before people started returning home. Then it was business as usual—moms and kids outside, dinner cooking. It's a welcoming neighborhood for this gal who just moved from NH to NC. I love the Southern accents. I live in a two-bed, two-bath apartment, as do most people here. Despite similar exteriors, interiors vary in size—some are quite small. I enjoy walking to the field behind my house and heading to the non-swimming pond. I've seen deer there, and in the morning, I can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a neighboring farm that brayes in the evening to let us know he's there. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right when I was about to start eighth grade. It was a bit tough making friends at first, but I eventually got close to someone two houses down and another guy on my street. Neither of them live here anymore, but the memories are still vivid. The same folks who were here when I first moved are largely still around. Our neighborhood is pretty much your average American suburban setup. Two-story houses are common, and every weekend, or whenever it's warm, you hear kids outside playing. Weekdays are generally quiet, but you're left alone unless you need help. I've never had any issues with the neighbors. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one snatched. You can trust your neighbors here. There's a park a couple of minutes away with a lot of memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood kids. I even have one bad memory from there – getting my nose elbowed during a football game, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I often go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're younger than me and still love playing on swings and slides. Just thinking about the park brings back so many memories. The neighborhood is diverse, with all kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But nowadays, a lot of people just use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. The stores in the area have everything you need. There are multiple dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're in the mood for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm really fond of this neighborhood. Reading about horror stories on social media and seeing the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a small, cozy town in South Carolina. It doesn't stand out much from other towns, but it's got a big impact on the local ag sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, and they're proud to show it off on the town's welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are spread out, usually two stories with metal or gray shingle roofs to beat the summer heat. They're not near the road, but further back so the front fields can be used for crops or animals. In the main part of town, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where the only stores are. There's fast food in the form of a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican place, and a small burger joint. A pizzeria closed down recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, best known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA, but many people prefer to shop at Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The most popular store is Dollar General, which is busy from morning till night. There's a small furniture store run by a friendly woman, Possibilities Furniture & More, and attached to it is a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Both a doctor's and vet's office are located away from the main town area. There's a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but middle and high school students have to go to the next town over. There's no parks yet, but they're working on a 2.5 acre recreational area. There isn't much to do; no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small you can miss it in a blink!",
            "The first time I heard about the neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit unexpected. Nearly every apartment was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard about this before, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it’s the everyday struggle. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, but we've learned how to be thrifty over the years. You start to enjoy the smell of old toys and worn-out clothes from the flea market. You can't smell as much in adulthood. You might start smoking, or you just get used to it. But the flea market always finds a way to get to you. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It gets stuck in the leather and stays even after you clean it. Over here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you’d never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or vehicles pass by, the store remains quiet. It’s a great place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there seem to be more and more people. Cars and people are flooding the city. They say it’s a developing city, with one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery hubs. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It’s not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don’t pry into anyone’s life here. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like waves on the beach. It’s an active place to be. With the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there’s always something going on. In a way, we have more of a community than a group of strangers. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I’m lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them mail and they return the favor. It's nice seeing them and I believe they appreciate my company as much as I do theirs. I live in an expansive, impersonal urban jungle, but it’s the people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven’t ruined my life completely.",
            "The area where I reside is a quintessential cookie-cutter suburb, with a noticeable emphasis on uniformity. Upon entering, the neatness is immediately apparent. Single-family homes, meticulously maintained, line the streets, all thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are consistent, with small grassy patches, decorative pebbles, and driveway space. The occasional tree adds a touch of nature. Every house boasts a two-car garage, and the roads are always smooth and free of potholes, a testament to the HOA's commitment to upkeep. Most homes are single-story, but some rise to two stories. Instead of the usual individual mailboxes, each household has a key to access their designated mailbox at a communal locker. There are also larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of the city, blending rural and suburban elements. We have a plenty of green spaces and community pools, open to all residents. Walking paths are also available for dog walks or leisure strolls. The area is known for its safety and community spirit, with a mix of retirees, middle-aged professionals, and young families. The city itself is both large and small-town-like, offering a range of amenities. A single mall provides grocery stores, from high-end organic options to budget-friendly outlets. It takes about 15 minutes to reach any significant location, followed by a variety of shopping choices. In summary, my neighborhood is safe, organized, and typical, with plenty of recreational amenities and easy access to shopping.",
            "I hail from a modest Midwestern town, nearly nestled in the suburbs of a large city. My immediate neighborhood, set on the eastern outskirts, is notably the most economically challenged area of town. Residences are largely rented or owned by folks with modest means, but it's not an unattractive place to live. Neighborhood vibes are friendly, with folks greeting you with a smile and a nod as you walk down the street. Crime rates here are slightly higher than other parts of town, with a few unfortunate incidents like shootings and a homicide occurring within a few blocks of my home. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting incident last year, but fortunately, my family has been spared direct victimization, aside from the occasional porch theft if we leave items out overnight. This town has been heavily impacted by the opioid crisis, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, numerous resources are available to combat the epidemic, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for those affected. Despite these challenges, there are many positive aspects. My son's elementary school is top-notch, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He thrives in an inclusive environment, having not faced bullying despite his special needs. The PTO organizes various events promoting family involvement and educational progress. To ensure no child goes hungry, the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, with no costs for fees, supplies, or field trips. Many city improvements have been made, but most have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where commercial activity is vibrant. The east side, where I live, tends to receive less attention, a point of contention for locals. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are excellent, there's a mix of shopping options, and while the value of our home is modest, it's comfortable and sufficient. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood brims with culture, nestled on a hilltop surrounded by buildings rich in history. I call home a 7-story apartment building right across from an old live theater, and just a block down is a quaint little arcade bar that draws various folks on warm summer nights. Weekends in June and July often find a line of people eager to enter. A few more blocks up is the nearest city park, quite spacious for the part of town it's in. Concrete steps encircle the park, with homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and stairs during winter. Rainy conditions make it hard to stay warm, but their proximity to the family center aids them in staying close by. What I admire about my city isn't the grandeur of historic landmarks or the architecture that dots the rolling hills leading to the ocean. It's the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence, and stories of federal crackdowns still echo three decades later. The people here work hard to clean up their neighborhood, despite its rough reputation. The adage, \"If you're white, don't walk around the Hill at night,\" still resonates, but I believe it stems from a past marred by social conditioning. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to seemingly fit in, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of its own, someone deeply aware of our nation's constant reminders of racism and cultural conditioning. No matter where I go, the Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive when I walk those streets at night, encountering folks who offer a jacket or a kind word faster than they'd steal from me. There are moments when I've huddled against storefronts on the greyest of nights, only to receive a $5 bill and praise for my beauty and worth from a stranger.",
            "Hey, I call this place home. Rural America, specifically small town Michigan, where fields meet tourist cities. Forget big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s here. You gotta drive for anything. But let me tell ya, I'm one of the luckiest folks alive, living surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are my neighbors, and every block has a beach. Middle America is alive and well here, with homes that aren't stacked like sardines. Mostly older homes, some with basements that you can see from the road, and older aluminum siding. The colors? Every color of the rainbow. And most yards? Trampolines, playsets, gardens, fences for the animals, and neighbors that know each other. The lawns, they're kept up, no fall leaves, and the bushes? Trimmed down. It's not over the top, but it's got that cozy, safe feeling. Safe enough that kids run up and down the streets, and neighbors wave and smile. Even the sheriff's department and health department are close by, and the county jail too. Recycling, baseball fields, and a small airport are all within walking distance. Ice cream? Just 8 blocks away. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, and we're close enough to downtown. It's not fancy, but it's perfect for raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. And you know what? It's the kind of place you drive into and think, \"Yeah, this is where I want to be.\""

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Since I live in a bustling metropolis, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are haphazardly interspersed with commercial sections, where a wide array of businesses operate, from offices to various stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. You name it, we've got it, with no shortage of new eateries or shops to explore. Some of these stores are famous, large-scale corporations, while others are trendy boutiques that line the streets, drawing in shoppers from otherwise quiet neighborhoods. There are even a couple of nearby parks where families with young children are often seen. The people who live here are just as diverse as the businesses and attractions.

Just a few miles away, there are even more groups of various ethnicities, like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, among others. However, even a short 10-mile drive can take up to two hours due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours. Most people in the city don't walk around; cars are the primary mode of transportation. This leads to some of the worst traffic congestion in the world, making parking spots hard to come by. Ironically, the city has been experiencing a boom in construction, with numerous new apartment buildings going up. While it might seem like a popular place to live, many residents are wary of the increased population and traffic. The city offers a variety of housing options, from large apartment buildings to smaller homes and condominiums. Within my neighborhood alone, there's a mix of single-family homes, duplexes, and other types of residences. The age range of the residents is quite diverse as well, and to be honest, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not like the close-knit community I remember from my childhood, where I used to play with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends.",
            "My neighborhood is a patchwork of houses, some single-family and others split into two attached units. My home boasts a small front yard and a driveway to the left, reminiscent of the suburban dream that once captivated our country. That dream, though fading, still clings to us and to the neighborhood, calling upon us to hold onto it. The residents, while not as optimistic as they once were, still maintain a sense of community, with cars in every driveway and kids playing in the streets. The public school, standing for nearly a century, serves as a beacon of the future for the youth and a nostalgic reminder for the elders. The churches are sparse and often empty, but the basketball courts remain filled with activity. Each house carries its unique story, yet all feel the same. A large supermarket, 'Super A,' is run by a Yemeni family, possibly the sole Arab presence in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American, with the streets wide and filled with kids playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations, each with stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. A former karate school, now a pharmacy, serves as a reminder of the changing times, while a movie theater showcases old films, attracting the older crowd who appreciate the quiet escape. A single expressway runs through town, with entrances and exits in the neighboring town. A past petition for an exit in our town failed, as the youth's support was no match for the elders' resistance. The elders argued that it would ruin the town, and the city council agreed. A new high school is being constructed, and we are debating on a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin could best represent our town.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance – this residential area behind a shopping strip isn't what one would expect to find housing. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that only come alive during summer family reunions, you'll discover a thriving community. This neighborhood hides a collection of apartment complexes, stacked together like Russian nesting dolls, piecemeal and carefully placed in a line down the road. The first ones you'll see have been in the spotlight for some less-than-savory activities, so let's skip over them. The ones beside and beyond them, though, are a different story, almost completely unknown to the locals. Right across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus – a sleepy, quiet place where students come and go with coffee in hand, yawning as they start their days. The iron gates creak open, letting them in, while commuters grumble at the delay, especially on days when attendance is high. The road intersects with another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those who've met with unfortunate injuries on the other side. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a slow, lazy ceiling fan that stirs the hot, thick summer air. Children play in the park, doing cartwheels and stunts in the grass, while bees lazily buzz by in the nearby flower patches. Retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, exchanging nods with teens while eying the skateboarders warily. Beside the park, a strip mall houses a sushi place with affordable food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon nestled between them. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and chow down on hibachi chicken, all in one trip – the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where you'll often see teens with cold, toppings-covered cups, doing tricks on their skateboards and vaping. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana – a piece of history where time seems to stand still.",
            "Where is everything? she asked as we drove past the corn fields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she'd be blown away by the vast open landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her house—she'd never seen so much open space before. Overwhelmed by the corn fields, I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane highway, you'll reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it is the small development where I live. The houses are mostly made of brick and stucco, with each home boasting at least a half-acre of land that everyone takes pride in maintaining. In the spring, the annual flowers and midwestern trees change with each season. The driveways are filled with luxury Mercedes Benz cars that gleam in the sunlight after a good car wash. Continuing along the road towards my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He spends his days mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he's always genuine and has a unique history. Though he's aged and lost some of his wit, he was once a doctor and blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there's a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you'll hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. From building treehouses to \"hunting\" animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood kid to play with. The winters in my small town can be brutal, but there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become barren skeletons of bark. When snowfall blesses the town, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my sister and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We'd build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland, we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.",
            "Portland, Oregon, is a place that's known for its quirks and eccentricities, with the unofficial town slogan being \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This isn't just a throwback to the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, but a call to embrace a unique culture. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't just about being open to the unconventional; it's about taking things less seriously. We have yoga and hipsters, business professionals and families. In my neighborhood, you'll find colorful houses, gardens with flowers and herbs, and free boxes. These boxes contain treasures, sometimes clothes, books, or even other items, left by someone who no longer needs them. It's a magical experience walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood, but it's just one of many ways Portland's weirdness manifests. There are goat yoga classes and Timbers soccer matches, dreams pursued and dreams chased in bars. Portland has its issues, like drug and homelessness problems, but it's not afraid to face them head-on. The non-homeless population is divided between compassion and frustration, but that's not what makes Portland weird. That's just Portland being Portland.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence. They stand tall in the north, greeting the sun's rise and set with unwavering loyalty. No matter how absorbed I am with work or life, they remain steadfast and unshaken by life's challenges. On days when stress and anxiety overwhelm me, they call out to be seen, and with their silent strength, they offer solace and the resolve to keep moving forward, one day at a time. I first came to live here during my undergraduate years, and the mountains north of campus were the first to captivate me. While the university has its share of stunning sights in architecture, water, and greenery, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is beautiful, with countless cafes that have been the backdrop to many hours of caffeine-fueled studying. Just a short walk or bus ride from the campus, you're enveloped in an old-world charm that rivals that of the bustling, neighboring city. This blend of atmospheres, from the frenetic energy of the downtown area to the quiet serenity of the residential neighborhoods, creates a unique vibe that encourages exploration and discovery. Here, memories are forged, whether it's laughing with friends after an all-nighter past the rusted park swings or racing through the downtown to catch a movie in the fancy theater. Yet, the town also holds memories of hardship, as every place does in life. The ponds, in particular, have seen many a tear shed in the quiet of the night, reflecting on life's mysteries. As I walked past the pond and the park with its suburban homes, the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees, painting the sky a vibrant blue and yellow. As I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north, and there they were, as they always had been. The towering mountains dominated the hazy horizon, and with their silent, steadfast presence, they ignited a sense of resilience within me.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it. Public transit is super convenient, a staple of New York City living. Bensonhurt is quite urban, so it feels like you're right in the heart of NYC. Expect to see a plethora of Asian stores which have been popping up over the past couple of decades. Asian supermarkets and laundromats are abundant, known for their high-quality food and reasonable prices. In my area alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. It's not all Asian though; Bensonhurt is diverse, with immigrants and their American-born children living side by side. Many local businesses are Asian-owned, alongside a recently renovated park with multiple basketball courts, a large soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. The park is inclusive, welcoming people of all backgrounds. Corporate buildings are scarce; most homes are two-family houses. The residents are mostly friendly, but it can be noisy with cars blasting music and revving engines. At night, while Bensonhurt is generally safe, be cautious. You may encounter trouble-makers or package thieves. I've experienced physical assaults in the past, but that was years ago. Package thieves are common, and dog waste is a persistent issue. Despite the city's fine for not cleaning up after dogs, people often ignore it. Every morning, you'll find dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. It's a pet peeve of mine! Keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, there aren't many sidewalks, and the road goes downhill like a workout, leading people to call it the \"work out hill.\" Joggers love it for their daily runs. The street's condition isn't great; it's pitted and a bit dangerous to drive on. The wiring and power lines are tattered and need constant repair, especially after storms. There are tall evergreen trees everywhere, but locals don't like them; they cut down as many as possible to see the ocean. Many houses have large glass-fronted second stories to take in the view of the bay. The sunset is stunning, with the water lit from below and the sky turning orange, but the weather's often cloudy, and moss grows on everything due to the dampness. It's common to see cats chasing rabbits and dogs running in the streets. The school nearby means there are hardly any kids, but dogs are everywhere. Birds and the occasional hawk or eagle can be seen, and some restaurants serve fresh seafood along the waterfront, with rocks great for throwing into the water. The bay isn't wide, and you can see the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee, right at the crossroads of two state highways, which means I get a bit more traffic on my street than I'd prefer. Otherwise, it's a quiet neighborhood. There aren't many newcomers, so I'm pretty familiar with most of the folks that live around here. Everyone keeps busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we have sledding on the street, and since our house is at the corner, we see all the comings and goings throughout the day. We tend to take note of any unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs, and kids are out on their bikes. We're mostly home-based, with me, my wife, and our two daughters – aged eleven and fourteen – so everyone is used to seeing us around. We do enjoy outdoor activities, even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill on our back deck; the smell of barbecue always brings a pleasant atmosphere. From March until October, you can hear the lawn mowers nearly every day as the grass grows. The neighborhood has plenty of trees, originally a wooded area, which offers lots of shade. But that means we have to rake and burn leaves every Fall, which I actually enjoy as it signals the arrival of Fall. We've had minimal winter weather lately, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is quite rare. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quite quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees families visiting from out of town, with extra cars parked everywhere. The same goes for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I like living here; if it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood sits right smack in the middle of the high desert, where dirt, dirt, and more dirt are all you see. Unless you've actually lived here, it's hard to understand what it feels like to always look at brown, except for the few lawns you see, which must cost a fortune to maintain. Back in the 90s, houses were spread out, but now it's the same, with a lot of new additions making it look more like a city every day. Sure, most places are changing, but this one's got its own charm. The locals are friendly, especially the old-timers, and the stores are mostly chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. You won't find Whole Foods or stores like that here; it takes a drive to get them. Construction jobs are the most common, likely because the city is still developing, with plenty of open spaces to build on. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and I love my job. Living here, we've adapted to the unique wildlife. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, always trying to catch them. Victorville offers fun things for families to do, like visiting the San Bernardino County Fair. You can also check out the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood and learn about the high desert's natural history and culture at the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I reckon my response is somewhat one of a kind. While others who answer this are likely homeowners leading their own lives, mine is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the people sharing my dormitory to be my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Nevertheless, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more traditional concepts. Just like any ordinary neighborhood, mine has houses, folks, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before we do, let's clarify the housing types in my area. There are three main types: apartments, personal houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, each room houses 2-4 individuals, with about 4-6 rooms per floor. Average occupancy per building is around 20 people. Then there are the actual houses, typically 2-4 bedrooms, mainly inhabited by alumni. These are fewer in number and less efficient. Lastly, there are dorm rooms, housing 100's of students, usually two sharing a room. This is the most common housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people. My school touts diversity, which is evident in the folks living in my neighborhood. Professional staff often live in the neighborhood houses, newer students in the dorms, and older students in the apartments. Describing the folks here does them no justice, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is practically a self-contained neighborhood, it boasts a wide range of stores and a single park. The stores offer dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, so anything needed can be found within the neighborhood's boundaries. The park is a playground for the diverse folks in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe by all its members!",
            "Well, I've been living here for about 10 years now, so I can share some insights. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a bit tough at first. I missed my old neighborhood, but my parents wanted the best for my sister and me. We found a better place to live, with a better high school and a housing situation that wasn't considered \"ghetto.\" It took some getting used to, but I made some friends and even some enemies in school. I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been great people, almost like family, and I truly appreciate them. I recall when I, my mom, dad, and sister went to Mr. Glen's wedding (he got re-married). It was a fun time, and I'm looking forward to giving my future wife the life of a queen someday. When Ms. Veda threw the flowers at the wedding, I caught the veil but not the flowers. We danced the night away, and I really enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of the daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but with my GPS, I can explore more. I've only gone so far, mainly when hanging out with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We loved playing video games and enjoying life. Sometimes I'd head to the park to find peace and calmness. I bring sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and use my bokken wooden sword if I can. I find it fun to do what I love. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a long time. My dad taught me tennis with Mr. Graves when I was a kid, and we always had a great time, even if it was tough. There are plenty of fun memories, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood, being adjacent to the college I attend, makes living here quite enjoyable. A mixture of apartment buildings, restaurants, and bars populate the area, with one bar having recently been renamed. While this bar is now more expensive, it offers decent service and drinks. The locals are generally nice, comprising mostly college students and lower-income residents due to the affordable rental prices. An elementary school nearby has led to a significant number of children in the area. I don't know my neighbors very well, and to be honest, I don't mind. Some of them smoke quite a bit of weed, which led the building's management to install an air freshener unit near their door. While this might seem funny to my boyfriend and me, it's somewhat insulting. The buildings around me generally look old, though some have been renovated on the inside. Further down the street are newer apartments, but I suspect their construction quality is subpar given their cheap rent. A small, affordable restaurant a five-minute walk from my place serves food on paper plates and uses a microwave for most of their dishes. Across from it is a gas station that isn't highly regarded, but thanks to recent city funding, the road has been improved with a large sidewalk and plenty of greenery, making the area somewhat nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps where some were cut down, but there are more trees here than on the road. Behind my complex lies another row of apartments. My street, 42nd, is relatively pleasant, but 43rd nearby is somewhat shabby, with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. While there's more greenery here to hide the buildings' appearances, it also tends to mask the higher crime rates, especially at an apartment complex on that street. However, I find the area affordable and convenient, with the university within walking distance and two bus stops nearby for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a cul-de-sac filled with duplexes that are randomly placed to appear like individual houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, making them look identical. Most duplexes are owned by friends, and we often gather at the end of the not pre-arranged driveway to chat while our kids play with their toys or fly kites. It's a refreshing change in this tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. The surroundings are beautiful—fields, trees, blue skies, and white fluffy clouds. However, this season, we've been facing tornado warnings. Last night, we heard actual sirens, so we took shelter. My smallest dog and I huddled in the bathtub with my purse and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop. We went from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sun came out, and it started to rain, forming a double rainbow. I snapped some pictures to share on Facebook. The streets were quiet for another hour before people started returning home. Then it was business as usual—moms and kids outside, dinner cooking. It's a welcoming neighborhood for this gal who just moved from NH to NC. I love the Southern accents. I live in a two-bed, two-bath apartment, as do most people here. Despite similar exteriors, interiors vary in size—some are quite small. I enjoy walking to the field behind my house and heading to the non-swimming pond. I've seen deer there, and in the morning, I can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a neighboring farm that brayes in the evening to let us know he's there. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right when I was about to start eighth grade. It was a bit tough making friends at first, but I eventually got close to someone two houses down and another guy on my street. Neither of them live here anymore, but the memories are still vivid. The same folks who were here when I first moved are largely still around. Our neighborhood is pretty much your average American suburban setup. Two-story houses are common, and every weekend, or whenever it's warm, you hear kids outside playing. Weekdays are generally quiet, but you're left alone unless you need help. I've never had any issues with the neighbors. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one snatched. You can trust your neighbors here. There's a park a couple of minutes away with a lot of memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood kids. I even have one bad memory from there – getting my nose elbowed during a football game, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I often go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're younger than me and still love playing on swings and slides. Just thinking about the park brings back so many memories. The neighborhood is diverse, with all kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But nowadays, a lot of people just use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. The stores in the area have everything you need. There are multiple dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're in the mood for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm really fond of this neighborhood. Reading about horror stories on social media and seeing the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a small, cozy town in South Carolina. It doesn't stand out much from other towns, but it's got a big impact on the local ag sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, and they're proud to show it off on the town's welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are spread out, usually two stories with metal or gray shingle roofs to beat the summer heat. They're not near the road, but further back so the front fields can be used for crops or animals. In the main part of town, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where the only stores are. There's fast food in the form of a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican place, and a small burger joint. A pizzeria closed down recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, best known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA, but many people prefer to shop at Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The most popular store is Dollar General, which is busy from morning till night. There's a small furniture store run by a friendly woman, Possibilities Furniture & More, and attached to it is a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Both a doctor's and vet's office are located away from the main town area. There's a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but middle and high school students have to go to the next town over. There's no parks yet, but they're working on a 2.5 acre recreational area. There isn't much to do; no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small you can miss it in a blink!",
            "The first time I heard about the neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit unexpected. Nearly every apartment was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard about this before, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it’s the everyday struggle. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, but we've learned how to be thrifty over the years. You start to enjoy the smell of old toys and worn-out clothes from the flea market. You can't smell as much in adulthood. You might start smoking, or you just get used to it. But the flea market always finds a way to get to you. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It gets stuck in the leather and stays even after you clean it. Over here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you’d never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or vehicles pass by, the store remains quiet. It’s a great place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there seem to be more and more people. Cars and people are flooding the city. They say it’s a developing city, with one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery hubs. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It’s not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don’t pry into anyone’s life here. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like waves on the beach. It’s an active place to be. With the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there’s always something going on. In a way, we have more of a community than a group of strangers. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I’m lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them mail and they return the favor. It's nice seeing them and I believe they appreciate my company as much as I do theirs. I live in an expansive, impersonal urban jungle, but it’s the people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven’t ruined my life completely.",
            "The area where I reside is a quintessential cookie-cutter suburb, with a noticeable emphasis on uniformity. Upon entering, the neatness is immediately apparent. Single-family homes, meticulously maintained, line the streets, all thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are consistent, with small grassy patches, decorative pebbles, and driveway space. The occasional tree adds a touch of nature. Every house boasts a two-car garage, and the roads are always smooth and free of potholes, a testament to the HOA's commitment to upkeep. Most homes are single-story, but some rise to two stories. Instead of the usual individual mailboxes, each household has a key to access their designated mailbox at a communal locker. There are also larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of the city, blending rural and suburban elements. We have a plenty of green spaces and community pools, open to all residents. Walking paths are also available for dog walks or leisure strolls. The area is known for its safety and community spirit, with a mix of retirees, middle-aged professionals, and young families. The city itself is both large and small-town-like, offering a range of amenities. A single mall provides grocery stores, from high-end organic options to budget-friendly outlets. It takes about 15 minutes to reach any significant location, followed by a variety of shopping choices. In summary, my neighborhood is safe, organized, and typical, with plenty of recreational amenities and easy access to shopping.",
            "I hail from a modest Midwestern town, nearly nestled in the suburbs of a large city. My immediate neighborhood, set on the eastern outskirts, is notably the most economically challenged area of town. Residences are largely rented or owned by folks with modest means, but it's not an unattractive place to live. Neighborhood vibes are friendly, with folks greeting you with a smile and a nod as you walk down the street. Crime rates here are slightly higher than other parts of town, with a few unfortunate incidents like shootings and a homicide occurring within a few blocks of my home. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting incident last year, but fortunately, my family has been spared direct victimization, aside from the occasional porch theft if we leave items out overnight. This town has been heavily impacted by the opioid crisis, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, numerous resources are available to combat the epidemic, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for those affected. Despite these challenges, there are many positive aspects. My son's elementary school is top-notch, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He thrives in an inclusive environment, having not faced bullying despite his special needs. The PTO organizes various events promoting family involvement and educational progress. To ensure no child goes hungry, the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, with no costs for fees, supplies, or field trips. Many city improvements have been made, but most have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where commercial activity is vibrant. The east side, where I live, tends to receive less attention, a point of contention for locals. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are excellent, there's a mix of shopping options, and while the value of our home is modest, it's comfortable and sufficient. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood brims with culture, nestled on a hilltop surrounded by buildings rich in history. I call home a 7-story apartment building right across from an old live theater, and just a block down is a quaint little arcade bar that draws various folks on warm summer nights. Weekends in June and July often find a line of people eager to enter. A few more blocks up is the nearest city park, quite spacious for the part of town it's in. Concrete steps encircle the park, with homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and stairs during winter. Rainy conditions make it hard to stay warm, but their proximity to the family center aids them in staying close by. What I admire about my city isn't the grandeur of historic landmarks or the architecture that dots the rolling hills leading to the ocean. It's the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence, and stories of federal crackdowns still echo three decades later. The people here work hard to clean up their neighborhood, despite its rough reputation. The adage, \"If you're white, don't walk around the Hill at night,\" still resonates, but I believe it stems from a past marred by social conditioning. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to seemingly fit in, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of its own, someone deeply aware of our nation's constant reminders of racism and cultural conditioning. No matter where I go, the Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive when I walk those streets at night, encountering folks who offer a jacket or a kind word faster than they'd steal from me. There are moments when I've huddled against storefronts on the greyest of nights, only to receive a $5 bill and praise for my beauty and worth from a stranger.",
            "Hey, I call this place home. Rural America, specifically small town Michigan, where fields meet tourist cities. Forget big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s here. You gotta drive for anything. But let me tell ya, I'm one of the luckiest folks alive, living surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are my neighbors, and every block has a beach. Middle America is alive and well here, with homes that aren't stacked like sardines. Mostly older homes, some with basements that you can see from the road, and older aluminum siding. The colors? Every color of the rainbow. And most yards? Trampolines, playsets, gardens, fences for the animals, and neighbors that know each other. The lawns, they're kept up, no fall leaves, and the bushes? Trimmed down. It's not over the top, but it's got that cozy, safe feeling. Safe enough that kids run up and down the streets, and neighbors wave and smile. Even the sheriff's department and health department are close by, and the county jail too. Recycling, baseball fields, and a small airport are all within walking distance. Ice cream? Just 8 blocks away. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, and we're close enough to downtown. It's not fancy, but it's perfect for raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. And you know what? It's the kind of place you drive into and think, \"Yeah, this is where I want to be.\""

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Since I live in a bustling metropolis, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are haphazardly interspersed with commercial sections, where a wide array of businesses operate, from offices to various stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. You name it, we've got it, with no shortage of new eateries or shops to explore. Some of these stores are famous, large-scale corporations, while others are trendy boutiques that line the streets, drawing in shoppers from otherwise quiet neighborhoods. There are even a couple of nearby parks where families with young children are often seen. The people who live here are just as diverse as the businesses and attractions. Just in one small area, we have a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish population, and a contingent of former Soviet Union refugees and immigrants. Just a few miles away, there are even more groups of various ethnicities, like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, among others. However, even a short 10-mile drive can take up to two hours due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours. Most people in the city don't walk around; cars are the primary mode of transportation. This leads to some of the worst traffic congestion in the world, making parking spots hard to come by. Ironically, the city has been experiencing a boom in construction, with numerous new apartment buildings going up. While it might seem like a popular place to live, many residents are wary of the increased population and traffic. The city offers a variety of housing options, from large apartment buildings to smaller homes and condominiums. Within my neighborhood alone, there's a mix of single-family homes, duplexes, and other types of residences. The age range of the residents is quite diverse as well, and to be honest, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not like the close-knit community I remember from my childhood, where I used to play with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends.",
            "My neighborhood is a patchwork of houses, some single-family and others split into two attached units. My home boasts a small front yard and a driveway to the left, reminiscent of the suburban dream that once captivated our country. That dream, though fading, still clings to us and to the neighborhood, calling upon us to hold onto it. The residents, while not as optimistic as they once were, still maintain a sense of community, with cars in every driveway and kids playing in the streets. The public school, standing for nearly a century, serves as a beacon of the future for the youth and a nostalgic reminder for the elders. The churches are sparse and often empty, but the basketball courts remain filled with activity. Each house carries its unique story, yet all feel the same. A large supermarket, 'Super A,' is run by a Yemeni family, possibly the sole Arab presence in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American, with the streets wide and filled with kids playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations, each with stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. A former karate school, now a pharmacy, serves as a reminder of the changing times, while a movie theater showcases old films, attracting the older crowd who appreciate the quiet escape. A single expressway runs through town, with entrances and exits in the neighboring town. A past petition for an exit in our town failed, as the youth's support was no match for the elders' resistance. The elders argued that it would ruin the town, and the city council agreed. A new high school is being constructed, and we are debating on a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin could best represent our town.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance – this residential area behind a shopping strip isn't what one would expect to find housing. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that only come alive during summer family reunions, you'll discover a thriving community. This neighborhood hides a collection of apartment complexes, stacked together like Russian nesting dolls, piecemeal and carefully placed in a line down the road. The first ones you'll see have been in the spotlight for some less-than-savory activities, so let's skip over them. The ones beside and beyond them, though, are a different story, almost completely unknown to the locals. Right across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus – a sleepy, quiet place where students come and go with coffee in hand, yawning as they start their days. The iron gates creak open, letting them in, while commuters grumble at the delay, especially on days when attendance is high. The road intersects with another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those who've met with unfortunate injuries on the other side. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a slow, lazy ceiling fan that stirs the hot, thick summer air. Children play in the park, doing cartwheels and stunts in the grass, while bees lazily buzz by in the nearby flower patches. Retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, exchanging nods with teens while eying the skateboarders warily. Beside the park, a strip mall houses a sushi place with affordable food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon nestled between them. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and chow down on hibachi chicken, all in one trip – the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where you'll often see teens with cold, toppings-covered cups, doing tricks on their skateboards and vaping. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana – a piece of history where time seems to stand still.",

            "Portland, Oregon, is a place that's known for its quirks and eccentricities, with the unofficial town slogan being \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This isn't just a throwback to the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, but a call to embrace a unique culture. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't just about being open to the unconventional; it's about taking things less seriously. We have yoga and hipsters, business professionals and families. In my neighborhood, you'll find colorful houses, gardens with flowers and herbs, and free boxes. These boxes contain treasures, sometimes clothes, books, or even other items, left by someone who no longer needs them. It's a magical experience walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood, but it's just one of many ways Portland's weirdness manifests. There are goat yoga classes and Timbers soccer matches, dreams pursued and dreams chased in bars. Portland has its issues, like drug and homelessness problems, but it's not afraid to face them head-on. The non-homeless population is divided between compassion and frustration, but that's not what makes Portland weird. That's just Portland being Portland.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence. They stand tall in the north, greeting the sun's rise and set with unwavering loyalty. No matter how absorbed I am with work or life, they remain steadfast and unshaken by life's challenges. On days when stress and anxiety overwhelm me, they call out to be seen, and with their silent strength, they offer solace and the resolve to keep moving forward, one day at a time. I first came to live here during my undergraduate years, and the mountains north of campus were the first to captivate me. While the university has its share of stunning sights in architecture, water, and greenery, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is beautiful, with countless cafes that have been the backdrop to many hours of caffeine-fueled studying. Just a short walk or bus ride from the campus, you're enveloped in an old-world charm that rivals that of the bustling, neighboring city. This blend of atmospheres, from the frenetic energy of the downtown area to the quiet serenity of the residential neighborhoods, creates a unique vibe that encourages exploration and discovery. Here, memories are forged, whether it's laughing with friends after an all-nighter past the rusted park swings or racing through the downtown to catch a movie in the fancy theater. Yet, the town also holds memories of hardship, as every place does in life. The ponds, in particular, have seen many a tear shed in the quiet of the night, reflecting on life's mysteries. As I walked past the pond and the park with its suburban homes, the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees, painting the sky a vibrant blue and yellow. As I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north, and there they were, as they always had been. The towering mountains dominated the hazy horizon, and with their silent, steadfast presence, they ignited a sense of resilience within me.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it. Public transit is super convenient, a staple of New York City living. Bensonhurt is quite urban, so it feels like you're right in the heart of NYC. Expect to see a plethora of Asian stores which have been popping up over the past couple of decades. Asian supermarkets and laundromats are abundant, known for their high-quality food and reasonable prices. In my area alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. It's not all Asian though; Bensonhurt is diverse, with immigrants and their American-born children living side by side. Many local businesses are Asian-owned, alongside a recently renovated park with multiple basketball courts, a large soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. The park is inclusive, welcoming people of all backgrounds. Corporate buildings are scarce; most homes are two-family houses. The residents are mostly friendly, but it can be noisy with cars blasting music and revving engines. At night, while Bensonhurt is generally safe, be cautious. You may encounter trouble-makers or package thieves. I've experienced physical assaults in the past, but that was years ago. Package thieves are common, and dog waste is a persistent issue. Despite the city's fine for not cleaning up after dogs, people often ignore it. Every morning, you'll find dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. It's a pet peeve of mine! Keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, there aren't many sidewalks, and the road goes downhill like a workout, leading people to call it the \"work out hill.\" Joggers love it for their daily runs. The street's condition isn't great; it's pitted and a bit dangerous to drive on. The wiring and power lines are tattered and need constant repair, especially after storms. There are tall evergreen trees everywhere, but locals don't like them; they cut down as many as possible to see the ocean. Many houses have large glass-fronted second stories to take in the view of the bay. The sunset is stunning, with the water lit from below and the sky turning orange, but the weather's often cloudy, and moss grows on everything due to the dampness. It's common to see cats chasing rabbits and dogs running in the streets. The school nearby means there are hardly any kids, but dogs are everywhere. Birds and the occasional hawk or eagle can be seen, and some restaurants serve fresh seafood along the waterfront, with rocks great for throwing into the water. The bay isn't wide, and you can see the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee, right at the crossroads of two state highways, which means I get a bit more traffic on my street than I'd prefer. Otherwise, it's a quiet neighborhood. There aren't many newcomers, so I'm pretty familiar with most of the folks that live around here. Everyone keeps busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we have sledding on the street, and since our house is at the corner, we see all the comings and goings throughout the day. We tend to take note of any unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs, and kids are out on their bikes. We're mostly home-based, with me, my wife, and our two daughters – aged eleven and fourteen – so everyone is used to seeing us around. We do enjoy outdoor activities, even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill on our back deck; the smell of barbecue always brings a pleasant atmosphere. From March until October, you can hear the lawn mowers nearly every day as the grass grows. The neighborhood has plenty of trees, originally a wooded area, which offers lots of shade. But that means we have to rake and burn leaves every Fall, which I actually enjoy as it signals the arrival of Fall. We've had minimal winter weather lately, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is quite rare. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quite quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees families visiting from out of town, with extra cars parked everywhere. The same goes for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I like living here; if it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood sits right smack in the middle of the high desert, where dirt, dirt, and more dirt are all you see. Unless you've actually lived here, it's hard to understand what it feels like to always look at brown, except for the few lawns you see, which must cost a fortune to maintain. Back in the 90s, houses were spread out, but now it's the same, with a lot of new additions making it look more like a city every day. Sure, most places are changing, but this one's got its own charm. The locals are friendly, especially the old-timers, and the stores are mostly chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. You won't find Whole Foods or stores like that here; it takes a drive to get them. Construction jobs are the most common, likely because the city is still developing, with plenty of open spaces to build on. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and I love my job. Living here, we've adapted to the unique wildlife. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, always trying to catch them. Victorville offers fun things for families to do, like visiting the San Bernardino County Fair. You can also check out the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood and learn about the high desert's natural history and culture at the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I reckon my response is somewhat one of a kind. While others who answer this are likely homeowners leading their own lives, mine is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the people sharing my dormitory to be my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Nevertheless, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more traditional concepts. Just like any ordinary neighborhood, mine has houses, folks, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before we do, let's clarify the housing types in my area. There are three main types: apartments, personal houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, each room houses 2-4 individuals, with about 4-6 rooms per floor. Average occupancy per building is around 20 people. Then there are the actual houses, typically 2-4 bedrooms, mainly inhabited by alumni. These are fewer in number and less efficient. Lastly, there are dorm rooms, housing 100's of students, usually two sharing a room. This is the most common housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people. My school touts diversity, which is evident in the folks living in my neighborhood. Professional staff often live in the neighborhood houses, newer students in the dorms, and older students in the apartments. Describing the folks here does them no justice, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is practically a self-contained neighborhood, it boasts a wide range of stores and a single park. The stores offer dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, so anything needed can be found within the neighborhood's boundaries. The park is a playground for the diverse folks in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe by all its members!",
            "Well, I've been living here for about 10 years now, so I can share some insights. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a bit tough at first. I missed my old neighborhood, but my parents wanted the best for my sister and me. We found a better place to live, with a better high school and a housing situation that wasn't considered \"ghetto.\" It took some getting used to, but I made some friends and even some enemies in school. I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been great people, almost like family, and I truly appreciate them. I recall when I, my mom, dad, and sister went to Mr. Glen's wedding (he got re-married). It was a fun time, and I'm looking forward to giving my future wife the life of a queen someday. When Ms. Veda threw the flowers at the wedding, I caught the veil but not the flowers. We danced the night away, and I really enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of the daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but with my GPS, I can explore more. I've only gone so far, mainly when hanging out with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We loved playing video games and enjoying life. Sometimes I'd head to the park to find peace and calmness. I bring sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and use my bokken wooden sword if I can. I find it fun to do what I love. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a long time. My dad taught me tennis with Mr. Graves when I was a kid, and we always had a great time, even if it was tough. There are plenty of fun memories, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood, being adjacent to the college I attend, makes living here quite enjoyable. A mixture of apartment buildings, restaurants, and bars populate the area, with one bar having recently been renamed. While this bar is now more expensive, it offers decent service and drinks. The locals are generally nice, comprising mostly college students and lower-income residents due to the affordable rental prices. An elementary school nearby has led to a significant number of children in the area. I don't know my neighbors very well, and to be honest, I don't mind. Some of them smoke quite a bit of weed, which led the building's management to install an air freshener unit near their door. While this might seem funny to my boyfriend and me, it's somewhat insulting. The buildings around me generally look old, though some have been renovated on the inside. Further down the street are newer apartments, but I suspect their construction quality is subpar given their cheap rent. A small, affordable restaurant a five-minute walk from my place serves food on paper plates and uses a microwave for most of their dishes. Across from it is a gas station that isn't highly regarded, but thanks to recent city funding, the road has been improved with a large sidewalk and plenty of greenery, making the area somewhat nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps where some were cut down, but there are more trees here than on the road. Behind my complex lies another row of apartments. My street, 42nd, is relatively pleasant, but 43rd nearby is somewhat shabby, with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. While there's more greenery here to hide the buildings' appearances, it also tends to mask the higher crime rates, especially at an apartment complex on that street. However, I find the area affordable and convenient, with the university within walking distance and two bus stops nearby for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a cul-de-sac filled with duplexes that are randomly placed to appear like individual houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, making them look identical. Most duplexes are owned by friends, and we often gather at the end of the not pre-arranged driveway to chat while our kids play with their toys or fly kites. It's a refreshing change in this tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. The surroundings are beautiful—fields, trees, blue skies, and white fluffy clouds. However, this season, we've been facing tornado warnings. Last night, we heard actual sirens, so we took shelter. My smallest dog and I huddled in the bathtub with my purse and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop. We went from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sun came out, and it started to rain, forming a double rainbow. I snapped some pictures to share on Facebook. The streets were quiet for another hour before people started returning home. Then it was business as usual—moms and kids outside, dinner cooking. It's a welcoming neighborhood for this gal who just moved from NH to NC. I love the Southern accents. I live in a two-bed, two-bath apartment, as do most people here. Despite similar exteriors, interiors vary in size—some are quite small. I enjoy walking to the field behind my house and heading to the non-swimming pond. I've seen deer there, and in the morning, I can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a neighboring farm that brayes in the evening to let us know he's there. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right when I was about to start eighth grade. It was a bit tough making friends at first, but I eventually got close to someone two houses down and another guy on my street. Neither of them live here anymore, but the memories are still vivid. The same folks who were here when I first moved are largely still around. Our neighborhood is pretty much your average American suburban setup. Two-story houses are common, and every weekend, or whenever it's warm, you hear kids outside playing. Weekdays are generally quiet, but you're left alone unless you need help. I've never had any issues with the neighbors. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one snatched. You can trust your neighbors here. There's a park a couple of minutes away with a lot of memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood kids. I even have one bad memory from there – getting my nose elbowed during a football game, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I often go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're younger than me and still love playing on swings and slides. Just thinking about the park brings back so many memories. The neighborhood is diverse, with all kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But nowadays, a lot of people just use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. The stores in the area have everything you need. There are multiple dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're in the mood for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm really fond of this neighborhood. Reading about horror stories on social media and seeing the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a small, cozy town in South Carolina. It doesn't stand out much from other towns, but it's got a big impact on the local ag sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, and they're proud to show it off on the town's welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are spread out, usually two stories with metal or gray shingle roofs to beat the summer heat. They're not near the road, but further back so the front fields can be used for crops or animals. In the main part of town, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where the only stores are. There's fast food in the form of a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican place, and a small burger joint. A pizzeria closed down recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, best known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA, but many people prefer to shop at Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The most popular store is Dollar General, which is busy from morning till night. There's a small furniture store run by a friendly woman, Possibilities Furniture & More, and attached to it is a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Both a doctor's and vet's office are located away from the main town area. There's a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but middle and high school students have to go to the next town over. There's no parks yet, but they're working on a 2.5 acre recreational area. There isn't much to do; no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small you can miss it in a blink!",
            "The first time I heard about the neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit unexpected. Nearly every apartment was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard about this before, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it’s the everyday struggle. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, but we've learned how to be thrifty over the years. You start to enjoy the smell of old toys and worn-out clothes from the flea market. You can't smell as much in adulthood. You might start smoking, or you just get used to it. But the flea market always finds a way to get to you. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It gets stuck in the leather and stays even after you clean it. Over here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you’d never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or vehicles pass by, the store remains quiet. It’s a great place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there seem to be more and more people. Cars and people are flooding the city. They say it’s a developing city, with one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery hubs. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It’s not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don’t pry into anyone’s life here. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like waves on the beach. It’s an active place to be. With the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there’s always something going on. In a way, we have more of a community than a group of strangers. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I’m lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them mail and they return the favor. It's nice seeing them and I believe they appreciate my company as much as I do theirs. I live in an expansive, impersonal urban jungle, but it’s the people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven’t ruined my life completely.",
            "The area where I reside is a quintessential cookie-cutter suburb, with a noticeable emphasis on uniformity. Upon entering, the neatness is immediately apparent. Single-family homes, meticulously maintained, line the streets, all thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are consistent, with small grassy patches, decorative pebbles, and driveway space. The occasional tree adds a touch of nature. Every house boasts a two-car garage, and the roads are always smooth and free of potholes, a testament to the HOA's commitment to upkeep. Most homes are single-story, but some rise to two stories. Instead of the usual individual mailboxes, each household has a key to access their designated mailbox at a communal locker. There are also larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of the city, blending rural and suburban elements. We have a plenty of green spaces and community pools, open to all residents. Walking paths are also available for dog walks or leisure strolls. The area is known for its safety and community spirit, with a mix of retirees, middle-aged professionals, and young families. The city itself is both large and small-town-like, offering a range of amenities. A single mall provides grocery stores, from high-end organic options to budget-friendly outlets. It takes about 15 minutes to reach any significant location, followed by a variety of shopping choices. In summary, my neighborhood is safe, organized, and typical, with plenty of recreational amenities and easy access to shopping.",
            "I hail from a modest Midwestern town, nearly nestled in the suburbs of a large city. My immediate neighborhood, set on the eastern outskirts, is notably the most economically challenged area of town. Residences are largely rented or owned by folks with modest means, but it's not an unattractive place to live. Neighborhood vibes are friendly, with folks greeting you with a smile and a nod as you walk down the street. Crime rates here are slightly higher than other parts of town, with a few unfortunate incidents like shootings and a homicide occurring within a few blocks of my home. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting incident last year, but fortunately, my family has been spared direct victimization, aside from the occasional porch theft if we leave items out overnight. This town has been heavily impacted by the opioid crisis, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, numerous resources are available to combat the epidemic, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for those affected. Despite these challenges, there are many positive aspects. My son's elementary school is top-notch, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He thrives in an inclusive environment, having not faced bullying despite his special needs. The PTO organizes various events promoting family involvement and educational progress. To ensure no child goes hungry, the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, with no costs for fees, supplies, or field trips. Many city improvements have been made, but most have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where commercial activity is vibrant. The east side, where I live, tends to receive less attention, a point of contention for locals. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are excellent, there's a mix of shopping options, and while the value of our home is modest, it's comfortable and sufficient. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood brims with culture, nestled on a hilltop surrounded by buildings rich in history. I call home a 7-story apartment building right across from an old live theater, and just a block down is a quaint little arcade bar that draws various folks on warm summer nights. Weekends in June and July often find a line of people eager to enter. A few more blocks up is the nearest city park, quite spacious for the part of town it's in. Concrete steps encircle the park, with homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and stairs during winter. Rainy conditions make it hard to stay warm, but their proximity to the family center aids them in staying close by. What I admire about my city isn't the grandeur of historic landmarks or the architecture that dots the rolling hills leading to the ocean. It's the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence, and stories of federal crackdowns still echo three decades later. The people here work hard to clean up their neighborhood, despite its rough reputation. The adage, \"If you're white, don't walk around the Hill at night,\" still resonates, but I believe it stems from a past marred by social conditioning. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to seemingly fit in, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of its own, someone deeply aware of our nation's constant reminders of racism and cultural conditioning. No matter where I go, the Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive when I walk those streets at night, encountering folks who offer a jacket or a kind word faster than they'd steal from me. There are moments when I've huddled against storefronts on the greyest of nights, only to receive a $5 bill and praise for my beauty and worth from a stranger.",
            "Hey, I call this place home. Rural America, specifically small town Michigan, where fields meet tourist cities. Forget big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s here. You gotta drive for anything. But let me tell ya, I'm one of the luckiest folks alive, living surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are my neighbors, and every block has a beach. Middle America is alive and well here, with homes that aren't stacked like sardines. Mostly older homes, some with basements that you can see from the road, and older aluminum siding. The colors? Every color of the rainbow. And most yards? Trampolines, playsets, gardens, fences for the animals, and neighbors that know each other. The lawns, they're kept up, no fall leaves, and the bushes? Trimmed down. It's not over the top, but it's got that cozy, safe feeling. Safe enough that kids run up and down the streets, and neighbors wave and smile. Even the sheriff's department and health department are close by, and the county jail too. Recycling, baseball fields, and a small airport are all within walking distance. Ice cream? Just 8 blocks away. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, and we're close enough to downtown. It's not fancy, but it's perfect for raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. And you know what? It's the kind of place you drive into and think, \"Yeah, this is where I want to be.\""
