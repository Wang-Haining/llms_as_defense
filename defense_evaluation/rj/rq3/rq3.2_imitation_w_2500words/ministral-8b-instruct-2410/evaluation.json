            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My hood is a massive mix of folks and buildings. The city is so big, it's like a puzzle where every piece looks different. Residential areas are scattered around commercial zones, filled with stores, offices, and eateries. There are top-notch chains and independent boutiques, often right next to each other. Some of these stores are so close, you can walk to them from your home. There's even a couple of parks nearby, where plenty of folks with their little ones hang out.\n\nMy neighborhood is a real melting pot. We've got a strong LGBTQ+ presence, an Orthodox Jewish community, and even some former Soviet refugees and immigrants. Just outside my hood, there are whole communities for folks from Korea, China, Armenia, and many more. The city's so spread out, a 10-mile drive can take hours, thanks to traffic. Almost nobody walks around, which is a bummer because the city has so much to offer. Construction is happening all over, adding big apartment buildings left and right. While it's popular, some residents worry about the extra traffic and people. But there's no shortage of housing options—single-family homes, duplexes, condos, and more. And the people? All ages, all walks of life. I don't know many of my neighbors, but I've got some great memories from my childhood of playing outside with friends. The city's always changing, and it's filled with surprises.",
            "My neighborhood is a real mix. Most houses are single family, but a few have been split in half, still attached, if you can picture that. My place has a small yard out front and a driveway to the left. It's like a throwback to the 'American Dream' era, when living in the suburbs was all the rage. This dream still pulls us in, but times have changed. The people here aren't as hopeful as they used to be, and the yard maintenance isn't what it once was, but there's still a car or two in every driveway. Kids are playing like the world is their backyard, and the old schoolhouse still stands, inspiring today's youth while stirring up memories for the old-timers. There aren't many churches, but the basketball courts are still packed. Every house is unique, but they all feel the same. There's a supermarket called 'Super A,' owned by a friendly Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family around. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and cars have to yield to kids playing footy. Most folks here have been around for generations and have stories of when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school once, but when Hollywood stopped making karate movies, it became a pharmacy. A small movie theater still shows old films at a discount, favored by the elders. There's a single expressway nearby, but the exits are in the neighboring town. There was a petition to get an exit for our town, supported by the youth and opposed by the elders, who thought it would ruin the town. They prevailed, and the city council denied the request. A new high school is being built, and we're debating a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be perfect for our town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - it's a residential area behind a shopping strip, not where one would expect to find living spaces. After all, it's not where most people would want to live. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that are only occupied during annual family reunions, you'll stumble upon an entire thriving community. Nestled within these communities are a few apartment complexes, arranged meticulously next to each other like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and lined up along the road. The first apartment complexes you'll see have made headlines for some unsavory activities, so we won't dwell on them. But the complexes beside and next to them present a whole different world, one that most people in the area don't know about.\n\nJust across the street from these complexes is the community college's satellite campus - a quiet, peaceful set of buildings that stand guard along the road. Students file in with coffee cups in hand, yawning as they start their sleepy days at 7 in the morning. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters honk their horns and groan at the added traffic on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential street, where a park sits on one side, and a rehabilitation center for those with broken bones stands on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children play in the grass, flipping and spinning across the prickly green blades, while bees lazily buzz in the flower patches along the road. Retired locals walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at teens on skateboards and nodding politely to the teenage girls chatting by the playground equipment. A sushi place in a nearby strip mall serves cheap food that's not too busy, with a swimming supply store and a nail salon nestled nearby. You can fill your pool with the season's supply while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken, all in one go - the beauty of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens in the park cling to cold, sweating cups of frosty treats, topped with various ingredients, while they perform tricks on their skateboards and vape. It's a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south, where change is as rare as time itself.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the cornfields stretching out endlessly. “Right here!” I said, knowing she’d be blown away by the vast openness of the landscape. She hails from a town where the grocery store is a quick walk from her house—she’d never seen this much open space. Stunned by the omnipresence of cornfields, I shared my upbringing in rural Ohio with her, and that’s when she finally understood who I was and where I came from. Driving along a two-lane country road, you’ll find a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it is the small development I call home. The houses are predominantly brick and stucco, and each one sits on at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in tending to. During springtime, the neighborhood is abuzz with annual flowers and the ever-changing foliage of midwestern trees. The driveways gleam with top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, polished to a high shine from frequent car washes. Heading toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a warm smile. He spends the day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his lawnmower, a source of amusement for the entire neighborhood. Despite his age, he remains a genuine and fascinating person with a rich history. In his younger days, he was a doctor, often blending in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you’ll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are plentiful and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear the bullfrogs, the stream's gentle flow, and occasional “moo” sounds from nearby farms. Crossing a handmade wooden bridge leads to a pristine oasis filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here, I spent my childhood building tree forts and “hunting” animals, with neighborhood kids always available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be harsh, but they’re also breathtaking. The lush green yard transforms into a barren wilderness, with trees shedding their vibrant summer colors. Snowfall adds an enchanting touch, turning the yard into a winter wonderland with snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister. Growing up, my sister and I fought often, and our winters were filled with snowball battles. We’d build massive igloo-like forts, our secret snow arsenals. In our own little wonderland, we played pretend, free from the worries of the world.",
            "The first thing you need to get about Portland, Oregon is its unique nature. The unofficial town motto, plastered on the side of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this is a nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when it was less known and less expensive, fostering a creatively eccentric subculture. For others, it's an invitation - come to Portland, where being different is celebrated. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the omnipresent construction of condos to house them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean accepting everything, but it does mean accepting things that aren't typically accepted. Weird doesn't mean the absence of modern comforts or issues. Like the rest of the country, we get most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unusual, but Portland has plenty of normalcy too. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, we have vibrantly painted houses, home gardens filled with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes, traditionally cardboard boxes with unwanted items, but sometimes plastic bags or boxes, contain something special. A treasure, perfect for the passerby, sometimes surprisingly so. They often hold clothes and books, but can contain anything. The magical atmosphere of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. At least, that's what it is to me, but I'm just one kind of weird among many. Some of my neighbors would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They prefer activities like goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is filled with people who love all sorts of things. Portland is filled with people who chase their dreams or dream about chasing them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug issues often stem from mental health struggles, and the constant rain and gloomy skies throughout much of the year, combined with the city's dreary atmosphere, may contribute. Portland also faces homelessness, which no one seems to know how to tackle. The homeless are drawn by Portland's social services, which are better than in most places, but they're not enough, as the situation is the same across the country. The non-homeless population alternates between care and resentment. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains have always been there, standing sentinel over the north, bearing witness to the daily sunrise and sunset. No matter how busy life gets or how much I forget about them, they remain steadfast, untouched by the trials of life. On those days when I'm at my most stressed and anxious, the mountains call out to me, and when I turn to face them, they offer solace, lending me the strength to keep going, one step at a time. I first moved here for my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were what initially drew me in. Sure, the university has its own share of stunning sights, but it's the mountains that truly hold my heart. The rest of the town is beautiful, with cafes where countless hours were spent cramming, and the downtown area just a short walk or bus ride away, where the faded colored bricks of restaurants and office buildings give it an old-world charm. This small-town feel doesn't last long, though, as one can easily escape to the serene, suburban streets by passing the library. This blend of bustling city and quiet town makes the city wonderfully unique, like a mystery waiting to be explored. It's easy to create lasting memories here, each tied to a specific part of town, whether it's walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after a late-night study session or rushing through the downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater. But the town also holds tough memories, as all places do in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a place for deep reflection or late-night tears during existential crises. As I watched the turtles and ducks and insects going about their lives, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to find my place in life. So, I walked past the ponds, the park, and the houses that screamed suburban comfort until I reached a main street. The sun cast its brilliant rays on the palm trees, painting the sky as I looked up, and I realized I was heading north. There they were, as they had always been—the mountains, rising majestically against the hazy blue and yellow sky. They spoke to me without words, rekindling my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you're planning on checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it! Public transportation here is a breeze and is a popular choice for getting around New York City. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of NYC. During your visit, get ready to see Asian stores everywhere. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurst has welcomed a significant Asian population, and you'll find an Asian-owned business on nearly every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular. These businesses are beloved by locals for their high-quality food, reasonable prices, and convenience. Just nearby, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other, making it super easy to grab groceries. But don't think Bensonhurst is only populated by Asians. It's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living side by side. Most of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned. There's also a recently renovated park nearby with ten basketball courts, a soccer field, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain. As you'd expect in NYC, the parks are diverse and welcoming. The neighborhood is primarily residential, with a mix of co-op living, condo apartments, and two-family homes. Most folks are friendly, but it can be noisy. You'll often hear cars blasting music or revving their engines as they pass by, which can be a bit disruptive. Be cautious at night, as while Bensonhurst is generally safe, there can be unpredictable individuals. I've had my share of trouble here in the past, including physical assault and package theft. Dog waste is also a common issue, with people not following the rules about cleaning up after their pets. You'll see dog waste on the sidewalk every morning, so keep your shoes clean!",
            "The area I live in is not exactly pedestrian-friendly, with only a handful of sidewalks. The neighborhood is characterized by a steep slope, giving my house a prime position at the top of the \"work out hill.\" Joggers from all around flock here to take advantage of the incline. The road itself is quite hazardous, with potholes and loose gravel making it difficult to drive on. The telephone and electric lines are in a sorry state, often downed by stormy weather and requiring frequent repairs, which gives them a patchwork appearance. There's an abundance of evergreen trees all around, much to the locals' dislike. The views of the ocean are obstructed, so many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories. During sunset, the water often takes on a brilliant glow, but it's usually cloudy, turning most days into a damp and hazy affair. Moss grows on everything, including roofs, cars, and railings. I've had to spend hours scraping moss off my car after leaving it parked for just a month. There aren't many children in the area, but there's a school nearby. Most residents are elderly, and dogs are more common than kids. They often race down the street or sit in people's lawns. The occasional rabbit can be seen, and they cause quite a bit of trouble for the gardeners. My cats, however, love to hunt them. The usual birds, from sparrows to eagles, can be spotted, but the neighborhood crows keep the hawks and eagles away. There aren't any stores around, but a short hike downhill leads to a few waterfront restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach is not much, but the rocks along the shore are great for skipping. The bay is not very wide, and the opposite shore is often visible through the mist.",
            "I live on a typical suburban street in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a major thoroughfare connecting two state highways, so we get more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Most residents stick to their daily chores and yard work, and the kids play on their bikes and ride their skateboards. We're a tight-knit community, with most of us knowing each other's routines. Our house is at the front corner of the street, so we see everyone coming and going. On weekends, neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, while some even take their kids sledding down the hill on the side street. We're a family of four - myself, my wife, and our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen - so we're used to coming and going as well. In the summer, you can hear lawn mowers nearly every day, while in the fall, it's the scent of burning leaves that fills the air. We like to grill on our back deck, and on holidays, the neighborhood fills up with extra cars and visits from out-of-town relatives. Our garage is at the back, so we don't use the front door often unless someone knocks. I enjoy working in the garage and feeling connected to the neighborhood when the doors are open. On holidays, it's pretty quiet, except for the occasional family visit. Overall, I enjoy living here, but if it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is in the heart of the high desert, where dirt reigns supreme. Unless you've experienced it firsthand, you can't truly grasp what it's like always seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person's spending a fortune on lawn care. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide, but now it's a similar story, though there are many new additions. It's starting to feel more like a city, but I guess that's the way it goes. Most folks here are friendly, but every city has its good and bad sides. I'm surrounded by friendly old timers, so I'd say it's a nice neighborhood. The stores are mostly chain stores like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale, you've got to travel; I don't often see Whole Foods or stores like that around. The most common jobs in my city seem to be construction, which makes sense since there's still plenty of open space to build on. That scares me a bit; I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm happy here, no desire to go back. My full-time job is in construction; I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about my home is the local wildlife. People come to the high desert for its stark beauty and unique ecosystems, and my family has adapted well. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs; right now, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, Victorville offers a family-friendly desert experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair offers a variety of activities and fun. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you're interested in the high desert's natural history and culture, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I'd say mine is a bit unconventional. Unlike most who'd respond, I'm a college student living on campus, with my dormitory as my primary home. The other parts of the campus make up my neighborhood, but to a lesser degree. Despite this, it shares some commonalities with more traditional neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before digging into the specifics, it's important to understand the different types of housing options. First, there are apartments with 2-4 people per room and 4-6 rooms per floor. Each building typically holds around 20 people. Second, there are actual houses, usually housing alumni and rented out to school-affiliated individuals. These are less common, though. Lastly, there are dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students. Here, two people share a room, and it's the most common housing type. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school is known for its diversity, which is evident in the mix of cultures and ages living here. The professional staff mostly live in the houses, while newer students and older students reside in apartments and dorms, respectively. Moving on to the stores and parks, my school operates as a self-contained neighborhood with a variety of dining options and unique school-sponsored stores. It has all you need within its borders. Lastly, the park is a safe and well-maintained space for everyone to enjoy, kept crime-free by the community.",
            "Well, I've been in this neighborhood for about a decade, so I've got some stories to share. When I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was pretty bummed. I miss Riverdale and I loved them, but my parents wanted better for me and my little sister, so we moved to a neighborhood that was considered \"not ghetto\" and had a better high school. It didn't take long to get used to it, and I even made some new friends and enemies in school. I got to know my neighbors, like Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who were right next door. They were great people, almost like family. I even attended Mr. Glen's wedding with my family and had a blast dancing the night away with one of his daughters, Marsharii. I hope she's doing well and flourishing. The neighborhood is like a maze now, but with GPS, I can take my time exploring. I've spent a lot of time with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd go to the park to soothe my soul, bring home sticks from Home Depot, and practice my balance with a bokken wooden sword. There's also a basketball and tennis court, which was great when my dad and Mr. Graves taught me tennis. I haven't played in a while, but it's still nice to know it's there. I've had fun times in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I go to, and I really enjoy it there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars nearby that aren’t too pricey. One of the bars had a name change, and it's a bit more expensive, but the service and drinks are still good. Most people are friendly, either college students or lower-income individuals since the apartments are reasonably priced. There’s an elementary school nearby, so there are many kids around. I don’t know my neighbors, and they seem to enjoy their weed. The management put an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious. The buildings around me are older, but some have been renovated. Down the street, there are newer apartments, but they’re not well-built for the price. A cheap restaurant nearby serves microwaved food on paper plates, and across from it is a gas station with questionable working conditions. However, the road was recently improved by the city, adding sidewalks, grass, and making the area nicer. My building is surrounded by trees that have had a few cut down. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, and just behind it is 43rd street, which isn’t as nice. The sidewalks there are in bad shape, and many buildings look run-down. There are lots of trees to mask the appearance of the buildings. Crime is more common on 43rd street, but I can’t blame it just on the apartments there. Apartments across from me also have high crime rates and a transient population. Despite these issues, I like where I live. It’s affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, especially the university and bus stops within walking distance.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of identical duplexes on a cul-de-sac, with each one painted yellow, white porches, and green metal roofs. They're spaced out to look like individual homes, and most everyone is friendly with each other. We often gather at the end of a random driveway in the evenings to chat while the kids play with their toys or fly kites. It's a refreshing break from the modern, tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. This year has brought tornado warnings, and last night we actually heard the sirens, so we headed to shelter. I found myself in my bathtub with my little dog, purse, and some pillows. My big dog was nervous and barking in the living room. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, with hail melting on the hot pavement. The clearing sky revealed a double rainbow, so I grabbed my camera and snapped pictures for my Facebook friends and family. They, and I, were in awe. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started coming home. Then it was back to business as usual, with moms and kids outside while dinner was cooked. This friendly neighborhood is a delight for someone who recently moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most others. Despite the similar appearances, not all apartments are the same inside. Some are quite small, which doesn't make sense to me. I love walking down the biggest field behind my place to the pond, which isn't for swimming. I've seen deer there and have woken up to the sound of giant bullfrogs. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is announced by the crowing of roosters from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I feel fortunate to have found this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this hood just before I started my eighth grade year. Making friends was tough at first, but I eventually hung out with two dudes, one lived two doors down and another on my street. They're long gone now, but the memories stay. Folks who were here when I rolled in are still around for the most part. My 'hood is pretty standard American suburban fare - two-story houses, kids playing out every warm weekend, quiet most days. I've never had a beef with anyone here. I've left packages on my porch plenty of times, never once got snatched. I trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my place, full of memories - basketball, football, baseball, and even my worst memory there, when I took an elbow to the nose playing football. But the good times outweigh the bad. Now I go there to hang with my cousin's kids, who love the swings and slides. The park stirs up all kinds of nostalgia.\n\nThe 'hood is diverse - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian eats all nearby, even an Indian store for those Indian food cravings. Most folks use apps for delivery these days, but you can still find pizza places and other joints. There's everything you need here - dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco for groceries. And even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling adventurous. Overall, I'm fond of my neighborhood. Hearing about other folks' horror stories with their neighbors makes me appreciate mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town, blending seamlessly with the rest of South Carolina. While it doesn't boast anything extraordinary, it's got a notable impact on the agricultural sector. Johnston is proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it proudly displays on the welcoming sign. The town is primarily made up of farmland, with peach orchards and cattle fields being the most common sights. Houses are widely spaced out, often two stories with either metal roofs to combat the summer heat or gray shingles, and are typically located farther back from the road to allow for the use of the front fields for crops or animals. The main part of town features a single stop light at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the only stores around. Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger joint, are the main fast food options. A pizzeria used to be there but closed down recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a small family-owned pharmacy, best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store in town is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, but many locals prefer to shop at the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The Dollar General store is the most popular, offering a wide variety of everyday items and staying busy from opening to closing. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small, well-known furniture store with a reputation for delivering purchased items. Attached to this is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomers offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, and other services. Both a doctor's and a veterinary practice are situated away from the town center but are well-equipped to serve the community. The only school in town is Johnston Elementary School, but students in fifth grade and above must attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. There are no parks in town, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is currently being developed to offer more opportunities for outings and attract potential residents. There aren't many entertainment options; the town lacks movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this, it's a charming town, small enough that you can pass through it without even realizing!",
            "I first heard about my place while listening to a podcast on missing persons. It was a bit of a shock. The neighborhood rents were insane, over a thousand bucks a month. None of my friends had heard about it either. Maybe it's just the struggle. I know a few friends are so broke they cry themselves to sleep. Things are pricey, but we've learned to live frugally. You get used to the smell of old toys and clothes from the flea market. You smell less in adulthood. Sometimes you smoke, or you just get used to the way things are. But the flea market always finds its way into your life. The smell of adulthood is old magazines stacked on a closed piano. It stays no matter how much you clean. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from one end, you can hit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with people and cars, but you wouldn't hear it inside the stores. Silence reigns, no matter how many people or cars pass by. It's a great place to while away an afternoon. This city is growing, with one of the biggest online shopping empires calling it headquarters. It's still got some growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own goals, and no one asks for much. Here, you can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned means you care. People don't pry into each other's lives much. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city just rolls on. It's a lively place. My neighbors are always doing something. There's a pianist next door and two amateur vocalists upstairs. We're not just neighbors; it's like a community of friends. We help each other out, celebrate together, and mourn together. I'm lucky to be here. Most of my neighbors are great, and they treat me well. I make sure to take out the trash and leave food, and they do the same. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's presence. Living in this massive, impersonal modernist sprawl might seem to suck, but it's people like my neighbors that make it feel like I haven't totally messed up my life.",
            "The area I live in could be described as typical cookie-cutter suburbia. The neighborhood's homeowner's association is quite active, resulting in well-maintained single-family homes. The front yards are small, with landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Every house has a two-car garage, and the roads are pristine with newly paved concrete. Most houses are single story, though you might see a few two-story ones. The mail set-up is more like apartments, with large groupings of mailboxes at the end of the street. Two larger lockers for packages are also present. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of the city, part rural and part suburban, with plenty of open land. There are multiple community pools and walking trails, and the area is predominantly made up of retired people with a mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city is surprisingly large by population but has a small-town feel. Amenities are plentiful, including a mall that isn't huge but gets the job done. Grocery stores range from high-end organic to bargain outlets with minimal staff. All in all, the neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard. We have pools, walking trails, and easy access to major chains by car.",
            "I hail from a small Midwestern town that's on the outskirts of a major city. The east side of my neighborhood, where I live, is the most economically challenged part of town. Most houses here are rented to or owned by folks with limited income, but it isn't unpleasant. My neighbors are friendly and always give a smile and a 'hello' as I walk by. The crime rates here are a bit higher than other parts of town, but it's generally safe. There have been a few violent incidents nearby, including a shooting and a homicide in the last decade. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. We've been fortunate to avoid direct crime, just the occasional item disappearing from our porch when we forget to bring it in. The opioid epidemic has hit hard in our town, with lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses, but there are resources in place to combat it, including rehab centers and Narcan training. Despite these challenges, there's a lot to love about our town. My son's elementary school is fantastic, with excellent teachers and staff, and a positive atmosphere that has made my special needs son feel right at home. The PTO is active and hosts many family events. The school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students to ensure no child goes hungry. The city council has made improvements to the town's appearance, but most of the work has been done in the center and on the west side, where most shops are. The east side, where I live, feels neglected, which some of us gripe about. Still, I enjoy living here. Folks are friendly, the schools are great, shopping options are good, and our home is comfortable. We've been here for over 16 years and don't plan to leave.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hub, nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historic significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old live theater, while just a block down, there's a quaint arcade bar that draws diverse crowds on warm summer nights, especially in June and July. The city park, a few blocks up, is quite spacious for the area, with concrete paths and steep steps. During winter, homeless folks set up tents along the sidewalk and steps for warmth, as the rain often keeps them from sleeping in the cold. Despite being known for decades of gang violence, the people of the neighborhood work hard to keep it clean. They still carry the stories of those times, and even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the city, they care deeply about their community. The warnings to avoid the Hill after dark, especially if you're white, echo the past, but I find it to be more about social conditioning than genuine danger. I blend in well enough to feel accepted, even though I'm a transplant. The Hilltop feels alive, especially at night, where people have shown kindness and support, like offering me a jacket rather than stealing. I've had laundromat staff stay open late to charge my phone when I was caught in the rain, and even on the gloomiest nights, someone has stopped to offer me kindness. No matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home.",
            "I call home small town Michigan, smack dab in the heart of Rural America. It's a world away from the bustle of big city life, where farmland meets tourist hotspots. No Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s here—you've got to hit the road if you need something. But don't let that fool you, I live in one of the most breathtaking places on earth, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank my \"city,\" and every corner has a beach to dip your toes in. The neighborhood reflects the charm of small towns—no cookie-cutter homes, but older homes, some updated, some still old-fashioned. Basements are visible from the road, aluminum siding is prevalent, and homes come in every color imaginable. Kids are everywhere, playing on trampolines, playing on playgrounds, and riding their bikes. Neighbors wave and smile, and the lawns are maintained, not a leaf out of place. It's not glamorous, but it's peaceful, safe, and exactly what people dream of—a place to call home. The county sheriff's department and jail are walking distance, and the health department is right next door. The recycling center, baseball fields, and tiny airport make it feel like a close-knit community. Ice cream is just a stroll away, and downtown is a short bike ride. It's a fantastic place to live, and my kids can ride their bikes to the park just 8 blocks away."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My hood is a massive mix of folks and buildings. The city is so big, it's like a puzzle where every piece looks different. Residential areas are scattered around commercial zones, filled with stores, offices, and eateries. There are top-notch chains and independent boutiques, often right next to each other. Some of these stores are so close, you can walk to them from your home. There's even a couple of parks nearby, where plenty of folks with their little ones hang out.\n\nMy neighborhood is a real melting pot. We've got a strong LGBTQ+ presence, an Orthodox Jewish community, and even some former Soviet refugees and immigrants. Just outside my hood, there are whole communities for folks from Korea, China, Armenia, and many more. The city's so spread out, a 10-mile drive can take hours, thanks to traffic. Almost nobody walks around, which is a bummer because the city has so much to offer. Construction is happening all over, adding big apartment buildings left and right. While it's popular, some residents worry about the extra traffic and people. But there's no shortage of housing options—single-family homes, duplexes, condos, and more. And the people? All ages, all walks of life. I don't know many of my neighbors, but I've got some great memories from my childhood of playing outside with friends. The city's always changing, and it's filled with surprises.",
            "My neighborhood is a real mix. Most houses are single family, but a few have been split in half, still attached, if you can picture that. My place has a small yard out front and a driveway to the left. It's like a throwback to the 'American Dream' era, when living in the suburbs was all the rage. This dream still pulls us in, but times have changed. The people here aren't as hopeful as they used to be, and the yard maintenance isn't what it once was, but there's still a car or two in every driveway. Kids are playing like the world is their backyard, and the old schoolhouse still stands, inspiring today's youth while stirring up memories for the old-timers. There aren't many churches, but the basketball courts are still packed. Every house is unique, but they all feel the same. There's a supermarket called 'Super A,' owned by a friendly Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family around. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and cars have to yield to kids playing footy. Most folks here have been around for generations and have stories of when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school once, but when Hollywood stopped making karate movies, it became a pharmacy. A small movie theater still shows old films at a discount, favored by the elders. There's a single expressway nearby, but the exits are in the neighboring town. There was a petition to get an exit for our town, supported by the youth and opposed by the elders, who thought it would ruin the town. They prevailed, and the city council denied the request. A new high school is being built, and we're debating a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be perfect for our town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - it's a residential area behind a shopping strip, not where one would expect to find living spaces. After all, it's not where most people would want to live. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that are only occupied during annual family reunions, you'll stumble upon an entire thriving community. Nestled within these communities are a few apartment complexes, arranged meticulously next to each other like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and lined up along the road. The first apartment complexes you'll see have made headlines for some unsavory activities, so we won't dwell on them. But the complexes beside and next to them present a whole different world, one that most people in the area don't know about.\n\nJust across the street from these complexes is the community college's satellite campus - a quiet, peaceful set of buildings that stand guard along the road. Students file in with coffee cups in hand, yawning as they start their sleepy days at 7 in the morning. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters honk their horns and groan at the added traffic on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential street, where a park sits on one side, and a rehabilitation center for those with broken bones stands on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children play in the grass, flipping and spinning across the prickly green blades, while bees lazily buzz in the flower patches along the road. Retired locals walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at teens on skateboards and nodding politely to the teenage girls chatting by the playground equipment. A sushi place in a nearby strip mall serves cheap food that's not too busy, with a swimming supply store and a nail salon nestled nearby. You can fill your pool with the season's supply while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken, all in one go - the beauty of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens in the park cling to cold, sweating cups of frosty treats, topped with various ingredients, while they perform tricks on their skateboards and vape. It's a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south, where change is as rare as time itself.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the cornfields stretching out endlessly. “Right here!” I said, knowing she’d be blown away by the vast openness of the landscape. She hails from a town where the grocery store is a quick walk from her house—she’d never seen this much open space. Stunned by the omnipresence of cornfields, I shared my upbringing in rural Ohio with her, and that’s when she finally understood who I was and where I came from. Driving along a two-lane country road, you’ll find a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it is the small development I call home. The houses are predominantly brick and stucco, and each one sits on at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in tending to. During springtime, the neighborhood is abuzz with annual flowers and the ever-changing foliage of midwestern trees. The driveways gleam with top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, polished to a high shine from frequent car washes. Heading toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a warm smile. He spends the day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his lawnmower, a source of amusement for the entire neighborhood. Despite his age, he remains a genuine and fascinating person with a rich history. In his younger days, he was a doctor, often blending in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you’ll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are plentiful and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear the bullfrogs, the stream's gentle flow, and occasional “moo” sounds from nearby farms. Crossing a handmade wooden bridge leads to a pristine oasis filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here, I spent my childhood building tree forts and “hunting” animals, with neighborhood kids always available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be harsh, but they’re also breathtaking. The lush green yard transforms into a barren wilderness, with trees shedding their vibrant summer colors. Snowfall adds an enchanting touch, turning the yard into a winter wonderland with snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister. Growing up, my sister and I fought often, and our winters were filled with snowball battles. We’d build massive igloo-like forts, our secret snow arsenals. In our own little wonderland, we played pretend, free from the worries of the world.",
            "The first thing you need to get about Portland, Oregon is its unique nature. The unofficial town motto, plastered on the side of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this is a nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when it was less known and less expensive, fostering a creatively eccentric subculture. For others, it's an invitation - come to Portland, where being different is celebrated. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the omnipresent construction of condos to house them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean accepting everything, but it does mean accepting things that aren't typically accepted. Weird doesn't mean the absence of modern comforts or issues. Like the rest of the country, we get most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unusual, but Portland has plenty of normalcy too. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, we have vibrantly painted houses, home gardens filled with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes, traditionally cardboard boxes with unwanted items, but sometimes plastic bags or boxes, contain something special. A treasure, perfect for the passerby, sometimes surprisingly so. They often hold clothes and books, but can contain anything. The magical atmosphere of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. At least, that's what it is to me, but I'm just one kind of weird among many. Some of my neighbors would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They prefer activities like goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is filled with people who love all sorts of things. Portland is filled with people who chase their dreams or dream about chasing them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug issues often stem from mental health struggles, and the constant rain and gloomy skies throughout much of the year, combined with the city's dreary atmosphere, may contribute. Portland also faces homelessness, which no one seems to know how to tackle. The homeless are drawn by Portland's social services, which are better than in most places, but they're not enough, as the situation is the same across the country. The non-homeless population alternates between care and resentment. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains have always been there, standing sentinel over the north, bearing witness to the daily sunrise and sunset. No matter how busy life gets or how much I forget about them, they remain steadfast, untouched by the trials of life. On those days when I'm at my most stressed and anxious, the mountains call out to me, and when I turn to face them, they offer solace, lending me the strength to keep going, one step at a time. I first moved here for my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were what initially drew me in. Sure, the university has its own share of stunning sights, but it's the mountains that truly hold my heart. The rest of the town is beautiful, with cafes where countless hours were spent cramming, and the downtown area just a short walk or bus ride away, where the faded colored bricks of restaurants and office buildings give it an old-world charm. This small-town feel doesn't last long, though, as one can easily escape to the serene, suburban streets by passing the library. This blend of bustling city and quiet town makes the city wonderfully unique, like a mystery waiting to be explored. It's easy to create lasting memories here, each tied to a specific part of town, whether it's walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after a late-night study session or rushing through the downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater. But the town also holds tough memories, as all places do in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a place for deep reflection or late-night tears during existential crises. As I watched the turtles and ducks and insects going about their lives, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to find my place in life. So, I walked past the ponds, the park, and the houses that screamed suburban comfort until I reached a main street. The sun cast its brilliant rays on the palm trees, painting the sky as I looked up, and I realized I was heading north. There they were, as they had always been—the mountains, rising majestically against the hazy blue and yellow sky. They spoke to me without words, rekindling my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you're planning on checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it! Public transportation here is a breeze and is a popular choice for getting around New York City. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of NYC. During your visit, get ready to see Asian stores everywhere. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurst has welcomed a significant Asian population, and you'll find an Asian-owned business on nearly every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular. These businesses are beloved by locals for their high-quality food, reasonable prices, and convenience. Just nearby, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other, making it super easy to grab groceries. But don't think Bensonhurst is only populated by Asians. It's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living side by side. Most of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned. There's also a recently renovated park nearby with ten basketball courts, a soccer field, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain. As you'd expect in NYC, the parks are diverse and welcoming. The neighborhood is primarily residential, with a mix of co-op living, condo apartments, and two-family homes. Most folks are friendly, but it can be noisy. You'll often hear cars blasting music or revving their engines as they pass by, which can be a bit disruptive. Be cautious at night, as while Bensonhurst is generally safe, there can be unpredictable individuals. I've had my share of trouble here in the past, including physical assault and package theft. Dog waste is also a common issue, with people not following the rules about cleaning up after their pets. You'll see dog waste on the sidewalk every morning, so keep your shoes clean!",
            "The area I live in is not exactly pedestrian-friendly, with only a handful of sidewalks. The neighborhood is characterized by a steep slope, giving my house a prime position at the top of the \"work out hill.\" Joggers from all around flock here to take advantage of the incline. The road itself is quite hazardous, with potholes and loose gravel making it difficult to drive on. The telephone and electric lines are in a sorry state, often downed by stormy weather and requiring frequent repairs, which gives them a patchwork appearance. There's an abundance of evergreen trees all around, much to the locals' dislike. The views of the ocean are obstructed, so many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories. During sunset, the water often takes on a brilliant glow, but it's usually cloudy, turning most days into a damp and hazy affair. Moss grows on everything, including roofs, cars, and railings. I've had to spend hours scraping moss off my car after leaving it parked for just a month. There aren't many children in the area, but there's a school nearby. Most residents are elderly, and dogs are more common than kids. They often race down the street or sit in people's lawns. The occasional rabbit can be seen, and they cause quite a bit of trouble for the gardeners. My cats, however, love to hunt them. The usual birds, from sparrows to eagles, can be spotted, but the neighborhood crows keep the hawks and eagles away. There aren't any stores around, but a short hike downhill leads to a few waterfront restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach is not much, but the rocks along the shore are great for skipping. The bay is not very wide, and the opposite shore is often visible through the mist.",
            "I live on a typical suburban street in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a major thoroughfare connecting two state highways, so we get more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Most residents stick to their daily chores and yard work, and the kids play on their bikes and ride their skateboards. We're a tight-knit community, with most of us knowing each other's routines. Our house is at the front corner of the street, so we see everyone coming and going. On weekends, neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, while some even take their kids sledding down the hill on the side street. We're a family of four - myself, my wife, and our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen - so we're used to coming and going as well. In the summer, you can hear lawn mowers nearly every day, while in the fall, it's the scent of burning leaves that fills the air. We like to grill on our back deck, and on holidays, the neighborhood fills up with extra cars and visits from out-of-town relatives. Our garage is at the back, so we don't use the front door often unless someone knocks. I enjoy working in the garage and feeling connected to the neighborhood when the doors are open. On holidays, it's pretty quiet, except for the occasional family visit. Overall, I enjoy living here, but if it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is in the heart of the high desert, where dirt reigns supreme. Unless you've experienced it firsthand, you can't truly grasp what it's like always seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person's spending a fortune on lawn care. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide, but now it's a similar story, though there are many new additions. It's starting to feel more like a city, but I guess that's the way it goes. Most folks here are friendly, but every city has its good and bad sides. I'm surrounded by friendly old timers, so I'd say it's a nice neighborhood. The stores are mostly chain stores like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale, you've got to travel; I don't often see Whole Foods or stores like that around. The most common jobs in my city seem to be construction, which makes sense since there's still plenty of open space to build on. That scares me a bit; I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm happy here, no desire to go back. My full-time job is in construction; I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about my home is the local wildlife. People come to the high desert for its stark beauty and unique ecosystems, and my family has adapted well. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs; right now, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, Victorville offers a family-friendly desert experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair offers a variety of activities and fun. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you're interested in the high desert's natural history and culture, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I'd say mine is a bit unconventional. Unlike most who'd respond, I'm a college student living on campus, with my dormitory as my primary home. The other parts of the campus make up my neighborhood, but to a lesser degree. Despite this, it shares some commonalities with more traditional neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before digging into the specifics, it's important to understand the different types of housing options. First, there are apartments with 2-4 people per room and 4-6 rooms per floor. Each building typically holds around 20 people. Second, there are actual houses, usually housing alumni and rented out to school-affiliated individuals. These are less common, though. Lastly, there are dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students. Here, two people share a room, and it's the most common housing type. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school is known for its diversity, which is evident in the mix of cultures and ages living here. The professional staff mostly live in the houses, while newer students and older students reside in apartments and dorms, respectively. Moving on to the stores and parks, my school operates as a self-contained neighborhood with a variety of dining options and unique school-sponsored stores. It has all you need within its borders. Lastly, the park is a safe and well-maintained space for everyone to enjoy, kept crime-free by the community.",
            "Well, I've been in this neighborhood for about a decade, so I've got some stories to share. When I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was pretty bummed. I miss Riverdale and I loved them, but my parents wanted better for me and my little sister, so we moved to a neighborhood that was considered \"not ghetto\" and had a better high school. It didn't take long to get used to it, and I even made some new friends and enemies in school. I got to know my neighbors, like Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who were right next door. They were great people, almost like family. I even attended Mr. Glen's wedding with my family and had a blast dancing the night away with one of his daughters, Marsharii. I hope she's doing well and flourishing. The neighborhood is like a maze now, but with GPS, I can take my time exploring. I've spent a lot of time with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd go to the park to soothe my soul, bring home sticks from Home Depot, and practice my balance with a bokken wooden sword. There's also a basketball and tennis court, which was great when my dad and Mr. Graves taught me tennis. I haven't played in a while, but it's still nice to know it's there. I've had fun times in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I go to, and I really enjoy it there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars nearby that aren’t too pricey. One of the bars had a name change, and it's a bit more expensive, but the service and drinks are still good. Most people are friendly, either college students or lower-income individuals since the apartments are reasonably priced. There’s an elementary school nearby, so there are many kids around. I don’t know my neighbors, and they seem to enjoy their weed. The management put an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious. The buildings around me are older, but some have been renovated. Down the street, there are newer apartments, but they’re not well-built for the price. A cheap restaurant nearby serves microwaved food on paper plates, and across from it is a gas station with questionable working conditions. However, the road was recently improved by the city, adding sidewalks, grass, and making the area nicer. My building is surrounded by trees that have had a few cut down. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, and just behind it is 43rd street, which isn’t as nice. The sidewalks there are in bad shape, and many buildings look run-down. There are lots of trees to mask the appearance of the buildings. Crime is more common on 43rd street, but I can’t blame it just on the apartments there. Apartments across from me also have high crime rates and a transient population. Despite these issues, I like where I live. It’s affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, especially the university and bus stops within walking distance.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of identical duplexes on a cul-de-sac, with each one painted yellow, white porches, and green metal roofs. They're spaced out to look like individual homes, and most everyone is friendly with each other. We often gather at the end of a random driveway in the evenings to chat while the kids play with their toys or fly kites. It's a refreshing break from the modern, tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. This year has brought tornado warnings, and last night we actually heard the sirens, so we headed to shelter. I found myself in my bathtub with my little dog, purse, and some pillows. My big dog was nervous and barking in the living room. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, with hail melting on the hot pavement. The clearing sky revealed a double rainbow, so I grabbed my camera and snapped pictures for my Facebook friends and family. They, and I, were in awe. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started coming home. Then it was back to business as usual, with moms and kids outside while dinner was cooked. This friendly neighborhood is a delight for someone who recently moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most others. Despite the similar appearances, not all apartments are the same inside. Some are quite small, which doesn't make sense to me. I love walking down the biggest field behind my place to the pond, which isn't for swimming. I've seen deer there and have woken up to the sound of giant bullfrogs. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is announced by the crowing of roosters from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I feel fortunate to have found this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this hood just before I started my eighth grade year. Making friends was tough at first, but I eventually hung out with two dudes, one lived two doors down and another on my street. They're long gone now, but the memories stay. Folks who were here when I rolled in are still around for the most part. My 'hood is pretty standard American suburban fare - two-story houses, kids playing out every warm weekend, quiet most days. I've never had a beef with anyone here. I've left packages on my porch plenty of times, never once got snatched. I trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my place, full of memories - basketball, football, baseball, and even my worst memory there, when I took an elbow to the nose playing football. But the good times outweigh the bad. Now I go there to hang with my cousin's kids, who love the swings and slides. The park stirs up all kinds of nostalgia.\n\nThe 'hood is diverse - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian eats all nearby, even an Indian store for those Indian food cravings. Most folks use apps for delivery these days, but you can still find pizza places and other joints. There's everything you need here - dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco for groceries. And even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling adventurous. Overall, I'm fond of my neighborhood. Hearing about other folks' horror stories with their neighbors makes me appreciate mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town, blending seamlessly with the rest of South Carolina. While it doesn't boast anything extraordinary, it's got a notable impact on the agricultural sector. Johnston is proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it proudly displays on the welcoming sign. The town is primarily made up of farmland, with peach orchards and cattle fields being the most common sights. Houses are widely spaced out, often two stories with either metal roofs to combat the summer heat or gray shingles, and are typically located farther back from the road to allow for the use of the front fields for crops or animals. The main part of town features a single stop light at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the only stores around. Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger joint, are the main fast food options. A pizzeria used to be there but closed down recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a small family-owned pharmacy, best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store in town is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, but many locals prefer to shop at the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The Dollar General store is the most popular, offering a wide variety of everyday items and staying busy from opening to closing. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small, well-known furniture store with a reputation for delivering purchased items. Attached to this is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomers offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, and other services. Both a doctor's and a veterinary practice are situated away from the town center but are well-equipped to serve the community. The only school in town is Johnston Elementary School, but students in fifth grade and above must attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. There are no parks in town, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is currently being developed to offer more opportunities for outings and attract potential residents. There aren't many entertainment options; the town lacks movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this, it's a charming town, small enough that you can pass through it without even realizing!",
            "I first heard about my place while listening to a podcast on missing persons. It was a bit of a shock. The neighborhood rents were insane, over a thousand bucks a month. None of my friends had heard about it either. Maybe it's just the struggle. I know a few friends are so broke they cry themselves to sleep. Things are pricey, but we've learned to live frugally. You get used to the smell of old toys and clothes from the flea market. You smell less in adulthood. Sometimes you smoke, or you just get used to the way things are. But the flea market always finds its way into your life. The smell of adulthood is old magazines stacked on a closed piano. It stays no matter how much you clean. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from one end, you can hit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with people and cars, but you wouldn't hear it inside the stores. Silence reigns, no matter how many people or cars pass by. It's a great place to while away an afternoon. This city is growing, with one of the biggest online shopping empires calling it headquarters. It's still got some growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own goals, and no one asks for much. Here, you can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned means you care. People don't pry into each other's lives much. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city just rolls on. It's a lively place. My neighbors are always doing something. There's a pianist next door and two amateur vocalists upstairs. We're not just neighbors; it's like a community of friends. We help each other out, celebrate together, and mourn together. I'm lucky to be here. Most of my neighbors are great, and they treat me well. I make sure to take out the trash and leave food, and they do the same. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's presence. Living in this massive, impersonal modernist sprawl might seem to suck, but it's people like my neighbors that make it feel like I haven't totally messed up my life.",
            "The area I live in could be described as typical cookie-cutter suburbia. The neighborhood's homeowner's association is quite active, resulting in well-maintained single-family homes. The front yards are small, with landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Every house has a two-car garage, and the roads are pristine with newly paved concrete. Most houses are single story, though you might see a few two-story ones. The mail set-up is more like apartments, with large groupings of mailboxes at the end of the street. Two larger lockers for packages are also present. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of the city, part rural and part suburban, with plenty of open land. There are multiple community pools and walking trails, and the area is predominantly made up of retired people with a mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city is surprisingly large by population but has a small-town feel. Amenities are plentiful, including a mall that isn't huge but gets the job done. Grocery stores range from high-end organic to bargain outlets with minimal staff. All in all, the neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard. We have pools, walking trails, and easy access to major chains by car.",
            "I hail from a small Midwestern town that's on the outskirts of a major city. The east side of my neighborhood, where I live, is the most economically challenged part of town. Most houses here are rented to or owned by folks with limited income, but it isn't unpleasant. My neighbors are friendly and always give a smile and a 'hello' as I walk by. The crime rates here are a bit higher than other parts of town, but it's generally safe. There have been a few violent incidents nearby, including a shooting and a homicide in the last decade. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. We've been fortunate to avoid direct crime, just the occasional item disappearing from our porch when we forget to bring it in. The opioid epidemic has hit hard in our town, with lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses, but there are resources in place to combat it, including rehab centers and Narcan training. Despite these challenges, there's a lot to love about our town. My son's elementary school is fantastic, with excellent teachers and staff, and a positive atmosphere that has made my special needs son feel right at home. The PTO is active and hosts many family events. The school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students to ensure no child goes hungry. The city council has made improvements to the town's appearance, but most of the work has been done in the center and on the west side, where most shops are. The east side, where I live, feels neglected, which some of us gripe about. Still, I enjoy living here. Folks are friendly, the schools are great, shopping options are good, and our home is comfortable. We've been here for over 16 years and don't plan to leave.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hub, nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historic significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old live theater, while just a block down, there's a quaint arcade bar that draws diverse crowds on warm summer nights, especially in June and July. The city park, a few blocks up, is quite spacious for the area, with concrete paths and steep steps. During winter, homeless folks set up tents along the sidewalk and steps for warmth, as the rain often keeps them from sleeping in the cold. Despite being known for decades of gang violence, the people of the neighborhood work hard to keep it clean. They still carry the stories of those times, and even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the city, they care deeply about their community. The warnings to avoid the Hill after dark, especially if you're white, echo the past, but I find it to be more about social conditioning than genuine danger. I blend in well enough to feel accepted, even though I'm a transplant. The Hilltop feels alive, especially at night, where people have shown kindness and support, like offering me a jacket rather than stealing. I've had laundromat staff stay open late to charge my phone when I was caught in the rain, and even on the gloomiest nights, someone has stopped to offer me kindness. No matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home.",
            "I call home small town Michigan, smack dab in the heart of Rural America. It's a world away from the bustle of big city life, where farmland meets tourist hotspots. No Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s here—you've got to hit the road if you need something. But don't let that fool you, I live in one of the most breathtaking places on earth, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank my \"city,\" and every corner has a beach to dip your toes in. The neighborhood reflects the charm of small towns—no cookie-cutter homes, but older homes, some updated, some still old-fashioned. Basements are visible from the road, aluminum siding is prevalent, and homes come in every color imaginable. Kids are everywhere, playing on trampolines, playing on playgrounds, and riding their bikes. Neighbors wave and smile, and the lawns are maintained, not a leaf out of place. It's not glamorous, but it's peaceful, safe, and exactly what people dream of—a place to call home. The county sheriff's department and jail are walking distance, and the health department is right next door. The recycling center, baseball fields, and tiny airport make it feel like a close-knit community. Ice cream is just a stroll away, and downtown is a short bike ride. It's a fantastic place to live, and my kids can ride their bikes to the park just 8 blocks away."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My hood is a massive mix of folks and buildings. The city is so big, it's like a puzzle where every piece looks different. Residential areas are scattered around commercial zones, filled with stores, offices, and eateries. There are top-notch chains and independent boutiques, often right next to each other. Some of these stores are so close, you can walk to them from your home. There's even a couple of parks nearby, where plenty of folks with their little ones hang out.\n\nMy neighborhood is a real melting pot. We've got a strong LGBTQ+ presence, an Orthodox Jewish community, and even some former Soviet refugees and immigrants. Just outside my hood, there are whole communities for folks from Korea, China, Armenia, and many more. The city's so spread out, a 10-mile drive can take hours, thanks to traffic. Almost nobody walks around, which is a bummer because the city has so much to offer. Construction is happening all over, adding big apartment buildings left and right. While it's popular, some residents worry about the extra traffic and people. But there's no shortage of housing options—single-family homes, duplexes, condos, and more. And the people? All ages, all walks of life. I don't know many of my neighbors, but I've got some great memories from my childhood of playing outside with friends. The city's always changing, and it's filled with surprises.",
            "My neighborhood is a real mix. Most houses are single family, but a few have been split in half, still attached, if you can picture that. My place has a small yard out front and a driveway to the left. It's like a throwback to the 'American Dream' era, when living in the suburbs was all the rage. This dream still pulls us in, but times have changed. The people here aren't as hopeful as they used to be, and the yard maintenance isn't what it once was, but there's still a car or two in every driveway. Kids are playing like the world is their backyard, and the old schoolhouse still stands, inspiring today's youth while stirring up memories for the old-timers. There aren't many churches, but the basketball courts are still packed. Every house is unique, but they all feel the same. There's a supermarket called 'Super A,' owned by a friendly Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family around. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and cars have to yield to kids playing footy. Most folks here have been around for generations and have stories of when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school once, but when Hollywood stopped making karate movies, it became a pharmacy. A small movie theater still shows old films at a discount, favored by the elders. There's a single expressway nearby, but the exits are in the neighboring town. There was a petition to get an exit for our town, supported by the youth and opposed by the elders, who thought it would ruin the town. They prevailed, and the city council denied the request. A new high school is being built, and we're debating a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be perfect for our town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - it's a residential area behind a shopping strip, not where one would expect to find living spaces. After all, it's not where most people would want to live. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that are only occupied during annual family reunions, you'll stumble upon an entire thriving community. Nestled within these communities are a few apartment complexes, arranged meticulously next to each other like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and lined up along the road. The first apartment complexes you'll see have made headlines for some unsavory activities, so we won't dwell on them. But the complexes beside and next to them present a whole different world, one that most people in the area don't know about.\n\nJust across the street from these complexes is the community college's satellite campus - a quiet, peaceful set of buildings that stand guard along the road. Students file in with coffee cups in hand, yawning as they start their sleepy days at 7 in the morning. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters honk their horns and groan at the added traffic on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential street, where a park sits on one side, and a rehabilitation center for those with broken bones stands on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children play in the grass, flipping and spinning across the prickly green blades, while bees lazily buzz in the flower patches along the road. Retired locals walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at teens on skateboards and nodding politely to the teenage girls chatting by the playground equipment. A sushi place in a nearby strip mall serves cheap food that's not too busy, with a swimming supply store and a nail salon nestled nearby. You can fill your pool with the season's supply while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken, all in one go - the beauty of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens in the park cling to cold, sweating cups of frosty treats, topped with various ingredients, while they perform tricks on their skateboards and vape. It's a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south, where change is as rare as time itself.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the cornfields stretching out endlessly. “Right here!” I said, knowing she’d be blown away by the vast openness of the landscape. She hails from a town where the grocery store is a quick walk from her house—she’d never seen this much open space. Stunned by the omnipresence of cornfields, I shared my upbringing in rural Ohio with her, and that’s when she finally understood who I was and where I came from. Driving along a two-lane country road, you’ll find a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it is the small development I call home. The houses are predominantly brick and stucco, and each one sits on at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in tending to. During springtime, the neighborhood is abuzz with annual flowers and the ever-changing foliage of midwestern trees. The driveways gleam with top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, polished to a high shine from frequent car washes. Heading toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a warm smile. He spends the day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his lawnmower, a source of amusement for the entire neighborhood. Despite his age, he remains a genuine and fascinating person with a rich history. In his younger days, he was a doctor, often blending in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you’ll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are plentiful and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear the bullfrogs, the stream's gentle flow, and occasional “moo” sounds from nearby farms. Crossing a handmade wooden bridge leads to a pristine oasis filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here, I spent my childhood building tree forts and “hunting” animals, with neighborhood kids always available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be harsh, but they’re also breathtaking. The lush green yard transforms into a barren wilderness, with trees shedding their vibrant summer colors. Snowfall adds an enchanting touch, turning the yard into a winter wonderland with snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister. Growing up, my sister and I fought often, and our winters were filled with snowball battles. We’d build massive igloo-like forts, our secret snow arsenals. In our own little wonderland, we played pretend, free from the worries of the world.",
            "The first thing you need to get about Portland, Oregon is its unique nature. The unofficial town motto, plastered on the side of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this is a nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when it was less known and less expensive, fostering a creatively eccentric subculture. For others, it's an invitation - come to Portland, where being different is celebrated. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the omnipresent construction of condos to house them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean accepting everything, but it does mean accepting things that aren't typically accepted. Weird doesn't mean the absence of modern comforts or issues. Like the rest of the country, we get most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unusual, but Portland has plenty of normalcy too. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, we have vibrantly painted houses, home gardens filled with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes, traditionally cardboard boxes with unwanted items, but sometimes plastic bags or boxes, contain something special. A treasure, perfect for the passerby, sometimes surprisingly so. They often hold clothes and books, but can contain anything. The magical atmosphere of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. At least, that's what it is to me, but I'm just one kind of weird among many. Some of my neighbors would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They prefer activities like goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is filled with people who love all sorts of things. Portland is filled with people who chase their dreams or dream about chasing them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug issues often stem from mental health struggles, and the constant rain and gloomy skies throughout much of the year, combined with the city's dreary atmosphere, may contribute. Portland also faces homelessness, which no one seems to know how to tackle. The homeless are drawn by Portland's social services, which are better than in most places, but they're not enough, as the situation is the same across the country. The non-homeless population alternates between care and resentment. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains have always been there, standing sentinel over the north, bearing witness to the daily sunrise and sunset. No matter how busy life gets or how much I forget about them, they remain steadfast, untouched by the trials of life. On those days when I'm at my most stressed and anxious, the mountains call out to me, and when I turn to face them, they offer solace, lending me the strength to keep going, one step at a time. I first moved here for my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were what initially drew me in. Sure, the university has its own share of stunning sights, but it's the mountains that truly hold my heart. The rest of the town is beautiful, with cafes where countless hours were spent cramming, and the downtown area just a short walk or bus ride away, where the faded colored bricks of restaurants and office buildings give it an old-world charm. This small-town feel doesn't last long, though, as one can easily escape to the serene, suburban streets by passing the library. This blend of bustling city and quiet town makes the city wonderfully unique, like a mystery waiting to be explored. It's easy to create lasting memories here, each tied to a specific part of town, whether it's walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after a late-night study session or rushing through the downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater. But the town also holds tough memories, as all places do in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a place for deep reflection or late-night tears during existential crises. As I watched the turtles and ducks and insects going about their lives, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to find my place in life. So, I walked past the ponds, the park, and the houses that screamed suburban comfort until I reached a main street. The sun cast its brilliant rays on the palm trees, painting the sky as I looked up, and I realized I was heading north. There they were, as they had always been—the mountains, rising majestically against the hazy blue and yellow sky. They spoke to me without words, rekindling my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you're planning on checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it! Public transportation here is a breeze and is a popular choice for getting around New York City. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of NYC. During your visit, get ready to see Asian stores everywhere. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurst has welcomed a significant Asian population, and you'll find an Asian-owned business on nearly every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular. These businesses are beloved by locals for their high-quality food, reasonable prices, and convenience. Just nearby, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other, making it super easy to grab groceries. But don't think Bensonhurst is only populated by Asians. It's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living side by side. Most of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned. There's also a recently renovated park nearby with ten basketball courts, a soccer field, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain. As you'd expect in NYC, the parks are diverse and welcoming. The neighborhood is primarily residential, with a mix of co-op living, condo apartments, and two-family homes. Most folks are friendly, but it can be noisy. You'll often hear cars blasting music or revving their engines as they pass by, which can be a bit disruptive. Be cautious at night, as while Bensonhurst is generally safe, there can be unpredictable individuals. I've had my share of trouble here in the past, including physical assault and package theft. Dog waste is also a common issue, with people not following the rules about cleaning up after their pets. You'll see dog waste on the sidewalk every morning, so keep your shoes clean!",
            "The area I live in is not exactly pedestrian-friendly, with only a handful of sidewalks. The neighborhood is characterized by a steep slope, giving my house a prime position at the top of the \"work out hill.\" Joggers from all around flock here to take advantage of the incline. The road itself is quite hazardous, with potholes and loose gravel making it difficult to drive on. The telephone and electric lines are in a sorry state, often downed by stormy weather and requiring frequent repairs, which gives them a patchwork appearance. There's an abundance of evergreen trees all around, much to the locals' dislike. The views of the ocean are obstructed, so many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories. During sunset, the water often takes on a brilliant glow, but it's usually cloudy, turning most days into a damp and hazy affair. Moss grows on everything, including roofs, cars, and railings. I've had to spend hours scraping moss off my car after leaving it parked for just a month. There aren't many children in the area, but there's a school nearby. Most residents are elderly, and dogs are more common than kids. They often race down the street or sit in people's lawns. The occasional rabbit can be seen, and they cause quite a bit of trouble for the gardeners. My cats, however, love to hunt them. The usual birds, from sparrows to eagles, can be spotted, but the neighborhood crows keep the hawks and eagles away. There aren't any stores around, but a short hike downhill leads to a few waterfront restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach is not much, but the rocks along the shore are great for skipping. The bay is not very wide, and the opposite shore is often visible through the mist.",
            "I live on a typical suburban street in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a major thoroughfare connecting two state highways, so we get more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Most residents stick to their daily chores and yard work, and the kids play on their bikes and ride their skateboards. We're a tight-knit community, with most of us knowing each other's routines. Our house is at the front corner of the street, so we see everyone coming and going. On weekends, neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, while some even take their kids sledding down the hill on the side street. We're a family of four - myself, my wife, and our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen - so we're used to coming and going as well. In the summer, you can hear lawn mowers nearly every day, while in the fall, it's the scent of burning leaves that fills the air. We like to grill on our back deck, and on holidays, the neighborhood fills up with extra cars and visits from out-of-town relatives. Our garage is at the back, so we don't use the front door often unless someone knocks. I enjoy working in the garage and feeling connected to the neighborhood when the doors are open. On holidays, it's pretty quiet, except for the occasional family visit. Overall, I enjoy living here, but if it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is in the heart of the high desert, where dirt reigns supreme. Unless you've experienced it firsthand, you can't truly grasp what it's like always seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person's spending a fortune on lawn care. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide, but now it's a similar story, though there are many new additions. It's starting to feel more like a city, but I guess that's the way it goes. Most folks here are friendly, but every city has its good and bad sides. I'm surrounded by friendly old timers, so I'd say it's a nice neighborhood. The stores are mostly chain stores like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale, you've got to travel; I don't often see Whole Foods or stores like that around. The most common jobs in my city seem to be construction, which makes sense since there's still plenty of open space to build on. That scares me a bit; I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm happy here, no desire to go back. My full-time job is in construction; I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about my home is the local wildlife. People come to the high desert for its stark beauty and unique ecosystems, and my family has adapted well. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs; right now, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, Victorville offers a family-friendly desert experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair offers a variety of activities and fun. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you're interested in the high desert's natural history and culture, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I'd say mine is a bit unconventional. Unlike most who'd respond, I'm a college student living on campus, with my dormitory as my primary home. The other parts of the campus make up my neighborhood, but to a lesser degree. Despite this, it shares some commonalities with more traditional neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before digging into the specifics, it's important to understand the different types of housing options. First, there are apartments with 2-4 people per room and 4-6 rooms per floor. Each building typically holds around 20 people. Second, there are actual houses, usually housing alumni and rented out to school-affiliated individuals. These are less common, though. Lastly, there are dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students. Here, two people share a room, and it's the most common housing type. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school is known for its diversity, which is evident in the mix of cultures and ages living here. The professional staff mostly live in the houses, while newer students and older students reside in apartments and dorms, respectively. Moving on to the stores and parks, my school operates as a self-contained neighborhood with a variety of dining options and unique school-sponsored stores. It has all you need within its borders. Lastly, the park is a safe and well-maintained space for everyone to enjoy, kept crime-free by the community.",
            "Well, I've been in this neighborhood for about a decade, so I've got some stories to share. When I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was pretty bummed. I miss Riverdale and I loved them, but my parents wanted better for me and my little sister, so we moved to a neighborhood that was considered \"not ghetto\" and had a better high school. It didn't take long to get used to it, and I even made some new friends and enemies in school. I got to know my neighbors, like Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who were right next door. They were great people, almost like family. I even attended Mr. Glen's wedding with my family and had a blast dancing the night away with one of his daughters, Marsharii. I hope she's doing well and flourishing. The neighborhood is like a maze now, but with GPS, I can take my time exploring. I've spent a lot of time with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd go to the park to soothe my soul, bring home sticks from Home Depot, and practice my balance with a bokken wooden sword. There's also a basketball and tennis court, which was great when my dad and Mr. Graves taught me tennis. I haven't played in a while, but it's still nice to know it's there. I've had fun times in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I go to, and I really enjoy it there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars nearby that aren’t too pricey. One of the bars had a name change, and it's a bit more expensive, but the service and drinks are still good. Most people are friendly, either college students or lower-income individuals since the apartments are reasonably priced. There’s an elementary school nearby, so there are many kids around. I don’t know my neighbors, and they seem to enjoy their weed. The management put an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious. The buildings around me are older, but some have been renovated. Down the street, there are newer apartments, but they’re not well-built for the price. A cheap restaurant nearby serves microwaved food on paper plates, and across from it is a gas station with questionable working conditions. However, the road was recently improved by the city, adding sidewalks, grass, and making the area nicer. My building is surrounded by trees that have had a few cut down. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, and just behind it is 43rd street, which isn’t as nice. The sidewalks there are in bad shape, and many buildings look run-down. There are lots of trees to mask the appearance of the buildings. Crime is more common on 43rd street, but I can’t blame it just on the apartments there. Apartments across from me also have high crime rates and a transient population. Despite these issues, I like where I live. It’s affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, especially the university and bus stops within walking distance.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of identical duplexes on a cul-de-sac, with each one painted yellow, white porches, and green metal roofs. They're spaced out to look like individual homes, and most everyone is friendly with each other. We often gather at the end of a random driveway in the evenings to chat while the kids play with their toys or fly kites. It's a refreshing break from the modern, tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. This year has brought tornado warnings, and last night we actually heard the sirens, so we headed to shelter. I found myself in my bathtub with my little dog, purse, and some pillows. My big dog was nervous and barking in the living room. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, with hail melting on the hot pavement. The clearing sky revealed a double rainbow, so I grabbed my camera and snapped pictures for my Facebook friends and family. They, and I, were in awe. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started coming home. Then it was back to business as usual, with moms and kids outside while dinner was cooked. This friendly neighborhood is a delight for someone who recently moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most others. Despite the similar appearances, not all apartments are the same inside. Some are quite small, which doesn't make sense to me. I love walking down the biggest field behind my place to the pond, which isn't for swimming. I've seen deer there and have woken up to the sound of giant bullfrogs. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is announced by the crowing of roosters from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I feel fortunate to have found this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this hood just before I started my eighth grade year. Making friends was tough at first, but I eventually hung out with two dudes, one lived two doors down and another on my street. They're long gone now, but the memories stay. Folks who were here when I rolled in are still around for the most part. My 'hood is pretty standard American suburban fare - two-story houses, kids playing out every warm weekend, quiet most days. I've never had a beef with anyone here. I've left packages on my porch plenty of times, never once got snatched. I trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my place, full of memories - basketball, football, baseball, and even my worst memory there, when I took an elbow to the nose playing football. But the good times outweigh the bad. Now I go there to hang with my cousin's kids, who love the swings and slides. The park stirs up all kinds of nostalgia.\n\nThe 'hood is diverse - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian eats all nearby, even an Indian store for those Indian food cravings. Most folks use apps for delivery these days, but you can still find pizza places and other joints. There's everything you need here - dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco for groceries. And even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling adventurous. Overall, I'm fond of my neighborhood. Hearing about other folks' horror stories with their neighbors makes me appreciate mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town, blending seamlessly with the rest of South Carolina. While it doesn't boast anything extraordinary, it's got a notable impact on the agricultural sector. Johnston is proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it proudly displays on the welcoming sign. The town is primarily made up of farmland, with peach orchards and cattle fields being the most common sights. Houses are widely spaced out, often two stories with either metal roofs to combat the summer heat or gray shingles, and are typically located farther back from the road to allow for the use of the front fields for crops or animals. The main part of town features a single stop light at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the only stores around. Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger joint, are the main fast food options. A pizzeria used to be there but closed down recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a small family-owned pharmacy, best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store in town is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, but many locals prefer to shop at the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The Dollar General store is the most popular, offering a wide variety of everyday items and staying busy from opening to closing. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small, well-known furniture store with a reputation for delivering purchased items. Attached to this is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomers offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, and other services. Both a doctor's and a veterinary practice are situated away from the town center but are well-equipped to serve the community. The only school in town is Johnston Elementary School, but students in fifth grade and above must attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. There are no parks in town, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is currently being developed to offer more opportunities for outings and attract potential residents. There aren't many entertainment options; the town lacks movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this, it's a charming town, small enough that you can pass through it without even realizing!",
            "I first heard about my place while listening to a podcast on missing persons. It was a bit of a shock. The neighborhood rents were insane, over a thousand bucks a month. None of my friends had heard about it either. Maybe it's just the struggle. I know a few friends are so broke they cry themselves to sleep. Things are pricey, but we've learned to live frugally. You get used to the smell of old toys and clothes from the flea market. You smell less in adulthood. Sometimes you smoke, or you just get used to the way things are. But the flea market always finds its way into your life. The smell of adulthood is old magazines stacked on a closed piano. It stays no matter how much you clean. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from one end, you can hit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with people and cars, but you wouldn't hear it inside the stores. Silence reigns, no matter how many people or cars pass by. It's a great place to while away an afternoon. This city is growing, with one of the biggest online shopping empires calling it headquarters. It's still got some growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own goals, and no one asks for much. Here, you can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned means you care. People don't pry into each other's lives much. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city just rolls on. It's a lively place. My neighbors are always doing something. There's a pianist next door and two amateur vocalists upstairs. We're not just neighbors; it's like a community of friends. We help each other out, celebrate together, and mourn together. I'm lucky to be here. Most of my neighbors are great, and they treat me well. I make sure to take out the trash and leave food, and they do the same. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's presence. Living in this massive, impersonal modernist sprawl might seem to suck, but it's people like my neighbors that make it feel like I haven't totally messed up my life.",
            "The area I live in could be described as typical cookie-cutter suburbia. The neighborhood's homeowner's association is quite active, resulting in well-maintained single-family homes. The front yards are small, with landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Every house has a two-car garage, and the roads are pristine with newly paved concrete. Most houses are single story, though you might see a few two-story ones. The mail set-up is more like apartments, with large groupings of mailboxes at the end of the street. Two larger lockers for packages are also present. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of the city, part rural and part suburban, with plenty of open land. There are multiple community pools and walking trails, and the area is predominantly made up of retired people with a mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city is surprisingly large by population but has a small-town feel. Amenities are plentiful, including a mall that isn't huge but gets the job done. Grocery stores range from high-end organic to bargain outlets with minimal staff. All in all, the neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard. We have pools, walking trails, and easy access to major chains by car.",
            "I hail from a small Midwestern town that's on the outskirts of a major city. The east side of my neighborhood, where I live, is the most economically challenged part of town. Most houses here are rented to or owned by folks with limited income, but it isn't unpleasant. My neighbors are friendly and always give a smile and a 'hello' as I walk by. The crime rates here are a bit higher than other parts of town, but it's generally safe. There have been a few violent incidents nearby, including a shooting and a homicide in the last decade. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. We've been fortunate to avoid direct crime, just the occasional item disappearing from our porch when we forget to bring it in. The opioid epidemic has hit hard in our town, with lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses, but there are resources in place to combat it, including rehab centers and Narcan training. Despite these challenges, there's a lot to love about our town. My son's elementary school is fantastic, with excellent teachers and staff, and a positive atmosphere that has made my special needs son feel right at home. The PTO is active and hosts many family events. The school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students to ensure no child goes hungry. The city council has made improvements to the town's appearance, but most of the work has been done in the center and on the west side, where most shops are. The east side, where I live, feels neglected, which some of us gripe about. Still, I enjoy living here. Folks are friendly, the schools are great, shopping options are good, and our home is comfortable. We've been here for over 16 years and don't plan to leave.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hub, nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historic significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old live theater, while just a block down, there's a quaint arcade bar that draws diverse crowds on warm summer nights, especially in June and July. The city park, a few blocks up, is quite spacious for the area, with concrete paths and steep steps. During winter, homeless folks set up tents along the sidewalk and steps for warmth, as the rain often keeps them from sleeping in the cold. Despite being known for decades of gang violence, the people of the neighborhood work hard to keep it clean. They still carry the stories of those times, and even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the city, they care deeply about their community. The warnings to avoid the Hill after dark, especially if you're white, echo the past, but I find it to be more about social conditioning than genuine danger. I blend in well enough to feel accepted, even though I'm a transplant. The Hilltop feels alive, especially at night, where people have shown kindness and support, like offering me a jacket rather than stealing. I've had laundromat staff stay open late to charge my phone when I was caught in the rain, and even on the gloomiest nights, someone has stopped to offer me kindness. No matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home.",
            "I call home small town Michigan, smack dab in the heart of Rural America. It's a world away from the bustle of big city life, where farmland meets tourist hotspots. No Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s here—you've got to hit the road if you need something. But don't let that fool you, I live in one of the most breathtaking places on earth, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank my \"city,\" and every corner has a beach to dip your toes in. The neighborhood reflects the charm of small towns—no cookie-cutter homes, but older homes, some updated, some still old-fashioned. Basements are visible from the road, aluminum siding is prevalent, and homes come in every color imaginable. Kids are everywhere, playing on trampolines, playing on playgrounds, and riding their bikes. Neighbors wave and smile, and the lawns are maintained, not a leaf out of place. It's not glamorous, but it's peaceful, safe, and exactly what people dream of—a place to call home. The county sheriff's department and jail are walking distance, and the health department is right next door. The recycling center, baseball fields, and tiny airport make it feel like a close-knit community. Ice cream is just a stroll away, and downtown is a short bike ride. It's a fantastic place to live, and my kids can ride their bikes to the park just 8 blocks away."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Since I live in a bustling metropolis, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are haphazardly interspersed with commercial sections, where a wide array of businesses operate, from offices to various stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. You name it, we've got it, with no shortage of new eateries or shops to explore. Some of these stores are famous, large-scale corporations, while others are trendy boutiques that line the streets, drawing in shoppers from otherwise quiet neighborhoods. There are even a couple of nearby parks where families with young children are often seen. The people who live here are just as diverse as the businesses and attractions. Just in one small area, we have a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish population, and a contingent of former Soviet Union refugees and immigrants. Just a few miles away, there are even more groups of various ethnicities, like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, among others. However, even a short 10-mile drive can take up to two hours due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours. Most people in the city don't walk around; cars are the primary mode of transportation. This leads to some of the worst traffic congestion in the world, making parking spots hard to come by. Ironically, the city has been experiencing a boom in construction, with numerous new apartment buildings going up. While it might seem like a popular place to live, many residents are wary of the increased population and traffic. The city offers a variety of housing options, from large apartment buildings to smaller homes and condominiums. Within my neighborhood alone, there's a mix of single-family homes, duplexes, and other types of residences. The age range of the residents is quite diverse as well, and to be honest, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not like the close-knit community I remember from my childhood, where I used to play with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends.",
            "My neighborhood is a patchwork of houses, some single-family and others split into two attached units. My home boasts a small front yard and a driveway to the left, reminiscent of the suburban dream that once captivated our country. That dream, though fading, still clings to us and to the neighborhood, calling upon us to hold onto it. The residents, while not as optimistic as they once were, still maintain a sense of community, with cars in every driveway and kids playing in the streets. The public school, standing for nearly a century, serves as a beacon of the future for the youth and a nostalgic reminder for the elders. The churches are sparse and often empty, but the basketball courts remain filled with activity. Each house carries its unique story, yet all feel the same. A large supermarket, 'Super A,' is run by a Yemeni family, possibly the sole Arab presence in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American, with the streets wide and filled with kids playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations, each with stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. A former karate school, now a pharmacy, serves as a reminder of the changing times, while a movie theater showcases old films, attracting the older crowd who appreciate the quiet escape. A single expressway runs through town, with entrances and exits in the neighboring town. A past petition for an exit in our town failed, as the youth's support was no match for the elders' resistance. The elders argued that it would ruin the town, and the city council agreed. A new high school is being constructed, and we are debating on a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin could best represent our town.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance – this residential area behind a shopping strip isn't what one would expect to find housing. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that only come alive during summer family reunions, you'll discover a thriving community. This neighborhood hides a collection of apartment complexes, stacked together like Russian nesting dolls, piecemeal and carefully placed in a line down the road. The first ones you'll see have been in the spotlight for some less-than-savory activities, so let's skip over them. The ones beside and beyond them, though, are a different story, almost completely unknown to the locals. Right across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus – a sleepy, quiet place where students come and go with coffee in hand, yawning as they start their days. The iron gates creak open, letting them in, while commuters grumble at the delay, especially on days when attendance is high. The road intersects with another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those who've met with unfortunate injuries on the other side. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a slow, lazy ceiling fan that stirs the hot, thick summer air. Children play in the park, doing cartwheels and stunts in the grass, while bees lazily buzz by in the nearby flower patches. Retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, exchanging nods with teens while eying the skateboarders warily. Beside the park, a strip mall houses a sushi place with affordable food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon nestled between them. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and chow down on hibachi chicken, all in one trip – the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where you'll often see teens with cold, toppings-covered cups, doing tricks on their skateboards and vaping. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana – a piece of history where time seems to stand still.",
            "Where is everything? she asked as we drove past the corn fields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she'd be blown away by the vast open landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her house—she'd never seen so much open space before. Overwhelmed by the corn fields, I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane highway, you'll reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it is the small development where I live. The houses are mostly made of brick and stucco, with each home boasting at least a half-acre of land that everyone takes pride in maintaining. In the spring, the annual flowers and midwestern trees change with each season. The driveways are filled with luxury Mercedes Benz cars that gleam in the sunlight after a good car wash. Continuing along the road towards my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He spends his days mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he's always genuine and has a unique history. Though he's aged and lost some of his wit, he was once a doctor and blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there's a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you'll hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. From building treehouses to \"hunting\" animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood kid to play with. The winters in my small town can be brutal, but there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become barren skeletons of bark. When snowfall blesses the town, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my sister and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We'd build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland, we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.",
            "Portland, Oregon, is a place that's known for its quirks and eccentricities, with the unofficial town slogan being \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This isn't just a throwback to the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, but a call to embrace a unique culture. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't just about being open to the unconventional; it's about taking things less seriously. We have yoga and hipsters, business professionals and families. In my neighborhood, you'll find colorful houses, gardens with flowers and herbs, and free boxes. These boxes contain treasures, sometimes clothes, books, or even other items, left by someone who no longer needs them. It's a magical experience walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood, but it's just one of many ways Portland's weirdness manifests. There are goat yoga classes and Timbers soccer matches, dreams pursued and dreams chased in bars. Portland has its issues, like drug and homelessness problems, but it's not afraid to face them head-on. The non-homeless population is divided between compassion and frustration, but that's not what makes Portland weird. That's just Portland being Portland.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence. They stand tall in the north, greeting the sun's rise and set with unwavering loyalty. No matter how absorbed I am with work or life, they remain steadfast and unshaken by life's challenges. On days when stress and anxiety overwhelm me, they call out to be seen, and with their silent strength, they offer solace and the resolve to keep moving forward, one day at a time. I first came to live here during my undergraduate years, and the mountains north of campus were the first to captivate me. While the university has its share of stunning sights in architecture, water, and greenery, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is beautiful, with countless cafes that have been the backdrop to many hours of caffeine-fueled studying. Just a short walk or bus ride from the campus, you're enveloped in an old-world charm that rivals that of the bustling, neighboring city. This blend of atmospheres, from the frenetic energy of the downtown area to the quiet serenity of the residential neighborhoods, creates a unique vibe that encourages exploration and discovery. Here, memories are forged, whether it's laughing with friends after an all-nighter past the rusted park swings or racing through the downtown to catch a movie in the fancy theater. Yet, the town also holds memories of hardship, as every place does in life. The ponds, in particular, have seen many a tear shed in the quiet of the night, reflecting on life's mysteries. As I walked past the pond and the park with its suburban homes, the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees, painting the sky a vibrant blue and yellow. As I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north, and there they were, as they always had been. The towering mountains dominated the hazy horizon, and with their silent, steadfast presence, they ignited a sense of resilience within me.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it. Public transit is super convenient, a staple of New York City living. Bensonhurt is quite urban, so it feels like you're right in the heart of NYC. Expect to see a plethora of Asian stores which have been popping up over the past couple of decades. Asian supermarkets and laundromats are abundant, known for their high-quality food and reasonable prices. In my area alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. It's not all Asian though; Bensonhurt is diverse, with immigrants and their American-born children living side by side. Many local businesses are Asian-owned, alongside a recently renovated park with multiple basketball courts, a large soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. The park is inclusive, welcoming people of all backgrounds. Corporate buildings are scarce; most homes are two-family houses. The residents are mostly friendly, but it can be noisy with cars blasting music and revving engines. At night, while Bensonhurt is generally safe, be cautious. You may encounter trouble-makers or package thieves. I've experienced physical assaults in the past, but that was years ago. Package thieves are common, and dog waste is a persistent issue. Despite the city's fine for not cleaning up after dogs, people often ignore it. Every morning, you'll find dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. It's a pet peeve of mine! Keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, there aren't many sidewalks, and the road goes downhill like a workout, leading people to call it the \"work out hill.\" Joggers love it for their daily runs. The street's condition isn't great; it's pitted and a bit dangerous to drive on. The wiring and power lines are tattered and need constant repair, especially after storms. There are tall evergreen trees everywhere, but locals don't like them; they cut down as many as possible to see the ocean. Many houses have large glass-fronted second stories to take in the view of the bay. The sunset is stunning, with the water lit from below and the sky turning orange, but the weather's often cloudy, and moss grows on everything due to the dampness. It's common to see cats chasing rabbits and dogs running in the streets. The school nearby means there are hardly any kids, but dogs are everywhere. Birds and the occasional hawk or eagle can be seen, and some restaurants serve fresh seafood along the waterfront, with rocks great for throwing into the water. The bay isn't wide, and you can see the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee, right at the crossroads of two state highways, which means I get a bit more traffic on my street than I'd prefer. Otherwise, it's a quiet neighborhood. There aren't many newcomers, so I'm pretty familiar with most of the folks that live around here. Everyone keeps busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we have sledding on the street, and since our house is at the corner, we see all the comings and goings throughout the day. We tend to take note of any unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs, and kids are out on their bikes. We're mostly home-based, with me, my wife, and our two daughters – aged eleven and fourteen – so everyone is used to seeing us around. We do enjoy outdoor activities, even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill on our back deck; the smell of barbecue always brings a pleasant atmosphere. From March until October, you can hear the lawn mowers nearly every day as the grass grows. The neighborhood has plenty of trees, originally a wooded area, which offers lots of shade. But that means we have to rake and burn leaves every Fall, which I actually enjoy as it signals the arrival of Fall. We've had minimal winter weather lately, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is quite rare. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quite quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees families visiting from out of town, with extra cars parked everywhere. The same goes for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I like living here; if it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood sits right smack in the middle of the high desert, where dirt, dirt, and more dirt are all you see. Unless you've actually lived here, it's hard to understand what it feels like to always look at brown, except for the few lawns you see, which must cost a fortune to maintain. Back in the 90s, houses were spread out, but now it's the same, with a lot of new additions making it look more like a city every day. Sure, most places are changing, but this one's got its own charm. The locals are friendly, especially the old-timers, and the stores are mostly chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. You won't find Whole Foods or stores like that here; it takes a drive to get them. Construction jobs are the most common, likely because the city is still developing, with plenty of open spaces to build on. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and I love my job. Living here, we've adapted to the unique wildlife. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, always trying to catch them. Victorville offers fun things for families to do, like visiting the San Bernardino County Fair. You can also check out the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood and learn about the high desert's natural history and culture at the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I reckon my response is somewhat one of a kind. While others who answer this are likely homeowners leading their own lives, mine is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the people sharing my dormitory to be my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Nevertheless, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more traditional concepts. Just like any ordinary neighborhood, mine has houses, folks, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before we do, let's clarify the housing types in my area. There are three main types: apartments, personal houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, each room houses 2-4 individuals, with about 4-6 rooms per floor. Average occupancy per building is around 20 people. Then there are the actual houses, typically 2-4 bedrooms, mainly inhabited by alumni. These are fewer in number and less efficient. Lastly, there are dorm rooms, housing 100's of students, usually two sharing a room. This is the most common housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people. My school touts diversity, which is evident in the folks living in my neighborhood. Professional staff often live in the neighborhood houses, newer students in the dorms, and older students in the apartments. Describing the folks here does them no justice, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is practically a self-contained neighborhood, it boasts a wide range of stores and a single park. The stores offer dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, so anything needed can be found within the neighborhood's boundaries. The park is a playground for the diverse folks in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe by all its members!",
            "Well, I've been living here for about 10 years now, so I can share some insights. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a bit tough at first. I missed my old neighborhood, but my parents wanted the best for my sister and me. We found a better place to live, with a better high school and a housing situation that wasn't considered \"ghetto.\" It took some getting used to, but I made some friends and even some enemies in school. I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been great people, almost like family, and I truly appreciate them. I recall when I, my mom, dad, and sister went to Mr. Glen's wedding (he got re-married). It was a fun time, and I'm looking forward to giving my future wife the life of a queen someday. When Ms. Veda threw the flowers at the wedding, I caught the veil but not the flowers. We danced the night away, and I really enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of the daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but with my GPS, I can explore more. I've only gone so far, mainly when hanging out with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We loved playing video games and enjoying life. Sometimes I'd head to the park to find peace and calmness. I bring sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and use my bokken wooden sword if I can. I find it fun to do what I love. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a long time. My dad taught me tennis with Mr. Graves when I was a kid, and we always had a great time, even if it was tough. There are plenty of fun memories, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood, being adjacent to the college I attend, makes living here quite enjoyable. A mixture of apartment buildings, restaurants, and bars populate the area, with one bar having recently been renamed. While this bar is now more expensive, it offers decent service and drinks. The locals are generally nice, comprising mostly college students and lower-income residents due to the affordable rental prices. An elementary school nearby has led to a significant number of children in the area. I don't know my neighbors very well, and to be honest, I don't mind. Some of them smoke quite a bit of weed, which led the building's management to install an air freshener unit near their door. While this might seem funny to my boyfriend and me, it's somewhat insulting. The buildings around me generally look old, though some have been renovated on the inside. Further down the street are newer apartments, but I suspect their construction quality is subpar given their cheap rent. A small, affordable restaurant a five-minute walk from my place serves food on paper plates and uses a microwave for most of their dishes. Across from it is a gas station that isn't highly regarded, but thanks to recent city funding, the road has been improved with a large sidewalk and plenty of greenery, making the area somewhat nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps where some were cut down, but there are more trees here than on the road. Behind my complex lies another row of apartments. My street, 42nd, is relatively pleasant, but 43rd nearby is somewhat shabby, with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. While there's more greenery here to hide the buildings' appearances, it also tends to mask the higher crime rates, especially at an apartment complex on that street. However, I find the area affordable and convenient, with the university within walking distance and two bus stops nearby for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a cul-de-sac filled with duplexes that are randomly placed to appear like individual houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, making them look identical. Most duplexes are owned by friends, and we often gather at the end of the not pre-arranged driveway to chat while our kids play with their toys or fly kites. It's a refreshing change in this tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. The surroundings are beautiful—fields, trees, blue skies, and white fluffy clouds. However, this season, we've been facing tornado warnings. Last night, we heard actual sirens, so we took shelter. My smallest dog and I huddled in the bathtub with my purse and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop. We went from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sun came out, and it started to rain, forming a double rainbow. I snapped some pictures to share on Facebook. The streets were quiet for another hour before people started returning home. Then it was business as usual—moms and kids outside, dinner cooking. It's a welcoming neighborhood for this gal who just moved from NH to NC. I love the Southern accents. I live in a two-bed, two-bath apartment, as do most people here. Despite similar exteriors, interiors vary in size—some are quite small. I enjoy walking to the field behind my house and heading to the non-swimming pond. I've seen deer there, and in the morning, I can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a neighboring farm that brayes in the evening to let us know he's there. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right when I was about to start eighth grade. It was a bit tough making friends at first, but I eventually got close to someone two houses down and another guy on my street. Neither of them live here anymore, but the memories are still vivid. The same folks who were here when I first moved are largely still around. Our neighborhood is pretty much your average American suburban setup. Two-story houses are common, and every weekend, or whenever it's warm, you hear kids outside playing. Weekdays are generally quiet, but you're left alone unless you need help. I've never had any issues with the neighbors. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one snatched. You can trust your neighbors here. There's a park a couple of minutes away with a lot of memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood kids. I even have one bad memory from there – getting my nose elbowed during a football game, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I often go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're younger than me and still love playing on swings and slides. Just thinking about the park brings back so many memories. The neighborhood is diverse, with all kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But nowadays, a lot of people just use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. The stores in the area have everything you need. There are multiple dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're in the mood for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm really fond of this neighborhood. Reading about horror stories on social media and seeing the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a small, cozy town in South Carolina. It doesn't stand out much from other towns, but it's got a big impact on the local ag sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, and they're proud to show it off on the town's welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are spread out, usually two stories with metal or gray shingle roofs to beat the summer heat. They're not near the road, but further back so the front fields can be used for crops or animals. In the main part of town, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where the only stores are. There's fast food in the form of a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican place, and a small burger joint. A pizzeria closed down recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, best known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA, but many people prefer to shop at Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The most popular store is Dollar General, which is busy from morning till night. There's a small furniture store run by a friendly woman, Possibilities Furniture & More, and attached to it is a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Both a doctor's and vet's office are located away from the main town area. There's a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but middle and high school students have to go to the next town over. There's no parks yet, but they're working on a 2.5 acre recreational area. There isn't much to do; no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small you can miss it in a blink!",
            "The first time I heard about the neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit unexpected. Nearly every apartment was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard about this before, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it’s the everyday struggle. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, but we've learned how to be thrifty over the years. You start to enjoy the smell of old toys and worn-out clothes from the flea market. You can't smell as much in adulthood. You might start smoking, or you just get used to it. But the flea market always finds a way to get to you. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It gets stuck in the leather and stays even after you clean it. Over here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you’d never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or vehicles pass by, the store remains quiet. It’s a great place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there seem to be more and more people. Cars and people are flooding the city. They say it’s a developing city, with one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery hubs. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It’s not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don’t pry into anyone’s life here. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like waves on the beach. It’s an active place to be. With the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there’s always something going on. In a way, we have more of a community than a group of strangers. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I’m lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them mail and they return the favor. It's nice seeing them and I believe they appreciate my company as much as I do theirs. I live in an expansive, impersonal urban jungle, but it’s the people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven’t ruined my life completely.",
            "The area where I reside is a quintessential cookie-cutter suburb, with a noticeable emphasis on uniformity. Upon entering, the neatness is immediately apparent. Single-family homes, meticulously maintained, line the streets, all thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are consistent, with small grassy patches, decorative pebbles, and driveway space. The occasional tree adds a touch of nature. Every house boasts a two-car garage, and the roads are always smooth and free of potholes, a testament to the HOA's commitment to upkeep. Most homes are single-story, but some rise to two stories. Instead of the usual individual mailboxes, each household has a key to access their designated mailbox at a communal locker. There are also larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of the city, blending rural and suburban elements. We have a plenty of green spaces and community pools, open to all residents. Walking paths are also available for dog walks or leisure strolls. The area is known for its safety and community spirit, with a mix of retirees, middle-aged professionals, and young families. The city itself is both large and small-town-like, offering a range of amenities. A single mall provides grocery stores, from high-end organic options to budget-friendly outlets. It takes about 15 minutes to reach any significant location, followed by a variety of shopping choices. In summary, my neighborhood is safe, organized, and typical, with plenty of recreational amenities and easy access to shopping.",
            "I hail from a modest Midwestern town, nearly nestled in the suburbs of a large city. My immediate neighborhood, set on the eastern outskirts, is notably the most economically challenged area of town. Residences are largely rented or owned by folks with modest means, but it's not an unattractive place to live. Neighborhood vibes are friendly, with folks greeting you with a smile and a nod as you walk down the street. Crime rates here are slightly higher than other parts of town, with a few unfortunate incidents like shootings and a homicide occurring within a few blocks of my home. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting incident last year, but fortunately, my family has been spared direct victimization, aside from the occasional porch theft if we leave items out overnight. This town has been heavily impacted by the opioid crisis, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, numerous resources are available to combat the epidemic, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for those affected. Despite these challenges, there are many positive aspects. My son's elementary school is top-notch, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He thrives in an inclusive environment, having not faced bullying despite his special needs. The PTO organizes various events promoting family involvement and educational progress. To ensure no child goes hungry, the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, with no costs for fees, supplies, or field trips. Many city improvements have been made, but most have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where commercial activity is vibrant. The east side, where I live, tends to receive less attention, a point of contention for locals. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are excellent, there's a mix of shopping options, and while the value of our home is modest, it's comfortable and sufficient. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood brims with culture, nestled on a hilltop surrounded by buildings rich in history. I call home a 7-story apartment building right across from an old live theater, and just a block down is a quaint little arcade bar that draws various folks on warm summer nights. Weekends in June and July often find a line of people eager to enter. A few more blocks up is the nearest city park, quite spacious for the part of town it's in. Concrete steps encircle the park, with homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and stairs during winter. Rainy conditions make it hard to stay warm, but their proximity to the family center aids them in staying close by. What I admire about my city isn't the grandeur of historic landmarks or the architecture that dots the rolling hills leading to the ocean. It's the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence, and stories of federal crackdowns still echo three decades later. The people here work hard to clean up their neighborhood, despite its rough reputation. The adage, \"If you're white, don't walk around the Hill at night,\" still resonates, but I believe it stems from a past marred by social conditioning. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to seemingly fit in, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of its own, someone deeply aware of our nation's constant reminders of racism and cultural conditioning. No matter where I go, the Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive when I walk those streets at night, encountering folks who offer a jacket or a kind word faster than they'd steal from me. There are moments when I've huddled against storefronts on the greyest of nights, only to receive a $5 bill and praise for my beauty and worth from a stranger.",
            "Hey, I call this place home. Rural America, specifically small town Michigan, where fields meet tourist cities. Forget big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s here. You gotta drive for anything. But let me tell ya, I'm one of the luckiest folks alive, living surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are my neighbors, and every block has a beach. Middle America is alive and well here, with homes that aren't stacked like sardines. Mostly older homes, some with basements that you can see from the road, and older aluminum siding. The colors? Every color of the rainbow. And most yards? Trampolines, playsets, gardens, fences for the animals, and neighbors that know each other. The lawns, they're kept up, no fall leaves, and the bushes? Trimmed down. It's not over the top, but it's got that cozy, safe feeling. Safe enough that kids run up and down the streets, and neighbors wave and smile. Even the sheriff's department and health department are close by, and the county jail too. Recycling, baseball fields, and a small airport are all within walking distance. Ice cream? Just 8 blocks away. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, and we're close enough to downtown. It's not fancy, but it's perfect for raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. And you know what? It's the kind of place you drive into and think, \"Yeah, this is where I want to be.\""

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Since I live in a bustling metropolis, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are haphazardly interspersed with commercial sections, where a wide array of businesses operate, from offices to various stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. You name it, we've got it, with no shortage of new eateries or shops to explore. Some of these stores are famous, large-scale corporations, while others are trendy boutiques that line the streets, drawing in shoppers from otherwise quiet neighborhoods. There are even a couple of nearby parks where families with young children are often seen. The people who live here are just as diverse as the businesses and attractions. Just in one small area, we have a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish population, and a contingent of former Soviet Union refugees and immigrants. Just a few miles away, there are even more groups of various ethnicities, like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, among others. However, even a short 10-mile drive can take up to two hours due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours. Most people in the city don't walk around; cars are the primary mode of transportation. This leads to some of the worst traffic congestion in the world, making parking spots hard to come by. Ironically, the city has been experiencing a boom in construction, with numerous new apartment buildings going up. While it might seem like a popular place to live, many residents are wary of the increased population and traffic. The city offers a variety of housing options, from large apartment buildings to smaller homes and condominiums. Within my neighborhood alone, there's a mix of single-family homes, duplexes, and other types of residences. The age range of the residents is quite diverse as well, and to be honest, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not like the close-knit community I remember from my childhood, where I used to play with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends.",
            "My neighborhood is a patchwork of houses, some single-family and others split into two attached units. My home boasts a small front yard and a driveway to the left, reminiscent of the suburban dream that once captivated our country. That dream, though fading, still clings to us and to the neighborhood, calling upon us to hold onto it. The residents, while not as optimistic as they once were, still maintain a sense of community, with cars in every driveway and kids playing in the streets. The public school, standing for nearly a century, serves as a beacon of the future for the youth and a nostalgic reminder for the elders. The churches are sparse and often empty, but the basketball courts remain filled with activity. Each house carries its unique story, yet all feel the same. A large supermarket, 'Super A,' is run by a Yemeni family, possibly the sole Arab presence in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American, with the streets wide and filled with kids playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations, each with stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. A former karate school, now a pharmacy, serves as a reminder of the changing times, while a movie theater showcases old films, attracting the older crowd who appreciate the quiet escape. A single expressway runs through town, with entrances and exits in the neighboring town. A past petition for an exit in our town failed, as the youth's support was no match for the elders' resistance. The elders argued that it would ruin the town, and the city council agreed. A new high school is being constructed, and we are debating on a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin could best represent our town.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance – this residential area behind a shopping strip isn't what one would expect to find housing. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that only come alive during summer family reunions, you'll discover a thriving community. This neighborhood hides a collection of apartment complexes, stacked together like Russian nesting dolls, piecemeal and carefully placed in a line down the road. The first ones you'll see have been in the spotlight for some less-than-savory activities, so let's skip over them. The ones beside and beyond them, though, are a different story, almost completely unknown to the locals. Right across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus – a sleepy, quiet place where students come and go with coffee in hand, yawning as they start their days. The iron gates creak open, letting them in, while commuters grumble at the delay, especially on days when attendance is high. The road intersects with another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those who've met with unfortunate injuries on the other side. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a slow, lazy ceiling fan that stirs the hot, thick summer air. Children play in the park, doing cartwheels and stunts in the grass, while bees lazily buzz by in the nearby flower patches. Retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, exchanging nods with teens while eying the skateboarders warily. Beside the park, a strip mall houses a sushi place with affordable food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon nestled between them. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and chow down on hibachi chicken, all in one trip – the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where you'll often see teens with cold, toppings-covered cups, doing tricks on their skateboards and vaping. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana – a piece of history where time seems to stand still.",
            "Where is everything? she asked as we drove past the corn fields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she'd be blown away by the vast open landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her house—she'd never seen so much open space before. Overwhelmed by the corn fields, I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane highway, you'll reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it is the small development where I live. The houses are mostly made of brick and stucco, with each home boasting at least a half-acre of land that everyone takes pride in maintaining. In the spring, the annual flowers and midwestern trees change with each season. The driveways are filled with luxury Mercedes Benz cars that gleam in the sunlight after a good car wash. Continuing along the road towards my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He spends his days mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he's always genuine and has a unique history. Though he's aged and lost some of his wit, he was once a doctor and blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there's a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you'll hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. From building treehouses to \"hunting\" animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood kid to play with. The winters in my small town can be brutal, but there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become barren skeletons of bark. When snowfall blesses the town, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my sister and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We'd build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland, we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.",
            "Portland, Oregon, is a place that's known for its quirks and eccentricities, with the unofficial town slogan being \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This isn't just a throwback to the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, but a call to embrace a unique culture. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't just about being open to the unconventional; it's about taking things less seriously. We have yoga and hipsters, business professionals and families. In my neighborhood, you'll find colorful houses, gardens with flowers and herbs, and free boxes. These boxes contain treasures, sometimes clothes, books, or even other items, left by someone who no longer needs them. It's a magical experience walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood, but it's just one of many ways Portland's weirdness manifests. There are goat yoga classes and Timbers soccer matches, dreams pursued and dreams chased in bars. Portland has its issues, like drug and homelessness problems, but it's not afraid to face them head-on. The non-homeless population is divided between compassion and frustration, but that's not what makes Portland weird. That's just Portland being Portland.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence. They stand tall in the north, greeting the sun's rise and set with unwavering loyalty. No matter how absorbed I am with work or life, they remain steadfast and unshaken by life's challenges. On days when stress and anxiety overwhelm me, they call out to be seen, and with their silent strength, they offer solace and the resolve to keep moving forward, one day at a time. I first came to live here during my undergraduate years, and the mountains north of campus were the first to captivate me. While the university has its share of stunning sights in architecture, water, and greenery, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is beautiful, with countless cafes that have been the backdrop to many hours of caffeine-fueled studying. Just a short walk or bus ride from the campus, you're enveloped in an old-world charm that rivals that of the bustling, neighboring city. This blend of atmospheres, from the frenetic energy of the downtown area to the quiet serenity of the residential neighborhoods, creates a unique vibe that encourages exploration and discovery. Here, memories are forged, whether it's laughing with friends after an all-nighter past the rusted park swings or racing through the downtown to catch a movie in the fancy theater. Yet, the town also holds memories of hardship, as every place does in life. The ponds, in particular, have seen many a tear shed in the quiet of the night, reflecting on life's mysteries. As I walked past the pond and the park with its suburban homes, the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees, painting the sky a vibrant blue and yellow. As I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north, and there they were, as they always had been. The towering mountains dominated the hazy horizon, and with their silent, steadfast presence, they ignited a sense of resilience within me.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it. Public transit is super convenient, a staple of New York City living. Bensonhurt is quite urban, so it feels like you're right in the heart of NYC. Expect to see a plethora of Asian stores which have been popping up over the past couple of decades. Asian supermarkets and laundromats are abundant, known for their high-quality food and reasonable prices. In my area alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. It's not all Asian though; Bensonhurt is diverse, with immigrants and their American-born children living side by side. Many local businesses are Asian-owned, alongside a recently renovated park with multiple basketball courts, a large soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. The park is inclusive, welcoming people of all backgrounds. Corporate buildings are scarce; most homes are two-family houses. The residents are mostly friendly, but it can be noisy with cars blasting music and revving engines. At night, while Bensonhurt is generally safe, be cautious. You may encounter trouble-makers or package thieves. I've experienced physical assaults in the past, but that was years ago. Package thieves are common, and dog waste is a persistent issue. Despite the city's fine for not cleaning up after dogs, people often ignore it. Every morning, you'll find dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. It's a pet peeve of mine! Keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, there aren't many sidewalks, and the road goes downhill like a workout, leading people to call it the \"work out hill.\" Joggers love it for their daily runs. The street's condition isn't great; it's pitted and a bit dangerous to drive on. The wiring and power lines are tattered and need constant repair, especially after storms. There are tall evergreen trees everywhere, but locals don't like them; they cut down as many as possible to see the ocean. Many houses have large glass-fronted second stories to take in the view of the bay. The sunset is stunning, with the water lit from below and the sky turning orange, but the weather's often cloudy, and moss grows on everything due to the dampness. It's common to see cats chasing rabbits and dogs running in the streets. The school nearby means there are hardly any kids, but dogs are everywhere. Birds and the occasional hawk or eagle can be seen, and some restaurants serve fresh seafood along the waterfront, with rocks great for throwing into the water. The bay isn't wide, and you can see the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee, right at the crossroads of two state highways, which means I get a bit more traffic on my street than I'd prefer. Otherwise, it's a quiet neighborhood. There aren't many newcomers, so I'm pretty familiar with most of the folks that live around here. Everyone keeps busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we have sledding on the street, and since our house is at the corner, we see all the comings and goings throughout the day. We tend to take note of any unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs, and kids are out on their bikes. We're mostly home-based, with me, my wife, and our two daughters – aged eleven and fourteen – so everyone is used to seeing us around. We do enjoy outdoor activities, even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill on our back deck; the smell of barbecue always brings a pleasant atmosphere. From March until October, you can hear the lawn mowers nearly every day as the grass grows. The neighborhood has plenty of trees, originally a wooded area, which offers lots of shade. But that means we have to rake and burn leaves every Fall, which I actually enjoy as it signals the arrival of Fall. We've had minimal winter weather lately, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is quite rare. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quite quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees families visiting from out of town, with extra cars parked everywhere. The same goes for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I like living here; if it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood sits right smack in the middle of the high desert, where dirt, dirt, and more dirt are all you see. Unless you've actually lived here, it's hard to understand what it feels like to always look at brown, except for the few lawns you see, which must cost a fortune to maintain. Back in the 90s, houses were spread out, but now it's the same, with a lot of new additions making it look more like a city every day. Sure, most places are changing, but this one's got its own charm. The locals are friendly, especially the old-timers, and the stores are mostly chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. You won't find Whole Foods or stores like that here; it takes a drive to get them. Construction jobs are the most common, likely because the city is still developing, with plenty of open spaces to build on. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and I love my job. Living here, we've adapted to the unique wildlife. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, always trying to catch them. Victorville offers fun things for families to do, like visiting the San Bernardino County Fair. You can also check out the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood and learn about the high desert's natural history and culture at the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I reckon my response is somewhat one of a kind. While others who answer this are likely homeowners leading their own lives, mine is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the people sharing my dormitory to be my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Nevertheless, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more traditional concepts. Just like any ordinary neighborhood, mine has houses, folks, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before we do, let's clarify the housing types in my area. There are three main types: apartments, personal houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, each room houses 2-4 individuals, with about 4-6 rooms per floor. Average occupancy per building is around 20 people. Then there are the actual houses, typically 2-4 bedrooms, mainly inhabited by alumni. These are fewer in number and less efficient. Lastly, there are dorm rooms, housing 100's of students, usually two sharing a room. This is the most common housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people. My school touts diversity, which is evident in the folks living in my neighborhood. Professional staff often live in the neighborhood houses, newer students in the dorms, and older students in the apartments. Describing the folks here does them no justice, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is practically a self-contained neighborhood, it boasts a wide range of stores and a single park. The stores offer dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, so anything needed can be found within the neighborhood's boundaries. The park is a playground for the diverse folks in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe by all its members!",
            "Well, I've been living here for about 10 years now, so I can share some insights. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a bit tough at first. I missed my old neighborhood, but my parents wanted the best for my sister and me. We found a better place to live, with a better high school and a housing situation that wasn't considered \"ghetto.\" It took some getting used to, but I made some friends and even some enemies in school. I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been great people, almost like family, and I truly appreciate them. I recall when I, my mom, dad, and sister went to Mr. Glen's wedding (he got re-married). It was a fun time, and I'm looking forward to giving my future wife the life of a queen someday. When Ms. Veda threw the flowers at the wedding, I caught the veil but not the flowers. We danced the night away, and I really enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of the daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but with my GPS, I can explore more. I've only gone so far, mainly when hanging out with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We loved playing video games and enjoying life. Sometimes I'd head to the park to find peace and calmness. I bring sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and use my bokken wooden sword if I can. I find it fun to do what I love. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a long time. My dad taught me tennis with Mr. Graves when I was a kid, and we always had a great time, even if it was tough. There are plenty of fun memories, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood, being adjacent to the college I attend, makes living here quite enjoyable. A mixture of apartment buildings, restaurants, and bars populate the area, with one bar having recently been renamed. While this bar is now more expensive, it offers decent service and drinks. The locals are generally nice, comprising mostly college students and lower-income residents due to the affordable rental prices. An elementary school nearby has led to a significant number of children in the area. I don't know my neighbors very well, and to be honest, I don't mind. Some of them smoke quite a bit of weed, which led the building's management to install an air freshener unit near their door. While this might seem funny to my boyfriend and me, it's somewhat insulting. The buildings around me generally look old, though some have been renovated on the inside. Further down the street are newer apartments, but I suspect their construction quality is subpar given their cheap rent. A small, affordable restaurant a five-minute walk from my place serves food on paper plates and uses a microwave for most of their dishes. Across from it is a gas station that isn't highly regarded, but thanks to recent city funding, the road has been improved with a large sidewalk and plenty of greenery, making the area somewhat nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps where some were cut down, but there are more trees here than on the road. Behind my complex lies another row of apartments. My street, 42nd, is relatively pleasant, but 43rd nearby is somewhat shabby, with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. While there's more greenery here to hide the buildings' appearances, it also tends to mask the higher crime rates, especially at an apartment complex on that street. However, I find the area affordable and convenient, with the university within walking distance and two bus stops nearby for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a cul-de-sac filled with duplexes that are randomly placed to appear like individual houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, making them look identical. Most duplexes are owned by friends, and we often gather at the end of the not pre-arranged driveway to chat while our kids play with their toys or fly kites. It's a refreshing change in this tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. The surroundings are beautiful—fields, trees, blue skies, and white fluffy clouds. However, this season, we've been facing tornado warnings. Last night, we heard actual sirens, so we took shelter. My smallest dog and I huddled in the bathtub with my purse and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop. We went from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sun came out, and it started to rain, forming a double rainbow. I snapped some pictures to share on Facebook. The streets were quiet for another hour before people started returning home. Then it was business as usual—moms and kids outside, dinner cooking. It's a welcoming neighborhood for this gal who just moved from NH to NC. I love the Southern accents. I live in a two-bed, two-bath apartment, as do most people here. Despite similar exteriors, interiors vary in size—some are quite small. I enjoy walking to the field behind my house and heading to the non-swimming pond. I've seen deer there, and in the morning, I can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a neighboring farm that brayes in the evening to let us know he's there. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right when I was about to start eighth grade. It was a bit tough making friends at first, but I eventually got close to someone two houses down and another guy on my street. Neither of them live here anymore, but the memories are still vivid. The same folks who were here when I first moved are largely still around. Our neighborhood is pretty much your average American suburban setup. Two-story houses are common, and every weekend, or whenever it's warm, you hear kids outside playing. Weekdays are generally quiet, but you're left alone unless you need help. I've never had any issues with the neighbors. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one snatched. You can trust your neighbors here. There's a park a couple of minutes away with a lot of memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood kids. I even have one bad memory from there – getting my nose elbowed during a football game, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I often go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're younger than me and still love playing on swings and slides. Just thinking about the park brings back so many memories. The neighborhood is diverse, with all kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But nowadays, a lot of people just use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. The stores in the area have everything you need. There are multiple dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're in the mood for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm really fond of this neighborhood. Reading about horror stories on social media and seeing the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a small, cozy town in South Carolina. It doesn't stand out much from other towns, but it's got a big impact on the local ag sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, and they're proud to show it off on the town's welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are spread out, usually two stories with metal or gray shingle roofs to beat the summer heat. They're not near the road, but further back so the front fields can be used for crops or animals. In the main part of town, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where the only stores are. There's fast food in the form of a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican place, and a small burger joint. A pizzeria closed down recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, best known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA, but many people prefer to shop at Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The most popular store is Dollar General, which is busy from morning till night. There's a small furniture store run by a friendly woman, Possibilities Furniture & More, and attached to it is a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Both a doctor's and vet's office are located away from the main town area. There's a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but middle and high school students have to go to the next town over. There's no parks yet, but they're working on a 2.5 acre recreational area. There isn't much to do; no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small you can miss it in a blink!",
            "The first time I heard about the neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit unexpected. Nearly every apartment was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard about this before, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it’s the everyday struggle. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, but we've learned how to be thrifty over the years. You start to enjoy the smell of old toys and worn-out clothes from the flea market. You can't smell as much in adulthood. You might start smoking, or you just get used to it. But the flea market always finds a way to get to you. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It gets stuck in the leather and stays even after you clean it. Over here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you’d never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or vehicles pass by, the store remains quiet. It’s a great place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there seem to be more and more people. Cars and people are flooding the city. They say it’s a developing city, with one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery hubs. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It’s not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don’t pry into anyone’s life here. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like waves on the beach. It’s an active place to be. With the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there’s always something going on. In a way, we have more of a community than a group of strangers. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I’m lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them mail and they return the favor. It's nice seeing them and I believe they appreciate my company as much as I do theirs. I live in an expansive, impersonal urban jungle, but it’s the people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven’t ruined my life completely.",
            "The area where I reside is a quintessential cookie-cutter suburb, with a noticeable emphasis on uniformity. Upon entering, the neatness is immediately apparent. Single-family homes, meticulously maintained, line the streets, all thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are consistent, with small grassy patches, decorative pebbles, and driveway space. The occasional tree adds a touch of nature. Every house boasts a two-car garage, and the roads are always smooth and free of potholes, a testament to the HOA's commitment to upkeep. Most homes are single-story, but some rise to two stories. Instead of the usual individual mailboxes, each household has a key to access their designated mailbox at a communal locker. There are also larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of the city, blending rural and suburban elements. We have a plenty of green spaces and community pools, open to all residents. Walking paths are also available for dog walks or leisure strolls. The area is known for its safety and community spirit, with a mix of retirees, middle-aged professionals, and young families. The city itself is both large and small-town-like, offering a range of amenities. A single mall provides grocery stores, from high-end organic options to budget-friendly outlets. It takes about 15 minutes to reach any significant location, followed by a variety of shopping choices. In summary, my neighborhood is safe, organized, and typical, with plenty of recreational amenities and easy access to shopping.",
            "I hail from a modest Midwestern town, nearly nestled in the suburbs of a large city. My immediate neighborhood, set on the eastern outskirts, is notably the most economically challenged area of town. Residences are largely rented or owned by folks with modest means, but it's not an unattractive place to live. Neighborhood vibes are friendly, with folks greeting you with a smile and a nod as you walk down the street. Crime rates here are slightly higher than other parts of town, with a few unfortunate incidents like shootings and a homicide occurring within a few blocks of my home. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting incident last year, but fortunately, my family has been spared direct victimization, aside from the occasional porch theft if we leave items out overnight. This town has been heavily impacted by the opioid crisis, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, numerous resources are available to combat the epidemic, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for those affected. Despite these challenges, there are many positive aspects. My son's elementary school is top-notch, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He thrives in an inclusive environment, having not faced bullying despite his special needs. The PTO organizes various events promoting family involvement and educational progress. To ensure no child goes hungry, the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, with no costs for fees, supplies, or field trips. Many city improvements have been made, but most have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where commercial activity is vibrant. The east side, where I live, tends to receive less attention, a point of contention for locals. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are excellent, there's a mix of shopping options, and while the value of our home is modest, it's comfortable and sufficient. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood brims with culture, nestled on a hilltop surrounded by buildings rich in history. I call home a 7-story apartment building right across from an old live theater, and just a block down is a quaint little arcade bar that draws various folks on warm summer nights. Weekends in June and July often find a line of people eager to enter. A few more blocks up is the nearest city park, quite spacious for the part of town it's in. Concrete steps encircle the park, with homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and stairs during winter. Rainy conditions make it hard to stay warm, but their proximity to the family center aids them in staying close by. What I admire about my city isn't the grandeur of historic landmarks or the architecture that dots the rolling hills leading to the ocean. It's the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence, and stories of federal crackdowns still echo three decades later. The people here work hard to clean up their neighborhood, despite its rough reputation. The adage, \"If you're white, don't walk around the Hill at night,\" still resonates, but I believe it stems from a past marred by social conditioning. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to seemingly fit in, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of its own, someone deeply aware of our nation's constant reminders of racism and cultural conditioning. No matter where I go, the Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive when I walk those streets at night, encountering folks who offer a jacket or a kind word faster than they'd steal from me. There are moments when I've huddled against storefronts on the greyest of nights, only to receive a $5 bill and praise for my beauty and worth from a stranger.",
            "Hey, I call this place home. Rural America, specifically small town Michigan, where fields meet tourist cities. Forget big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s here. You gotta drive for anything. But let me tell ya, I'm one of the luckiest folks alive, living surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are my neighbors, and every block has a beach. Middle America is alive and well here, with homes that aren't stacked like sardines. Mostly older homes, some with basements that you can see from the road, and older aluminum siding. The colors? Every color of the rainbow. And most yards? Trampolines, playsets, gardens, fences for the animals, and neighbors that know each other. The lawns, they're kept up, no fall leaves, and the bushes? Trimmed down. It's not over the top, but it's got that cozy, safe feeling. Safe enough that kids run up and down the streets, and neighbors wave and smile. Even the sheriff's department and health department are close by, and the county jail too. Recycling, baseball fields, and a small airport are all within walking distance. Ice cream? Just 8 blocks away. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, and we're close enough to downtown. It's not fancy, but it's perfect for raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. And you know what? It's the kind of place you drive into and think, \"Yeah, this is where I want to be.\""

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Since I live in a bustling metropolis, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are haphazardly interspersed with commercial sections, where a wide array of businesses operate, from offices to various stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. You name it, we've got it, with no shortage of new eateries or shops to explore. Some of these stores are famous, large-scale corporations, while others are trendy boutiques that line the streets, drawing in shoppers from otherwise quiet neighborhoods. There are even a couple of nearby parks where families with young children are often seen. The people who live here are just as diverse as the businesses and attractions. Just in one small area, we have a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish population, and a contingent of former Soviet Union refugees and immigrants. Just a few miles away, there are even more groups of various ethnicities, like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, among others. However, even a short 10-mile drive can take up to two hours due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours. Most people in the city don't walk around; cars are the primary mode of transportation. This leads to some of the worst traffic congestion in the world, making parking spots hard to come by. Ironically, the city has been experiencing a boom in construction, with numerous new apartment buildings going up. While it might seem like a popular place to live, many residents are wary of the increased population and traffic. The city offers a variety of housing options, from large apartment buildings to smaller homes and condominiums. Within my neighborhood alone, there's a mix of single-family homes, duplexes, and other types of residences. The age range of the residents is quite diverse as well, and to be honest, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not like the close-knit community I remember from my childhood, where I used to play with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends.",
            "My neighborhood is a patchwork of houses, some single-family and others split into two attached units. My home boasts a small front yard and a driveway to the left, reminiscent of the suburban dream that once captivated our country. That dream, though fading, still clings to us and to the neighborhood, calling upon us to hold onto it. The residents, while not as optimistic as they once were, still maintain a sense of community, with cars in every driveway and kids playing in the streets. The public school, standing for nearly a century, serves as a beacon of the future for the youth and a nostalgic reminder for the elders. The churches are sparse and often empty, but the basketball courts remain filled with activity. Each house carries its unique story, yet all feel the same. A large supermarket, 'Super A,' is run by a Yemeni family, possibly the sole Arab presence in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American, with the streets wide and filled with kids playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations, each with stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. A former karate school, now a pharmacy, serves as a reminder of the changing times, while a movie theater showcases old films, attracting the older crowd who appreciate the quiet escape. A single expressway runs through town, with entrances and exits in the neighboring town. A past petition for an exit in our town failed, as the youth's support was no match for the elders' resistance. The elders argued that it would ruin the town, and the city council agreed. A new high school is being constructed, and we are debating on a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin could best represent our town.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance – this residential area behind a shopping strip isn't what one would expect to find housing. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that only come alive during summer family reunions, you'll discover a thriving community. This neighborhood hides a collection of apartment complexes, stacked together like Russian nesting dolls, piecemeal and carefully placed in a line down the road. The first ones you'll see have been in the spotlight for some less-than-savory activities, so let's skip over them. The ones beside and beyond them, though, are a different story, almost completely unknown to the locals. Right across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus – a sleepy, quiet place where students come and go with coffee in hand, yawning as they start their days. The iron gates creak open, letting them in, while commuters grumble at the delay, especially on days when attendance is high. The road intersects with another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those who've met with unfortunate injuries on the other side. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a slow, lazy ceiling fan that stirs the hot, thick summer air. Children play in the park, doing cartwheels and stunts in the grass, while bees lazily buzz by in the nearby flower patches. Retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, exchanging nods with teens while eying the skateboarders warily. Beside the park, a strip mall houses a sushi place with affordable food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon nestled between them. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and chow down on hibachi chicken, all in one trip – the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where you'll often see teens with cold, toppings-covered cups, doing tricks on their skateboards and vaping. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana – a piece of history where time seems to stand still.",
            "Where is everything? she asked as we drove past the corn fields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she'd be blown away by the vast open landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her house—she'd never seen so much open space before. Overwhelmed by the corn fields, I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane highway, you'll reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it is the small development where I live. The houses are mostly made of brick and stucco, with each home boasting at least a half-acre of land that everyone takes pride in maintaining. In the spring, the annual flowers and midwestern trees change with each season. The driveways are filled with luxury Mercedes Benz cars that gleam in the sunlight after a good car wash. Continuing along the road towards my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He spends his days mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he's always genuine and has a unique history. Though he's aged and lost some of his wit, he was once a doctor and blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there's a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you'll hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. From building treehouses to \"hunting\" animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood kid to play with. The winters in my small town can be brutal, but there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become barren skeletons of bark. When snowfall blesses the town, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my sister and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We'd build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland, we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.",
            "Portland, Oregon, is a place that's known for its quirks and eccentricities, with the unofficial town slogan being \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This isn't just a throwback to the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, but a call to embrace a unique culture. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't just about being open to the unconventional; it's about taking things less seriously. We have yoga and hipsters, business professionals and families. In my neighborhood, you'll find colorful houses, gardens with flowers and herbs, and free boxes. These boxes contain treasures, sometimes clothes, books, or even other items, left by someone who no longer needs them. It's a magical experience walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood, but it's just one of many ways Portland's weirdness manifests. There are goat yoga classes and Timbers soccer matches, dreams pursued and dreams chased in bars. Portland has its issues, like drug and homelessness problems, but it's not afraid to face them head-on. The non-homeless population is divided between compassion and frustration, but that's not what makes Portland weird. That's just Portland being Portland.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence. They stand tall in the north, greeting the sun's rise and set with unwavering loyalty. No matter how absorbed I am with work or life, they remain steadfast and unshaken by life's challenges. On days when stress and anxiety overwhelm me, they call out to be seen, and with their silent strength, they offer solace and the resolve to keep moving forward, one day at a time. I first came to live here during my undergraduate years, and the mountains north of campus were the first to captivate me. While the university has its share of stunning sights in architecture, water, and greenery, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is beautiful, with countless cafes that have been the backdrop to many hours of caffeine-fueled studying. Just a short walk or bus ride from the campus, you're enveloped in an old-world charm that rivals that of the bustling, neighboring city. This blend of atmospheres, from the frenetic energy of the downtown area to the quiet serenity of the residential neighborhoods, creates a unique vibe that encourages exploration and discovery. Here, memories are forged, whether it's laughing with friends after an all-nighter past the rusted park swings or racing through the downtown to catch a movie in the fancy theater. Yet, the town also holds memories of hardship, as every place does in life. The ponds, in particular, have seen many a tear shed in the quiet of the night, reflecting on life's mysteries. As I walked past the pond and the park with its suburban homes, the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees, painting the sky a vibrant blue and yellow. As I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north, and there they were, as they always had been. The towering mountains dominated the hazy horizon, and with their silent, steadfast presence, they ignited a sense of resilience within me.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it. Public transit is super convenient, a staple of New York City living. Bensonhurt is quite urban, so it feels like you're right in the heart of NYC. Expect to see a plethora of Asian stores which have been popping up over the past couple of decades. Asian supermarkets and laundromats are abundant, known for their high-quality food and reasonable prices. In my area alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. It's not all Asian though; Bensonhurt is diverse, with immigrants and their American-born children living side by side. Many local businesses are Asian-owned, alongside a recently renovated park with multiple basketball courts, a large soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. The park is inclusive, welcoming people of all backgrounds. Corporate buildings are scarce; most homes are two-family houses. The residents are mostly friendly, but it can be noisy with cars blasting music and revving engines. At night, while Bensonhurt is generally safe, be cautious. You may encounter trouble-makers or package thieves. I've experienced physical assaults in the past, but that was years ago. Package thieves are common, and dog waste is a persistent issue. Despite the city's fine for not cleaning up after dogs, people often ignore it. Every morning, you'll find dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. It's a pet peeve of mine! Keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, there aren't many sidewalks, and the road goes downhill like a workout, leading people to call it the \"work out hill.\" Joggers love it for their daily runs. The street's condition isn't great; it's pitted and a bit dangerous to drive on. The wiring and power lines are tattered and need constant repair, especially after storms. There are tall evergreen trees everywhere, but locals don't like them; they cut down as many as possible to see the ocean. Many houses have large glass-fronted second stories to take in the view of the bay. The sunset is stunning, with the water lit from below and the sky turning orange, but the weather's often cloudy, and moss grows on everything due to the dampness. It's common to see cats chasing rabbits and dogs running in the streets. The school nearby means there are hardly any kids, but dogs are everywhere. Birds and the occasional hawk or eagle can be seen, and some restaurants serve fresh seafood along the waterfront, with rocks great for throwing into the water. The bay isn't wide, and you can see the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee, right at the crossroads of two state highways, which means I get a bit more traffic on my street than I'd prefer. Otherwise, it's a quiet neighborhood. There aren't many newcomers, so I'm pretty familiar with most of the folks that live around here. Everyone keeps busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we have sledding on the street, and since our house is at the corner, we see all the comings and goings throughout the day. We tend to take note of any unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs, and kids are out on their bikes. We're mostly home-based, with me, my wife, and our two daughters – aged eleven and fourteen – so everyone is used to seeing us around. We do enjoy outdoor activities, even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill on our back deck; the smell of barbecue always brings a pleasant atmosphere. From March until October, you can hear the lawn mowers nearly every day as the grass grows. The neighborhood has plenty of trees, originally a wooded area, which offers lots of shade. But that means we have to rake and burn leaves every Fall, which I actually enjoy as it signals the arrival of Fall. We've had minimal winter weather lately, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is quite rare. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quite quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees families visiting from out of town, with extra cars parked everywhere. The same goes for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I like living here; if it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood sits right smack in the middle of the high desert, where dirt, dirt, and more dirt are all you see. Unless you've actually lived here, it's hard to understand what it feels like to always look at brown, except for the few lawns you see, which must cost a fortune to maintain. Back in the 90s, houses were spread out, but now it's the same, with a lot of new additions making it look more like a city every day. Sure, most places are changing, but this one's got its own charm. The locals are friendly, especially the old-timers, and the stores are mostly chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. You won't find Whole Foods or stores like that here; it takes a drive to get them. Construction jobs are the most common, likely because the city is still developing, with plenty of open spaces to build on. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and I love my job. Living here, we've adapted to the unique wildlife. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, always trying to catch them. Victorville offers fun things for families to do, like visiting the San Bernardino County Fair. You can also check out the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood and learn about the high desert's natural history and culture at the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I reckon my response is somewhat one of a kind. While others who answer this are likely homeowners leading their own lives, mine is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the people sharing my dormitory to be my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Nevertheless, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more traditional concepts. Just like any ordinary neighborhood, mine has houses, folks, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before we do, let's clarify the housing types in my area. There are three main types: apartments, personal houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, each room houses 2-4 individuals, with about 4-6 rooms per floor. Average occupancy per building is around 20 people. Then there are the actual houses, typically 2-4 bedrooms, mainly inhabited by alumni. These are fewer in number and less efficient. Lastly, there are dorm rooms, housing 100's of students, usually two sharing a room. This is the most common housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people. My school touts diversity, which is evident in the folks living in my neighborhood. Professional staff often live in the neighborhood houses, newer students in the dorms, and older students in the apartments. Describing the folks here does them no justice, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is practically a self-contained neighborhood, it boasts a wide range of stores and a single park. The stores offer dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, so anything needed can be found within the neighborhood's boundaries. The park is a playground for the diverse folks in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe by all its members!",
            "Well, I've been living here for about 10 years now, so I can share some insights. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a bit tough at first. I missed my old neighborhood, but my parents wanted the best for my sister and me. We found a better place to live, with a better high school and a housing situation that wasn't considered \"ghetto.\" It took some getting used to, but I made some friends and even some enemies in school. I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been great people, almost like family, and I truly appreciate them. I recall when I, my mom, dad, and sister went to Mr. Glen's wedding (he got re-married). It was a fun time, and I'm looking forward to giving my future wife the life of a queen someday. When Ms. Veda threw the flowers at the wedding, I caught the veil but not the flowers. We danced the night away, and I really enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of the daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but with my GPS, I can explore more. I've only gone so far, mainly when hanging out with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We loved playing video games and enjoying life. Sometimes I'd head to the park to find peace and calmness. I bring sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and use my bokken wooden sword if I can. I find it fun to do what I love. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a long time. My dad taught me tennis with Mr. Graves when I was a kid, and we always had a great time, even if it was tough. There are plenty of fun memories, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood, being adjacent to the college I attend, makes living here quite enjoyable. A mixture of apartment buildings, restaurants, and bars populate the area, with one bar having recently been renamed. While this bar is now more expensive, it offers decent service and drinks. The locals are generally nice, comprising mostly college students and lower-income residents due to the affordable rental prices. An elementary school nearby has led to a significant number of children in the area. I don't know my neighbors very well, and to be honest, I don't mind. Some of them smoke quite a bit of weed, which led the building's management to install an air freshener unit near their door. While this might seem funny to my boyfriend and me, it's somewhat insulting. The buildings around me generally look old, though some have been renovated on the inside. Further down the street are newer apartments, but I suspect their construction quality is subpar given their cheap rent. A small, affordable restaurant a five-minute walk from my place serves food on paper plates and uses a microwave for most of their dishes. Across from it is a gas station that isn't highly regarded, but thanks to recent city funding, the road has been improved with a large sidewalk and plenty of greenery, making the area somewhat nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps where some were cut down, but there are more trees here than on the road. Behind my complex lies another row of apartments. My street, 42nd, is relatively pleasant, but 43rd nearby is somewhat shabby, with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. While there's more greenery here to hide the buildings' appearances, it also tends to mask the higher crime rates, especially at an apartment complex on that street. However, I find the area affordable and convenient, with the university within walking distance and two bus stops nearby for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a cul-de-sac filled with duplexes that are randomly placed to appear like individual houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, making them look identical. Most duplexes are owned by friends, and we often gather at the end of the not pre-arranged driveway to chat while our kids play with their toys or fly kites. It's a refreshing change in this tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. The surroundings are beautiful—fields, trees, blue skies, and white fluffy clouds. However, this season, we've been facing tornado warnings. Last night, we heard actual sirens, so we took shelter. My smallest dog and I huddled in the bathtub with my purse and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop. We went from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sun came out, and it started to rain, forming a double rainbow. I snapped some pictures to share on Facebook. The streets were quiet for another hour before people started returning home. Then it was business as usual—moms and kids outside, dinner cooking. It's a welcoming neighborhood for this gal who just moved from NH to NC. I love the Southern accents. I live in a two-bed, two-bath apartment, as do most people here. Despite similar exteriors, interiors vary in size—some are quite small. I enjoy walking to the field behind my house and heading to the non-swimming pond. I've seen deer there, and in the morning, I can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a neighboring farm that brayes in the evening to let us know he's there. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right when I was about to start eighth grade. It was a bit tough making friends at first, but I eventually got close to someone two houses down and another guy on my street. Neither of them live here anymore, but the memories are still vivid. The same folks who were here when I first moved are largely still around. Our neighborhood is pretty much your average American suburban setup. Two-story houses are common, and every weekend, or whenever it's warm, you hear kids outside playing. Weekdays are generally quiet, but you're left alone unless you need help. I've never had any issues with the neighbors. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one snatched. You can trust your neighbors here. There's a park a couple of minutes away with a lot of memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood kids. I even have one bad memory from there – getting my nose elbowed during a football game, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I often go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're younger than me and still love playing on swings and slides. Just thinking about the park brings back so many memories. The neighborhood is diverse, with all kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But nowadays, a lot of people just use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. The stores in the area have everything you need. There are multiple dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're in the mood for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm really fond of this neighborhood. Reading about horror stories on social media and seeing the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a small, cozy town in South Carolina. It doesn't stand out much from other towns, but it's got a big impact on the local ag sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, and they're proud to show it off on the town's welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are spread out, usually two stories with metal or gray shingle roofs to beat the summer heat. They're not near the road, but further back so the front fields can be used for crops or animals. In the main part of town, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where the only stores are. There's fast food in the form of a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican place, and a small burger joint. A pizzeria closed down recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, best known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA, but many people prefer to shop at Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The most popular store is Dollar General, which is busy from morning till night. There's a small furniture store run by a friendly woman, Possibilities Furniture & More, and attached to it is a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Both a doctor's and vet's office are located away from the main town area. There's a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but middle and high school students have to go to the next town over. There's no parks yet, but they're working on a 2.5 acre recreational area. There isn't much to do; no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small you can miss it in a blink!",
            "The first time I heard about the neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit unexpected. Nearly every apartment was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard about this before, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it’s the everyday struggle. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, but we've learned how to be thrifty over the years. You start to enjoy the smell of old toys and worn-out clothes from the flea market. You can't smell as much in adulthood. You might start smoking, or you just get used to it. But the flea market always finds a way to get to you. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It gets stuck in the leather and stays even after you clean it. Over here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you’d never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or vehicles pass by, the store remains quiet. It’s a great place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there seem to be more and more people. Cars and people are flooding the city. They say it’s a developing city, with one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery hubs. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It’s not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don’t pry into anyone’s life here. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like waves on the beach. It’s an active place to be. With the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there’s always something going on. In a way, we have more of a community than a group of strangers. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I’m lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them mail and they return the favor. It's nice seeing them and I believe they appreciate my company as much as I do theirs. I live in an expansive, impersonal urban jungle, but it’s the people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven’t ruined my life completely.",
            "The area where I reside is a quintessential cookie-cutter suburb, with a noticeable emphasis on uniformity. Upon entering, the neatness is immediately apparent. Single-family homes, meticulously maintained, line the streets, all thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are consistent, with small grassy patches, decorative pebbles, and driveway space. The occasional tree adds a touch of nature. Every house boasts a two-car garage, and the roads are always smooth and free of potholes, a testament to the HOA's commitment to upkeep. Most homes are single-story, but some rise to two stories. Instead of the usual individual mailboxes, each household has a key to access their designated mailbox at a communal locker. There are also larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of the city, blending rural and suburban elements. We have a plenty of green spaces and community pools, open to all residents. Walking paths are also available for dog walks or leisure strolls. The area is known for its safety and community spirit, with a mix of retirees, middle-aged professionals, and young families. The city itself is both large and small-town-like, offering a range of amenities. A single mall provides grocery stores, from high-end organic options to budget-friendly outlets. It takes about 15 minutes to reach any significant location, followed by a variety of shopping choices. In summary, my neighborhood is safe, organized, and typical, with plenty of recreational amenities and easy access to shopping.",
            "I hail from a modest Midwestern town, nearly nestled in the suburbs of a large city. My immediate neighborhood, set on the eastern outskirts, is notably the most economically challenged area of town. Residences are largely rented or owned by folks with modest means, but it's not an unattractive place to live. Neighborhood vibes are friendly, with folks greeting you with a smile and a nod as you walk down the street. Crime rates here are slightly higher than other parts of town, with a few unfortunate incidents like shootings and a homicide occurring within a few blocks of my home. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting incident last year, but fortunately, my family has been spared direct victimization, aside from the occasional porch theft if we leave items out overnight. This town has been heavily impacted by the opioid crisis, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, numerous resources are available to combat the epidemic, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for those affected. Despite these challenges, there are many positive aspects. My son's elementary school is top-notch, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He thrives in an inclusive environment, having not faced bullying despite his special needs. The PTO organizes various events promoting family involvement and educational progress. To ensure no child goes hungry, the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, with no costs for fees, supplies, or field trips. Many city improvements have been made, but most have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where commercial activity is vibrant. The east side, where I live, tends to receive less attention, a point of contention for locals. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are excellent, there's a mix of shopping options, and while the value of our home is modest, it's comfortable and sufficient. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood brims with culture, nestled on a hilltop surrounded by buildings rich in history. I call home a 7-story apartment building right across from an old live theater, and just a block down is a quaint little arcade bar that draws various folks on warm summer nights. Weekends in June and July often find a line of people eager to enter. A few more blocks up is the nearest city park, quite spacious for the part of town it's in. Concrete steps encircle the park, with homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and stairs during winter. Rainy conditions make it hard to stay warm, but their proximity to the family center aids them in staying close by. What I admire about my city isn't the grandeur of historic landmarks or the architecture that dots the rolling hills leading to the ocean. It's the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence, and stories of federal crackdowns still echo three decades later. The people here work hard to clean up their neighborhood, despite its rough reputation. The adage, \"If you're white, don't walk around the Hill at night,\" still resonates, but I believe it stems from a past marred by social conditioning. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to seemingly fit in, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of its own, someone deeply aware of our nation's constant reminders of racism and cultural conditioning. No matter where I go, the Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive when I walk those streets at night, encountering folks who offer a jacket or a kind word faster than they'd steal from me. There are moments when I've huddled against storefronts on the greyest of nights, only to receive a $5 bill and praise for my beauty and worth from a stranger.",
            "Hey, I call this place home. Rural America, specifically small town Michigan, where fields meet tourist cities. Forget big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s here. You gotta drive for anything. But let me tell ya, I'm one of the luckiest folks alive, living surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are my neighbors, and every block has a beach. Middle America is alive and well here, with homes that aren't stacked like sardines. Mostly older homes, some with basements that you can see from the road, and older aluminum siding. The colors? Every color of the rainbow. And most yards? Trampolines, playsets, gardens, fences for the animals, and neighbors that know each other. The lawns, they're kept up, no fall leaves, and the bushes? Trimmed down. It's not over the top, but it's got that cozy, safe feeling. Safe enough that kids run up and down the streets, and neighbors wave and smile. Even the sheriff's department and health department are close by, and the county jail too. Recycling, baseball fields, and a small airport are all within walking distance. Ice cream? Just 8 blocks away. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, and we're close enough to downtown. It's not fancy, but it's perfect for raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. And you know what? It's the kind of place you drive into and think, \"Yeah, this is where I want to be.\""

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city is a melting pot of diversity. Neighborhoods are scattered between commercial areas, where all sorts of businesses thrive. Offices, stores, and restaurants galore, some big-name brands, some small boutiques. They're everywhere, even in quiet neighborhoods, making them no longer so serene. Parks abound, and people love bringing their children there. The folks here are diverse too. In one area, there's a strong LGBTQ+, Orthodox Jewish, and Soviet refugee community. Step outside, and you'll find more races and origins. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, they're just miles away, but those miles can be long and congested. Traffic's a nightmare, and parking? Forget about it. Yet, new apartment buildings are popping up everywhere. It's a hot spot, but residents are grumpy about more people and cars. Houses come in all shapes and sizes, from single-family homes to condos. There's even a mix of ages in the neighborhood, but I barely know my neighbors. It's not a tight-knit community anymore, but I have fond memories of playing with my childhood friends.",
            "My neighborhood is quite unique. Most houses are single-family homes, but you'll find a few that have been divided into two, while still being attached to each other, if you catch my drift. My house boasts a small yard in front and a driveway to the left. It, like many others, is a reminder of a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream. While that dream seems to be waning, our neighborhood and many others like it still stand, still clinging to it as best we can. The people here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the yards aren't as well-maintained, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the kids play as if the world revolves around them. The local school, standing tall for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always filled with kids. The homes may look different, but they all feel the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and the kids play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many residents have lived here for generations, and they've got stories to tell about a time when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school once, but when Hollywood stopped making karate movies, the kids lost interest, so it became a pharmacy. “Drugs make everything better,” I’ve heard. There's also an old movie theater that shows classic films at a discount, shunned by the youth but loved by the elders, who see it as a small price to pay for a night out without the kids. There’s an expressway that passes through our town, with the exits and entrances in the neighboring town. There was a petition to build an exit for our town, but the youth supported it while the elders refused. They were concerned that having an expressway would ruin the town, and they convinced the city council to deny the request. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to decide on a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it's a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that are only used annually for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. These communities are lined with apartment complexes, situated side by side like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully taken apart and set down the road, piece by piece. The first apartment complex you come across has been on the news for some unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on that too much - appearances can be deceiving. But the complexes next to it and the ones beside that one are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to start their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days with high attendance. The road intersects with another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people with broken bones on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park with inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside it, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There's a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Where are we?” she asked as we drove by the endless cornfields stretching out in every direction. “This is it!” I replied, knowing she’d be surprised by the expansive open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a 5-minute walk from her door, and she’d never seen such vast emptiness. Stunned by the omnipresence of cornfields, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nDriving along the two-lane country road, you’ll reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it lies the small housing development where I live. The homes are mostly brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land taken pride in by their owners. During spring, vibrantly colored flowers and midwestern trees abound, changing with each season. Luxury Mercedes Benz cars gleam in the midday sun after a good wash. The driveways are filled with these high-end vehicles.\n\nContinuing toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly smile. He spends the whole day mowing his lawn, often singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he’s genuine and has a fascinating past. He was a doctor once, now blending into the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, you’ll reach my house. The side yard is filled with geese that our Terrier chases. Out back lies a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Crossing the wooden bridge is an untouched oasis with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts and hunting “animals” (really just chasing them). There’s always something to do and a neighborhood child to play with.\n\nWinters in our small town can be harsh, but there’s nothing more beautiful. The yard turns into an empty wilderness, with trees shedding their vibrant colors, and a rare snowfall transforming it into a winter wonderland. Snow angels and snowmen line the backyard. My sister and I used to fight, and during winter, we’d use snowballs as our weapons. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to store our arsenal. It was our little wonderland, where we played without a care in the world.",
            "The first thing you need to get is that Portland, Oregon is a place like no other. It's got a tagline, \"Keep Portland Weird\", plastered on the wall of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on half those operations. It's a throwback to the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a place that was unknown and cheap, breeding all sorts of unique subcultures. To some, it's a call to come and be weird, not in a bad way, but in a way that's accepted, even celebrated. Despite the influx of transplanted Californians and the constant condo construction, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't about accepting everything, but it is about accepting things that are unusual. We have modern conveniences and modern issues, like everyone else, sourcing most of our goods from China. Every neighborhood has its own flavor of weird, but it's not all quirkiness. We've got yoga and hipsters and business professionals too. Maybe weird means we take all that less seriously. In my neighborhood, colorful houses, flower and herb gardens, and free boxes are common. Free boxes are magical, containing clothes, books, or anything someone doesn't want anymore. That's the Portland magic. That's what Portland is about to me, but I'm just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people in my neighborhood would never pick clothes from a sidewalk box. They'd rather go to goat yoga or a Timbers match (Portland's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people chasing dreams or dreaming about chasing dreams, spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem, often tied to mental health issues, and the constant rain and cloudy weather might exacerbate that. There's also a significant homelessness problem, drawn by Portland's social services, but not enough to help everyone. The non-homeless are divided between care and disdain. In this, Portland is just like any other city.",
            "The mountains stand tall and unyielding, a constant presence in my life. From my northward view, they witness the sun's daily ascent and descent, unperturbed by the passage of time or the turmoil of life. Even when I am consumed by work and daily life, taking notice of them seems to elude me. Yet, on days of great stress and anxiety, they call out to me, offering solace and strength to carry on, one day at a time. It was during my undergraduate years that I first moved here, and the mountains to the north of campus were the first to steal my heart. While the university and town both have their own unique charms, it is the mountains that reign supreme in my affection.\n\nThe city is a blend of the old and the new. Just a short walk or bus ride away from the college campus lies a bustling downtown area, characterized by its vintage brick buildings. This urban vibe is interrupted by the quiet, picturesque neighborhoods nestled around the library, providing a stark contrast to the city's energy. This dynamic mix of atmospheres creates an inviting atmosphere, begging to be explored and cherished. The town holds a special place in my memory, with each locale tied to a particular joy or sorrow.\n\nOne of my fond memories includes late-night walks through the park, past the rusted swings, often with friends after an intense study session. On other occasions, I would dash through the busy downtown to catch a movie in the upscale theater, an indulgence provided by the university. However, this town is not without its hardships. The ponds, in particular, have seen their share of tears and introspection, especially during those late-night existential crises. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live out their lives has often led me to question my own purpose. It was during these moments that I found my way to the main street, where the sun would cast its golden rays upon the palm trees, painting the sky. As I gazed up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking towards my old friends, the mountains. They stood tall and steadfast, their peaks touching the hazy blue and yellow sky, and as if sharing a secret, they reminded me of my inner strength.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding the place won't be a problem! Public transport is abundant and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is a bustling urban neighborhood, so you'll still be in the heart of the city. Be prepared to spot plenty of Asian stores as you walk around. The neighborhood has seen a significant influx of Asian residents over the past two decades, leading to Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, every block. These businesses are beloved by locals for their excellent food, affordable prices, and convenience. Just near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, enhancing the accessibility of grocery shopping. Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian, though. It's quite diverse with immigrants and their children from first and second generations. Many large businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but there's also a recently renovated park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a child-friendly water fountain. NYC parks are diverse, and you'll see a mix of people getting along well. There aren’t many corporate buildings here; most are co-op or condo apartments, with two-family houses predominant. Most residents are friendly, but the neighborhood can be noisy, especially from cars blasting music or accelerating through the streets. At night, keep your guard up as the neighborhood is generally safe but can be unpredictable with people starting trouble, bullies, and thieves. I've been bullied in the past through physical assault, and package theft occurs too. Morning commutes can be unpleasant due to dog waste on sidewalks. Keep your shoes clean!",
            "The sidewalks are scarce around here, and my house sits atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood, earning it the nickname \"workout hill\" for the joggers who love to run uphill daily. The streets are pot-holed and somewhat treacherous, and a lot of telephone and electric wires look worn out from the frequent rainfall and storms. The constant repairs make them look like a patchwork quilt. Tall evergreen trees abound, but the locals don't much appreciate them; they block the ocean view and obstruct the view of the bay. As a result, many houses are built high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories. At sunset, the water glows and the sky turns orange, but it's often cloudy, and the view is usually obscured by a haze. Moss grows on everything it can, including cars and railings. I once left my car parked for a month and it was covered in moss when I returned. It took me three hours to scrape it off. There aren't many children around, but there's a school nearby, and the neighborhood is populated mostly by older folks and retirees. Instead of kids, the locals have dogs; they're often seen in people's lawns or racing down the street. Occasionally, a dog might sneak into someone's house if a door or window is left open. Rabbits are a common sight, and gardeners dislike them because they damage plants and dig up lawns. My cats have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. Birds are also abundant, ranging from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle, which gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. There aren't many stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, you'll find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't very wide, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the other shore through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, so we experience a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but overall, it's a quiet neighborhood. The folks around here are rather permanent, and I've grown familiar with most of them. They keep themselves busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we make use of the hill on our side street for sledding. Our house is situated at the front corner of our street, so we observe everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the cars that drive around. Whenever we see an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors engage in walking for exercise or to walk their dogs, while the kids enjoy riding their bikes. We spend a significant amount of time at home since we work from there. My wife and I have two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, so we're a familiar sight to the neighbors. We enjoy going outside to play, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we'll grill on our back deck, and the smell from the barbecue is always pleasant. Lawn mowers are a common sound from March to October as the grass grows, and we enjoy the smell of burning leaves in the Fall, which indicates the arrival of the season. Recently, we've had a long Fall as the winter has been minimal. Our garage is at the rear of the house, so we use the front door mainly when someone knocks, which doesn't happen often. I like to work on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, the neighborhood is quiet. Thanksgiving and other similar events bring in extra cars as families from out of town visit. Overall, I enjoy living here, and if it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where the only color you see is brown. Unless you've been here, you won't understand how it feels to see dirt everywhere, and when you do see a green lawn, you know that person's spending a mint on lawn care. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered all over the place, but now it's mostly the same, with a bunch of new additions. It's starting to look like a city, but I guess that's how most places are changing these days. The people are generally friendly, but it's like any city - you've got your good parts and bad. I live among a bunch of friendly old folks, so I'd say it's a nice neighborhood.\n\nThe stores here are mostly chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale shopping, you'll have to travel. I've never seen a Whole Foods or anything like that around here. The most common jobs are construction - it's because this city's still not fully developed, so there's plenty of open space to build on. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not looking to go back. Speaking of construction, that's where my full-time job is - I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love about my home is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for its stark beauty, and the unique ecosystems created by the climate and topography. We have a bunch of different animals here, and my kids are obsessed with them. Right now, they're outside trying to catch lizards and desert bugs.\n\nAs for attractions, Victorville's a great place for families to experience the desert. If you can, try to visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. It's the perfect mix of activities and fun. Plus, you can pop over to Wrightwood and enjoy the snow-covered mountains. If you're interested in natural history and culture, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's got geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When it comes to what I consider my neighborhood, I'm sure my answer is a bit unconventional. Unlike others who might talk about their own home and community, I look at my neighborhood as the college campus I reside on, with the people living in my dormitory as my community. While the surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent, it has several similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, it's important to clarify the types of housing I encounter. There are three primary types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories.\n\nIn the apartments, you'll typically find between 2 to 4 people per room, with about 4 to 6 rooms per floor. A building that houses about 2 floors can accommodate around 20 people. The next type is the actual houses available for rent to those affiliated with the school. These are usually 2 to 4-bedroom setups, often occupied by alumni. Though less common, they are scattered throughout the neighborhood. Lastly, the dormitory-style housing, which houses hundreds of students, is the most prevalent type. In these, two people share a room as the norm, with some exceptions.\n\nNow, let's talk about the people who make up this neighborhood. My school prides itself on diversity, and that's reflected in the residents of my neighborhood. You'll find people from various cultures and age groups. Professional staff tend to live in the houses, younger students in the dormitories, and older students in the apartment-style housing.\n\nMoving on to the stores and parks, my neighborhood has a variety of dining options, the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores, and even a playground for the diverse community. Anything you might need is within walking distance. The park is kept clean and safe by the community, much like any other neighborhood.",
            "Well, let me tell you, I've been hanging around here for about a decade now, so I guess I can spill the beans on what I've learned. First off, I was pretty bummed when I first rolled into Stockbridge. I came from Riverdale, and I'll be honest, I missed it something fierce. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a neighborhood that was supposedly \"not ghetto\" and had a better high school. It took some time to adjust, but I eventually made some new friends and even a few enemies at school. I never got to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his crew next door, and Dennis for a bit. They've been great, and I mean that. I even caught Ms. Veda's bouquet at Mr. Glen's wedding! I miss those times. I wish I could share more about the neighborhood, but it's like a maze, and now I've got a GPS so I can take my time exploring it. I've only made it as far as hanging out with Kason and Curtis, and we'd play video games and live life to the fullest. There's also a park where I go to relax and enjoy nature, which helps me unwind. Sometimes I'll bring my bokken sword and practice my balance. I've got a basketball and tennis court too, even though I haven't played in years. My dad and Mr. Graves used to drill us in tennis, and we always had a blast. There's a lot of good times I've had here, and I'm looking forward to many more.",
            "My living situation in the neighborhood is quite convenient since it's close to the college I attend. I live in an apartment building that's surrounded by a few restaurants and bars. One of the bars recently got a new name, and it's a bit pricier than the others, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The people here are mostly either college students or lower-income individuals, which makes the atmosphere relaxed. There's an elementary school nearby, and while I don't know my neighbors, I don't mind since they tend to smoke a lot of weed. The management has put an air freshener unit outside their apartment, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, though it might be seen as rude. The buildings around me are mostly old, but some have been renovated. Down the street, there are newer apartment buildings, but they seem cheaply constructed and overpriced, likely due to their proximity to campus. There's a budget-friendly restaurant about five minutes away, serving food on paper plates, and most of it is microwaved. Across from it is a gas station known for its poor working conditions. However, the road was recently redone with city funds, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, and while some were cut down, there are still quite a few. Behind my apartment complex is another row of trees, followed by more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street right behind it, which is not as pleasant due to its dilapidated sidewalks and shabby buildings. There are a lot of trees on 43rd Street, likely to hide the buildings' condition. Crime is present in the area, particularly at the apartment complex on that street, but I can't point the finger at just them. There are also apartments across from me with similar issues. Despite this, I like my living situation as it's affordable and offers easy access to amenities, including the university and two bus stops for easy travel.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced out here and there to give the impression of individual homes. Most of the time, they're painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Nearly everyone in the neighborhood is friends with each other. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of the not-so-planned driveway, chatting while the neighborhood kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing change from our modern, tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. Surrounding us are fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and white clouds. The big downside? We've been under tornado warnings this season, and last night, we even heard the sirens. So, I found myself in my bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, going from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sun emerged and it started to rain, followed by a double rainbow. I grabbed my camera to share the sight with friends and family, who were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before folks started coming home. Then it was back to normal, with mothers and children outside as dinner cooked. It's a great neighborhood for this gal from New Hampshire who recently moved to North Carolina. I love the southern accents here. My place is a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else's. On the outside, all the houses look the same, but the apartments inside vary in size. Some are quite small, which doesn't make sense to me. I enjoy walking through the big field behind my place and strolling down to the pond, not meant for swimming. I've spotted deer and heard the giant bullfrog's morning song. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by rooster crows from nearby farms, making it feel like a small village community. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that lets us know he's there with his evening bray. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was tough at first, but I ended up bonding with a guy living two houses down and another one on my street. They aren't here anymore, but the memories stay. The people who were here when I first moved are still around. My neighborhood is pretty standard for an American suburb; it's got lots of two-story houses. Weekends or whenever it's warm outside, you hear kids playing. Most days are quiet, and I've never had any problems with neighbors. They leave you alone unless you need help. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one snatched off my porch. I trust my neighbors. There's a park a couple minutes away where I've played basketball, football, and baseball with my neighbors. I have some bad memories there too, like getting elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good ones outweigh the bad. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're younger and love playing on swings and slides. Visiting the park makes me nostalgic. The neighborhood is diverse. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a one-mile radius. People these days mostly use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food places are common, and there are plenty of pizza joints. Stores have everything you need. There are several dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're into homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm happy with my neighborhood. Seeing horror stories about other people's neighborhoods on social media makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town in South Carolina. It doesn't jump out from the crowd, but it's got a significant impact in the agriculture sector. Johnston, as it's known, proudly boasts its status as the Peach Capital of the World on the welcoming sign. The town is mostly made up of farmland where peach trees and cattle are the dominant sights. Houses are scattered and typically have metal roofs to withstand the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. Most of these houses are a distance from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the main town area, there's a single four-way stop with a stoplight. This is where you'll find the only stores in town. There are a few places to get \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; Gary's, a small burger chain; and a now-closed pizzeria. There's also Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy best known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, a small grocery store, is called IGA. While it's the only grocery store in town, many people prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General, which offers a wide range of everyday items and is always busy. There's also a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. Attached is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomers offering services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are located away from the main town area; they are small but well-equipped. The town only has a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School, and students must attend middle and high school in the next town over. There are no parks, but they're working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide more opportunities for families and attract visitors. There's not much to do in town; no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or many restaurants. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small that you could pass through without realizing it!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who've gone missing. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I couldn't believe it—neither had any of my friends. It's a struggle, that's for sure. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep thinking about it. It's expensive, but we've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market finds and well-loved clothes. It's like the smell of adulthood, one that sticks even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can shop at two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it inside the thrift stores. No matter how busy it is outside, the stores are always quiet. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there seem to be more and more people and cars flooding the city. It's a developing place, they say. With one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery headquartered here, it's showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals and nobody asks too much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where showing too much concern means you care. Here, people don't pry into each other's lives. You can maintain your privacy as long as you like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. With the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty well. I try to be considerate and leave them food, and they do the same. I bring mail for them, and they do for me. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't totally ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home is what you might expect from a typical cookie cutter suburb. A homeowner's association rules the roost here, and it shows in the pristine condition of everything. Front yards are uniform with a small patch of grass, a bit of decorative pebbles, and a short driveway. Some houses even have small trees. Everyone's got a two-car garage, and the streets are all freshly paved with no potholes in sight. The houses are mostly single story, though every now and then you'll see a two-story one. We don't have individual mailboxes like you'd find at some places. Instead, there's a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street, with two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's obsession with uniformity is evident here. My neighborhood is right at the edge of a nearby city, which makes it a mix of rural and suburban living. We've got plenty of land for everything. Multiple community pools are well-maintained and gated, and there are walking trails for dog walks or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park to get your exercise. The neighborhood is big enough to run around for some good exercise. Most people here are retired, but there are some middle-aged and young professionals mixed in too. The city itself is large by population but has a small-town feel. All the amenities you'd expect are here, like a mall that's not huge but gets the job done. It's just a 15-minute drive to get to more significant places, and once there, you've got high-end grocery stores and bargain outlets. All in all, it's a safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical neighborhood. We've got nice things like pools and walking trails, and while we're not next door to any major shopping, a short drive gets you to any major chain you need.",
            "I live in a cozy Midwestern town nestled just outside a bustling metropolis. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is the town's most economically challenged area. Still, it's not unpleasant, and my neighbors are generally warm and welcoming. While crime rates are slightly higher, overall, it's quite low. We've had a few incidents, including a shooting and a homicide nearby, but my family hasn't been directly affected, aside from some minor thefts from our porch. The opioid epidemic has taken a toll on the town, but there are plenty of resources to combat it, like addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions. Despite these challenges, our town has plenty of positives. My son's elementary school is fantastic, with a supportive staff and a positive atmosphere. The PTO organizes great events, and they provide free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The City Council has made improvements, like repaving roads and refurbishing parks, but these mainly target the central and western parts of town, leaving the east side feeling neglected. Still, I enjoy living here. The people are friendly, the schools are top-notch, and our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture and history. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with a story to tell. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill is a cool little arcade bar that attracts all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you'll often see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's quite spacious for the part of town it's in. Concrete encircles the park, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains heavily, making it tough to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together and in the city center, they can keep warm and are also near the family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city isn't the old buildings or the architecture that dots the rolling hills towards the ocean. It's the people who make my neighborhood their home. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence, with federal officials and the DEA sweeping through to clean the streets. The stories live on, even three decades later. The people here work hard to keep their neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their city and on their block. They warn that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop at night. That warning echoes the past, tinged with social conditioning. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to pass for not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, who feels the constant reminders of our nation's problems. It's a place where I feel alive walking the streets at night, meeting people who offer a jacket more often than to rob me. It's where laundromat owners stay open late so I can charge my phone on rainy nights. It's a place where I can sit, feeling invisible, on grey and dreary nights at the mercy of the concrete store fronts, only to have someone stop and hand me $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I reside in Rural America, nestled in a small Michigan town. Here, you transition from farmland to quaint tourist spots, with no big city malls, Wal-marts, or Applebee's in sight. Everything is a drive away. Yet, I'm blessed to call one of the most scenic places in the world home, surrounded by magnificent bodies of water - Lake Michigan to the east and Lake Charlevoix to the west. Everywhere you go, there's a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood embodies small-town living. Houses are unique, not cookie-cutter; many have basements visible from the road, and a mix of older aluminum siding and vibrant colors. Most homes have yards with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. It's a Middle America feel, reflecting hardworking folks building a life here. Kids zoom up and down the streets, neighbors wave, and dogs are walked or biked nearby. Lawns are well-kept, with no leaf piles and neatly trimmed plants. It's not a showy neighborhood, but a peaceful, safe haven perfect for raising a family. Nearby, you'll find the county sheriff's department, health department, recycling center, and baseball/softball fields. Our small-town airport is close by, and you'll hear small planes taking off and landing. A short walk leads to an ice cream parlor, and if you're up for it, downtown is just a bike ride away. It's a truly wonderful place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",

The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city is a melting pot of diversity. Neighborhoods are scattered between commercial areas, where all sorts of businesses thrive. Offices, stores, and restaurants galore, some big-name brands, some small boutiques. They're everywhere, even in quiet neighborhoods, making them no longer so serene. Parks abound, and people love bringing their children there. The folks here are diverse too. In one area, there's a strong LGBTQ+, Orthodox Jewish, and Soviet refugee community. Step outside, and you'll find more races and origins. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, they're just miles away, but those miles can be long and congested. Traffic's a nightmare, and parking? Forget about it. Yet, new apartment buildings are popping up everywhere. It's a hot spot, but residents are grumpy about more people and cars. Houses come in all shapes and sizes, from single-family homes to condos. There's even a mix of ages in the neighborhood, but I barely know my neighbors. It's not a tight-knit community anymore, but I have fond memories of playing with my childhood friends.",
            "My neighborhood is quite unique. Most houses are single-family homes, but you'll find a few that have been divided into two, while still being attached to each other, if you catch my drift. My house boasts a small yard in front and a driveway to the left. It, like many others, is a reminder of a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream. While that dream seems to be waning, our neighborhood and many others like it still stand, still clinging to it as best we can. The people here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the yards aren't as well-maintained, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the kids play as if the world revolves around them. The local school, standing tall for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always filled with kids. The homes may look different, but they all feel the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and the kids play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many residents have lived here for generations, and they've got stories to tell about a time when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school once, but when Hollywood stopped making karate movies, the kids lost interest, so it became a pharmacy. “Drugs make everything better,” I’ve heard. There's also an old movie theater that shows classic films at a discount, shunned by the youth but loved by the elders, who see it as a small price to pay for a night out without the kids. There’s an expressway that passes through our town, with the exits and entrances in the neighboring town. There was a petition to build an exit for our town, but the youth supported it while the elders refused. They were concerned that having an expressway would ruin the town, and they convinced the city council to deny the request. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to decide on a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it's a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that are only used annually for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. These communities are lined with apartment complexes, situated side by side like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully taken apart and set down the road, piece by piece. The first apartment complex you come across has been on the news for some unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on that too much - appearances can be deceiving. But the complexes next to it and the ones beside that one are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to start their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days with high attendance. The road intersects with another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people with broken bones on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park with inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside it, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There's a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Where are we?” she asked as we drove by the endless cornfields stretching out in every direction. “This is it!” I replied, knowing she’d be surprised by the expansive open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a 5-minute walk from her door, and she’d never seen such vast emptiness. Stunned by the omnipresence of cornfields, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nDriving along the two-lane country road, you’ll reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it lies the small housing development where I live. The homes are mostly brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land taken pride in by their owners. During spring, vibrantly colored flowers and midwestern trees abound, changing with each season. Luxury Mercedes Benz cars gleam in the midday sun after a good wash. The driveways are filled with these high-end vehicles.\n\nContinuing toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly smile. He spends the whole day mowing his lawn, often singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he’s genuine and has a fascinating past. He was a doctor once, now blending into the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, you’ll reach my house. The side yard is filled with geese that our Terrier chases. Out back lies a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Crossing the wooden bridge is an untouched oasis with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts and hunting “animals” (really just chasing them). There’s always something to do and a neighborhood child to play with.\n\nWinters in our small town can be harsh, but there’s nothing more beautiful. The yard turns into an empty wilderness, with trees shedding their vibrant colors, and a rare snowfall transforming it into a winter wonderland. Snow angels and snowmen line the backyard. My sister and I used to fight, and during winter, we’d use snowballs as our weapons. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to store our arsenal. It was our little wonderland, where we played without a care in the world.",
            "The first thing you need to get is that Portland, Oregon is a place like no other. It's got a tagline, \"Keep Portland Weird\", plastered on the wall of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on half those operations. It's a throwback to the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a place that was unknown and cheap, breeding all sorts of unique subcultures. To some, it's a call to come and be weird, not in a bad way, but in a way that's accepted, even celebrated. Despite the influx of transplanted Californians and the constant condo construction, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't about accepting everything, but it is about accepting things that are unusual. We have modern conveniences and modern issues, like everyone else, sourcing most of our goods from China. Every neighborhood has its own flavor of weird, but it's not all quirkiness. We've got yoga and hipsters and business professionals too. Maybe weird means we take all that less seriously. In my neighborhood, colorful houses, flower and herb gardens, and free boxes are common. Free boxes are magical, containing clothes, books, or anything someone doesn't want anymore. That's the Portland magic. That's what Portland is about to me, but I'm just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people in my neighborhood would never pick clothes from a sidewalk box. They'd rather go to goat yoga or a Timbers match (Portland's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people chasing dreams or dreaming about chasing dreams, spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem, often tied to mental health issues, and the constant rain and cloudy weather might exacerbate that. There's also a significant homelessness problem, drawn by Portland's social services, but not enough to help everyone. The non-homeless are divided between care and disdain. In this, Portland is just like any other city.",
            "The mountains stand tall and unyielding, a constant presence in my life. From my northward view, they witness the sun's daily ascent and descent, unperturbed by the passage of time or the turmoil of life. Even when I am consumed by work and daily life, taking notice of them seems to elude me. Yet, on days of great stress and anxiety, they call out to me, offering solace and strength to carry on, one day at a time. It was during my undergraduate years that I first moved here, and the mountains to the north of campus were the first to steal my heart. While the university and town both have their own unique charms, it is the mountains that reign supreme in my affection.\n\nThe city is a blend of the old and the new. Just a short walk or bus ride away from the college campus lies a bustling downtown area, characterized by its vintage brick buildings. This urban vibe is interrupted by the quiet, picturesque neighborhoods nestled around the library, providing a stark contrast to the city's energy. This dynamic mix of atmospheres creates an inviting atmosphere, begging to be explored and cherished. The town holds a special place in my memory, with each locale tied to a particular joy or sorrow.\n\nOne of my fond memories includes late-night walks through the park, past the rusted swings, often with friends after an intense study session. On other occasions, I would dash through the busy downtown to catch a movie in the upscale theater, an indulgence provided by the university. However, this town is not without its hardships. The ponds, in particular, have seen their share of tears and introspection, especially during those late-night existential crises. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live out their lives has often led me to question my own purpose. It was during these moments that I found my way to the main street, where the sun would cast its golden rays upon the palm trees, painting the sky. As I gazed up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking towards my old friends, the mountains. They stood tall and steadfast, their peaks touching the hazy blue and yellow sky, and as if sharing a secret, they reminded me of my inner strength.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding the place won't be a problem! Public transport is abundant and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is a bustling urban neighborhood, so you'll still be in the heart of the city. Be prepared to spot plenty of Asian stores as you walk around. The neighborhood has seen a significant influx of Asian residents over the past two decades, leading to Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, every block. These businesses are beloved by locals for their excellent food, affordable prices, and convenience. Just near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, enhancing the accessibility of grocery shopping. Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian, though. It's quite diverse with immigrants and their children from first and second generations. Many large businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but there's also a recently renovated park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a child-friendly water fountain. NYC parks are diverse, and you'll see a mix of people getting along well. There aren’t many corporate buildings here; most are co-op or condo apartments, with two-family houses predominant. Most residents are friendly, but the neighborhood can be noisy, especially from cars blasting music or accelerating through the streets. At night, keep your guard up as the neighborhood is generally safe but can be unpredictable with people starting trouble, bullies, and thieves. I've been bullied in the past through physical assault, and package theft occurs too. Morning commutes can be unpleasant due to dog waste on sidewalks. Keep your shoes clean!",
            "The sidewalks are scarce around here, and my house sits atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood, earning it the nickname \"workout hill\" for the joggers who love to run uphill daily. The streets are pot-holed and somewhat treacherous, and a lot of telephone and electric wires look worn out from the frequent rainfall and storms. The constant repairs make them look like a patchwork quilt. Tall evergreen trees abound, but the locals don't much appreciate them; they block the ocean view and obstruct the view of the bay. As a result, many houses are built high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories. At sunset, the water glows and the sky turns orange, but it's often cloudy, and the view is usually obscured by a haze. Moss grows on everything it can, including cars and railings. I once left my car parked for a month and it was covered in moss when I returned. It took me three hours to scrape it off. There aren't many children around, but there's a school nearby, and the neighborhood is populated mostly by older folks and retirees. Instead of kids, the locals have dogs; they're often seen in people's lawns or racing down the street. Occasionally, a dog might sneak into someone's house if a door or window is left open. Rabbits are a common sight, and gardeners dislike them because they damage plants and dig up lawns. My cats have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. Birds are also abundant, ranging from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle, which gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. There aren't many stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, you'll find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't very wide, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the other shore through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, so we experience a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but overall, it's a quiet neighborhood. The folks around here are rather permanent, and I've grown familiar with most of them. They keep themselves busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we make use of the hill on our side street for sledding. Our house is situated at the front corner of our street, so we observe everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the cars that drive around. Whenever we see an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors engage in walking for exercise or to walk their dogs, while the kids enjoy riding their bikes. We spend a significant amount of time at home since we work from there. My wife and I have two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, so we're a familiar sight to the neighbors. We enjoy going outside to play, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we'll grill on our back deck, and the smell from the barbecue is always pleasant. Lawn mowers are a common sound from March to October as the grass grows, and we enjoy the smell of burning leaves in the Fall, which indicates the arrival of the season. Recently, we've had a long Fall as the winter has been minimal. Our garage is at the rear of the house, so we use the front door mainly when someone knocks, which doesn't happen often. I like to work on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, the neighborhood is quiet. Thanksgiving and other similar events bring in extra cars as families from out of town visit. Overall, I enjoy living here, and if it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where the only color you see is brown. Unless you've been here, you won't understand how it feels to see dirt everywhere, and when you do see a green lawn, you know that person's spending a mint on lawn care. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered all over the place, but now it's mostly the same, with a bunch of new additions. It's starting to look like a city, but I guess that's how most places are changing these days. The people are generally friendly, but it's like any city - you've got your good parts and bad. I live among a bunch of friendly old folks, so I'd say it's a nice neighborhood.\n\nThe stores here are mostly chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale shopping, you'll have to travel. I've never seen a Whole Foods or anything like that around here. The most common jobs are construction - it's because this city's still not fully developed, so there's plenty of open space to build on. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not looking to go back. Speaking of construction, that's where my full-time job is - I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love about my home is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for its stark beauty, and the unique ecosystems created by the climate and topography. We have a bunch of different animals here, and my kids are obsessed with them. Right now, they're outside trying to catch lizards and desert bugs.\n\nAs for attractions, Victorville's a great place for families to experience the desert. If you can, try to visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. It's the perfect mix of activities and fun. Plus, you can pop over to Wrightwood and enjoy the snow-covered mountains. If you're interested in natural history and culture, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's got geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When it comes to what I consider my neighborhood, I'm sure my answer is a bit unconventional. Unlike others who might talk about their own home and community, I look at my neighborhood as the college campus I reside on, with the people living in my dormitory as my community. While the surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent, it has several similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, it's important to clarify the types of housing I encounter. There are three primary types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories.\n\nIn the apartments, you'll typically find between 2 to 4 people per room, with about 4 to 6 rooms per floor. A building that houses about 2 floors can accommodate around 20 people. The next type is the actual houses available for rent to those affiliated with the school. These are usually 2 to 4-bedroom setups, often occupied by alumni. Though less common, they are scattered throughout the neighborhood. Lastly, the dormitory-style housing, which houses hundreds of students, is the most prevalent type. In these, two people share a room as the norm, with some exceptions.\n\nNow, let's talk about the people who make up this neighborhood. My school prides itself on diversity, and that's reflected in the residents of my neighborhood. You'll find people from various cultures and age groups. Professional staff tend to live in the houses, younger students in the dormitories, and older students in the apartment-style housing.\n\nMoving on to the stores and parks, my neighborhood has a variety of dining options, the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores, and even a playground for the diverse community. Anything you might need is within walking distance. The park is kept clean and safe by the community, much like any other neighborhood.",
            "Well, let me tell you, I've been hanging around here for about a decade now, so I guess I can spill the beans on what I've learned. First off, I was pretty bummed when I first rolled into Stockbridge. I came from Riverdale, and I'll be honest, I missed it something fierce. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a neighborhood that was supposedly \"not ghetto\" and had a better high school. It took some time to adjust, but I eventually made some new friends and even a few enemies at school. I never got to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his crew next door, and Dennis for a bit. They've been great, and I mean that. I even caught Ms. Veda's bouquet at Mr. Glen's wedding! I miss those times. I wish I could share more about the neighborhood, but it's like a maze, and now I've got a GPS so I can take my time exploring it. I've only made it as far as hanging out with Kason and Curtis, and we'd play video games and live life to the fullest. There's also a park where I go to relax and enjoy nature, which helps me unwind. Sometimes I'll bring my bokken sword and practice my balance. I've got a basketball and tennis court too, even though I haven't played in years. My dad and Mr. Graves used to drill us in tennis, and we always had a blast. There's a lot of good times I've had here, and I'm looking forward to many more.",
            "My living situation in the neighborhood is quite convenient since it's close to the college I attend. I live in an apartment building that's surrounded by a few restaurants and bars. One of the bars recently got a new name, and it's a bit pricier than the others, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The people here are mostly either college students or lower-income individuals, which makes the atmosphere relaxed. There's an elementary school nearby, and while I don't know my neighbors, I don't mind since they tend to smoke a lot of weed. The management has put an air freshener unit outside their apartment, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, though it might be seen as rude. The buildings around me are mostly old, but some have been renovated. Down the street, there are newer apartment buildings, but they seem cheaply constructed and overpriced, likely due to their proximity to campus. There's a budget-friendly restaurant about five minutes away, serving food on paper plates, and most of it is microwaved. Across from it is a gas station known for its poor working conditions. However, the road was recently redone with city funds, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, and while some were cut down, there are still quite a few. Behind my apartment complex is another row of trees, followed by more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street right behind it, which is not as pleasant due to its dilapidated sidewalks and shabby buildings. There are a lot of trees on 43rd Street, likely to hide the buildings' condition. Crime is present in the area, particularly at the apartment complex on that street, but I can't point the finger at just them. There are also apartments across from me with similar issues. Despite this, I like my living situation as it's affordable and offers easy access to amenities, including the university and two bus stops for easy travel.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced out here and there to give the impression of individual homes. Most of the time, they're painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Nearly everyone in the neighborhood is friends with each other. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of the not-so-planned driveway, chatting while the neighborhood kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing change from our modern, tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. Surrounding us are fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and white clouds. The big downside? We've been under tornado warnings this season, and last night, we even heard the sirens. So, I found myself in my bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, going from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sun emerged and it started to rain, followed by a double rainbow. I grabbed my camera to share the sight with friends and family, who were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before folks started coming home. Then it was back to normal, with mothers and children outside as dinner cooked. It's a great neighborhood for this gal from New Hampshire who recently moved to North Carolina. I love the southern accents here. My place is a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else's. On the outside, all the houses look the same, but the apartments inside vary in size. Some are quite small, which doesn't make sense to me. I enjoy walking through the big field behind my place and strolling down to the pond, not meant for swimming. I've spotted deer and heard the giant bullfrog's morning song. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by rooster crows from nearby farms, making it feel like a small village community. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that lets us know he's there with his evening bray. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was tough at first, but I ended up bonding with a guy living two houses down and another one on my street. They aren't here anymore, but the memories stay. The people who were here when I first moved are still around. My neighborhood is pretty standard for an American suburb; it's got lots of two-story houses. Weekends or whenever it's warm outside, you hear kids playing. Most days are quiet, and I've never had any problems with neighbors. They leave you alone unless you need help. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one snatched off my porch. I trust my neighbors. There's a park a couple minutes away where I've played basketball, football, and baseball with my neighbors. I have some bad memories there too, like getting elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good ones outweigh the bad. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're younger and love playing on swings and slides. Visiting the park makes me nostalgic. The neighborhood is diverse. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a one-mile radius. People these days mostly use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food places are common, and there are plenty of pizza joints. Stores have everything you need. There are several dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're into homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm happy with my neighborhood. Seeing horror stories about other people's neighborhoods on social media makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town in South Carolina. It doesn't jump out from the crowd, but it's got a significant impact in the agriculture sector. Johnston, as it's known, proudly boasts its status as the Peach Capital of the World on the welcoming sign. The town is mostly made up of farmland where peach trees and cattle are the dominant sights. Houses are scattered and typically have metal roofs to withstand the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. Most of these houses are a distance from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the main town area, there's a single four-way stop with a stoplight. This is where you'll find the only stores in town. There are a few places to get \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; Gary's, a small burger chain; and a now-closed pizzeria. There's also Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy best known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, a small grocery store, is called IGA. While it's the only grocery store in town, many people prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General, which offers a wide range of everyday items and is always busy. There's also a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. Attached is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomers offering services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are located away from the main town area; they are small but well-equipped. The town only has a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School, and students must attend middle and high school in the next town over. There are no parks, but they're working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide more opportunities for families and attract visitors. There's not much to do in town; no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or many restaurants. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small that you could pass through without realizing it!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who've gone missing. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I couldn't believe it—neither had any of my friends. It's a struggle, that's for sure. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep thinking about it. It's expensive, but we've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market finds and well-loved clothes. It's like the smell of adulthood, one that sticks even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can shop at two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it inside the thrift stores. No matter how busy it is outside, the stores are always quiet. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there seem to be more and more people and cars flooding the city. It's a developing place, they say. With one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery headquartered here, it's showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals and nobody asks too much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where showing too much concern means you care. Here, people don't pry into each other's lives. You can maintain your privacy as long as you like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. With the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty well. I try to be considerate and leave them food, and they do the same. I bring mail for them, and they do for me. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't totally ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home is what you might expect from a typical cookie cutter suburb. A homeowner's association rules the roost here, and it shows in the pristine condition of everything. Front yards are uniform with a small patch of grass, a bit of decorative pebbles, and a short driveway. Some houses even have small trees. Everyone's got a two-car garage, and the streets are all freshly paved with no potholes in sight. The houses are mostly single story, though every now and then you'll see a two-story one. We don't have individual mailboxes like you'd find at some places. Instead, there's a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street, with two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's obsession with uniformity is evident here. My neighborhood is right at the edge of a nearby city, which makes it a mix of rural and suburban living. We've got plenty of land for everything. Multiple community pools are well-maintained and gated, and there are walking trails for dog walks or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park to get your exercise. The neighborhood is big enough to run around for some good exercise. Most people here are retired, but there are some middle-aged and young professionals mixed in too. The city itself is large by population but has a small-town feel. All the amenities you'd expect are here, like a mall that's not huge but gets the job done. It's just a 15-minute drive to get to more significant places, and once there, you've got high-end grocery stores and bargain outlets. All in all, it's a safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical neighborhood. We've got nice things like pools and walking trails, and while we're not next door to any major shopping, a short drive gets you to any major chain you need.",
            "I live in a cozy Midwestern town nestled just outside a bustling metropolis. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is the town's most economically challenged area. Still, it's not unpleasant, and my neighbors are generally warm and welcoming. While crime rates are slightly higher, overall, it's quite low. We've had a few incidents, including a shooting and a homicide nearby, but my family hasn't been directly affected, aside from some minor thefts from our porch. The opioid epidemic has taken a toll on the town, but there are plenty of resources to combat it, like addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions. Despite these challenges, our town has plenty of positives. My son's elementary school is fantastic, with a supportive staff and a positive atmosphere. The PTO organizes great events, and they provide free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The City Council has made improvements, like repaving roads and refurbishing parks, but these mainly target the central and western parts of town, leaving the east side feeling neglected. Still, I enjoy living here. The people are friendly, the schools are top-notch, and our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture and history. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with a story to tell. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill is a cool little arcade bar that attracts all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you'll often see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's quite spacious for the part of town it's in. Concrete encircles the park, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains heavily, making it tough to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together and in the city center, they can keep warm and are also near the family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city isn't the old buildings or the architecture that dots the rolling hills towards the ocean. It's the people who make my neighborhood their home. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence, with federal officials and the DEA sweeping through to clean the streets. The stories live on, even three decades later. The people here work hard to keep their neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their city and on their block. They warn that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop at night. That warning echoes the past, tinged with social conditioning. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to pass for not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, who feels the constant reminders of our nation's problems. It's a place where I feel alive walking the streets at night, meeting people who offer a jacket more often than to rob me. It's where laundromat owners stay open late so I can charge my phone on rainy nights. It's a place where I can sit, feeling invisible, on grey and dreary nights at the mercy of the concrete store fronts, only to have someone stop and hand me $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I reside in Rural America, nestled in a small Michigan town. Here, you transition from farmland to quaint tourist spots, with no big city malls, Wal-marts, or Applebee's in sight. Everything is a drive away. Yet, I'm blessed to call one of the most scenic places in the world home, surrounded by magnificent bodies of water - Lake Michigan to the east and Lake Charlevoix to the west. Everywhere you go, there's a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood embodies small-town living. Houses are unique, not cookie-cutter; many have basements visible from the road, and a mix of older aluminum siding and vibrant colors. Most homes have yards with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. It's a Middle America feel, reflecting hardworking folks building a life here. Kids zoom up and down the streets, neighbors wave, and dogs are walked or biked nearby. Lawns are well-kept, with no leaf piles and neatly trimmed plants. It's not a showy neighborhood, but a peaceful, safe haven perfect for raising a family. Nearby, you'll find the county sheriff's department, health department, recycling center, and baseball/softball fields. Our small-town airport is close by, and you'll hear small planes taking off and landing. A short walk leads to an ice cream parlor, and if you're up for it, downtown is just a bike ride away. It's a truly wonderful place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city is a melting pot of diversity. Neighborhoods are scattered between commercial areas, where all sorts of businesses thrive. Offices, stores, and restaurants galore, some big-name brands, some small boutiques. They're everywhere, even in quiet neighborhoods, making them no longer so serene. Parks abound, and people love bringing their children there. The folks here are diverse too. In one area, there's a strong LGBTQ+, Orthodox Jewish, and Soviet refugee community. Step outside, and you'll find more races and origins. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, they're just miles away, but those miles can be long and congested. Traffic's a nightmare, and parking? Forget about it. Yet, new apartment buildings are popping up everywhere. It's a hot spot, but residents are grumpy about more people and cars. Houses come in all shapes and sizes, from single-family homes to condos. There's even a mix of ages in the neighborhood, but I barely know my neighbors. It's not a tight-knit community anymore, but I have fond memories of playing with my childhood friends.",
            "My neighborhood is quite unique. Most houses are single-family homes, but you'll find a few that have been divided into two, while still being attached to each other, if you catch my drift. My house boasts a small yard in front and a driveway to the left. It, like many others, is a reminder of a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream. While that dream seems to be waning, our neighborhood and many others like it still stand, still clinging to it as best we can. The people here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the yards aren't as well-maintained, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the kids play as if the world revolves around them. The local school, standing tall for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always filled with kids. The homes may look different, but they all feel the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and the kids play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many residents have lived here for generations, and they've got stories to tell about a time when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school once, but when Hollywood stopped making karate movies, the kids lost interest, so it became a pharmacy. “Drugs make everything better,” I’ve heard. There's also an old movie theater that shows classic films at a discount, shunned by the youth but loved by the elders, who see it as a small price to pay for a night out without the kids. There’s an expressway that passes through our town, with the exits and entrances in the neighboring town. There was a petition to build an exit for our town, but the youth supported it while the elders refused. They were concerned that having an expressway would ruin the town, and they convinced the city council to deny the request. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to decide on a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it's a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that are only used annually for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. These communities are lined with apartment complexes, situated side by side like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully taken apart and set down the road, piece by piece. The first apartment complex you come across has been on the news for some unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on that too much - appearances can be deceiving. But the complexes next to it and the ones beside that one are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to start their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days with high attendance. The road intersects with another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people with broken bones on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park with inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside it, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There's a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Where are we?” she asked as we drove by the endless cornfields stretching out in every direction. “This is it!” I replied, knowing she’d be surprised by the expansive open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a 5-minute walk from her door, and she’d never seen such vast emptiness. Stunned by the omnipresence of cornfields, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nDriving along the two-lane country road, you’ll reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it lies the small housing development where I live. The homes are mostly brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land taken pride in by their owners. During spring, vibrantly colored flowers and midwestern trees abound, changing with each season. Luxury Mercedes Benz cars gleam in the midday sun after a good wash. The driveways are filled with these high-end vehicles.\n\nContinuing toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly smile. He spends the whole day mowing his lawn, often singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he’s genuine and has a fascinating past. He was a doctor once, now blending into the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, you’ll reach my house. The side yard is filled with geese that our Terrier chases. Out back lies a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Crossing the wooden bridge is an untouched oasis with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts and hunting “animals” (really just chasing them). There’s always something to do and a neighborhood child to play with.\n\nWinters in our small town can be harsh, but there’s nothing more beautiful. The yard turns into an empty wilderness, with trees shedding their vibrant colors, and a rare snowfall transforming it into a winter wonderland. Snow angels and snowmen line the backyard. My sister and I used to fight, and during winter, we’d use snowballs as our weapons. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to store our arsenal. It was our little wonderland, where we played without a care in the world.",
            "The first thing you need to get is that Portland, Oregon is a place like no other. It's got a tagline, \"Keep Portland Weird\", plastered on the wall of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on half those operations. It's a throwback to the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a place that was unknown and cheap, breeding all sorts of unique subcultures. To some, it's a call to come and be weird, not in a bad way, but in a way that's accepted, even celebrated. Despite the influx of transplanted Californians and the constant condo construction, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't about accepting everything, but it is about accepting things that are unusual. We have modern conveniences and modern issues, like everyone else, sourcing most of our goods from China. Every neighborhood has its own flavor of weird, but it's not all quirkiness. We've got yoga and hipsters and business professionals too. Maybe weird means we take all that less seriously. In my neighborhood, colorful houses, flower and herb gardens, and free boxes are common. Free boxes are magical, containing clothes, books, or anything someone doesn't want anymore. That's the Portland magic. That's what Portland is about to me, but I'm just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people in my neighborhood would never pick clothes from a sidewalk box. They'd rather go to goat yoga or a Timbers match (Portland's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people chasing dreams or dreaming about chasing dreams, spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem, often tied to mental health issues, and the constant rain and cloudy weather might exacerbate that. There's also a significant homelessness problem, drawn by Portland's social services, but not enough to help everyone. The non-homeless are divided between care and disdain. In this, Portland is just like any other city.",
            "The mountains stand tall and unyielding, a constant presence in my life. From my northward view, they witness the sun's daily ascent and descent, unperturbed by the passage of time or the turmoil of life. Even when I am consumed by work and daily life, taking notice of them seems to elude me. Yet, on days of great stress and anxiety, they call out to me, offering solace and strength to carry on, one day at a time. It was during my undergraduate years that I first moved here, and the mountains to the north of campus were the first to steal my heart. While the university and town both have their own unique charms, it is the mountains that reign supreme in my affection.\n\nThe city is a blend of the old and the new. Just a short walk or bus ride away from the college campus lies a bustling downtown area, characterized by its vintage brick buildings. This urban vibe is interrupted by the quiet, picturesque neighborhoods nestled around the library, providing a stark contrast to the city's energy. This dynamic mix of atmospheres creates an inviting atmosphere, begging to be explored and cherished. The town holds a special place in my memory, with each locale tied to a particular joy or sorrow.\n\nOne of my fond memories includes late-night walks through the park, past the rusted swings, often with friends after an intense study session. On other occasions, I would dash through the busy downtown to catch a movie in the upscale theater, an indulgence provided by the university. However, this town is not without its hardships. The ponds, in particular, have seen their share of tears and introspection, especially during those late-night existential crises. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live out their lives has often led me to question my own purpose. It was during these moments that I found my way to the main street, where the sun would cast its golden rays upon the palm trees, painting the sky. As I gazed up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking towards my old friends, the mountains. They stood tall and steadfast, their peaks touching the hazy blue and yellow sky, and as if sharing a secret, they reminded me of my inner strength.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding the place won't be a problem! Public transport is abundant and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is a bustling urban neighborhood, so you'll still be in the heart of the city. Be prepared to spot plenty of Asian stores as you walk around. The neighborhood has seen a significant influx of Asian residents over the past two decades, leading to Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, every block. These businesses are beloved by locals for their excellent food, affordable prices, and convenience. Just near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, enhancing the accessibility of grocery shopping. Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian, though. It's quite diverse with immigrants and their children from first and second generations. Many large businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but there's also a recently renovated park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a child-friendly water fountain. NYC parks are diverse, and you'll see a mix of people getting along well. There aren’t many corporate buildings here; most are co-op or condo apartments, with two-family houses predominant. Most residents are friendly, but the neighborhood can be noisy, especially from cars blasting music or accelerating through the streets. At night, keep your guard up as the neighborhood is generally safe but can be unpredictable with people starting trouble, bullies, and thieves. I've been bullied in the past through physical assault, and package theft occurs too. Morning commutes can be unpleasant due to dog waste on sidewalks. Keep your shoes clean!",
            "The sidewalks are scarce around here, and my house sits atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood, earning it the nickname \"workout hill\" for the joggers who love to run uphill daily. The streets are pot-holed and somewhat treacherous, and a lot of telephone and electric wires look worn out from the frequent rainfall and storms. The constant repairs make them look like a patchwork quilt. Tall evergreen trees abound, but the locals don't much appreciate them; they block the ocean view and obstruct the view of the bay. As a result, many houses are built high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories. At sunset, the water glows and the sky turns orange, but it's often cloudy, and the view is usually obscured by a haze. Moss grows on everything it can, including cars and railings. I once left my car parked for a month and it was covered in moss when I returned. It took me three hours to scrape it off. There aren't many children around, but there's a school nearby, and the neighborhood is populated mostly by older folks and retirees. Instead of kids, the locals have dogs; they're often seen in people's lawns or racing down the street. Occasionally, a dog might sneak into someone's house if a door or window is left open. Rabbits are a common sight, and gardeners dislike them because they damage plants and dig up lawns. My cats have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. Birds are also abundant, ranging from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle, which gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. There aren't many stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, you'll find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't very wide, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the other shore through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, so we experience a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but overall, it's a quiet neighborhood. The folks around here are rather permanent, and I've grown familiar with most of them. They keep themselves busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we make use of the hill on our side street for sledding. Our house is situated at the front corner of our street, so we observe everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the cars that drive around. Whenever we see an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors engage in walking for exercise or to walk their dogs, while the kids enjoy riding their bikes. We spend a significant amount of time at home since we work from there. My wife and I have two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, so we're a familiar sight to the neighbors. We enjoy going outside to play, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we'll grill on our back deck, and the smell from the barbecue is always pleasant. Lawn mowers are a common sound from March to October as the grass grows, and we enjoy the smell of burning leaves in the Fall, which indicates the arrival of the season. Recently, we've had a long Fall as the winter has been minimal. Our garage is at the rear of the house, so we use the front door mainly when someone knocks, which doesn't happen often. I like to work on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, the neighborhood is quiet. Thanksgiving and other similar events bring in extra cars as families from out of town visit. Overall, I enjoy living here, and if it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where the only color you see is brown. Unless you've been here, you won't understand how it feels to see dirt everywhere, and when you do see a green lawn, you know that person's spending a mint on lawn care. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered all over the place, but now it's mostly the same, with a bunch of new additions. It's starting to look like a city, but I guess that's how most places are changing these days. The people are generally friendly, but it's like any city - you've got your good parts and bad. I live among a bunch of friendly old folks, so I'd say it's a nice neighborhood.\n\nThe stores here are mostly chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale shopping, you'll have to travel. I've never seen a Whole Foods or anything like that around here. The most common jobs are construction - it's because this city's still not fully developed, so there's plenty of open space to build on. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not looking to go back. Speaking of construction, that's where my full-time job is - I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love about my home is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for its stark beauty, and the unique ecosystems created by the climate and topography. We have a bunch of different animals here, and my kids are obsessed with them. Right now, they're outside trying to catch lizards and desert bugs.\n\nAs for attractions, Victorville's a great place for families to experience the desert. If you can, try to visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. It's the perfect mix of activities and fun. Plus, you can pop over to Wrightwood and enjoy the snow-covered mountains. If you're interested in natural history and culture, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's got geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When it comes to what I consider my neighborhood, I'm sure my answer is a bit unconventional. Unlike others who might talk about their own home and community, I look at my neighborhood as the college campus I reside on, with the people living in my dormitory as my community. While the surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent, it has several similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, it's important to clarify the types of housing I encounter. There are three primary types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories.\n\nIn the apartments, you'll typically find between 2 to 4 people per room, with about 4 to 6 rooms per floor. A building that houses about 2 floors can accommodate around 20 people. The next type is the actual houses available for rent to those affiliated with the school. These are usually 2 to 4-bedroom setups, often occupied by alumni. Though less common, they are scattered throughout the neighborhood. Lastly, the dormitory-style housing, which houses hundreds of students, is the most prevalent type. In these, two people share a room as the norm, with some exceptions.\n\nNow, let's talk about the people who make up this neighborhood. My school prides itself on diversity, and that's reflected in the residents of my neighborhood. You'll find people from various cultures and age groups. Professional staff tend to live in the houses, younger students in the dormitories, and older students in the apartment-style housing.\n\nMoving on to the stores and parks, my neighborhood has a variety of dining options, the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores, and even a playground for the diverse community. Anything you might need is within walking distance. The park is kept clean and safe by the community, much like any other neighborhood.",
            "Well, let me tell you, I've been hanging around here for about a decade now, so I guess I can spill the beans on what I've learned. First off, I was pretty bummed when I first rolled into Stockbridge. I came from Riverdale, and I'll be honest, I missed it something fierce. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a neighborhood that was supposedly \"not ghetto\" and had a better high school. It took some time to adjust, but I eventually made some new friends and even a few enemies at school. I never got to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his crew next door, and Dennis for a bit. They've been great, and I mean that. I even caught Ms. Veda's bouquet at Mr. Glen's wedding! I miss those times. I wish I could share more about the neighborhood, but it's like a maze, and now I've got a GPS so I can take my time exploring it. I've only made it as far as hanging out with Kason and Curtis, and we'd play video games and live life to the fullest. There's also a park where I go to relax and enjoy nature, which helps me unwind. Sometimes I'll bring my bokken sword and practice my balance. I've got a basketball and tennis court too, even though I haven't played in years. My dad and Mr. Graves used to drill us in tennis, and we always had a blast. There's a lot of good times I've had here, and I'm looking forward to many more.",
            "My living situation in the neighborhood is quite convenient since it's close to the college I attend. I live in an apartment building that's surrounded by a few restaurants and bars. One of the bars recently got a new name, and it's a bit pricier than the others, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The people here are mostly either college students or lower-income individuals, which makes the atmosphere relaxed. There's an elementary school nearby, and while I don't know my neighbors, I don't mind since they tend to smoke a lot of weed. The management has put an air freshener unit outside their apartment, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, though it might be seen as rude. The buildings around me are mostly old, but some have been renovated. Down the street, there are newer apartment buildings, but they seem cheaply constructed and overpriced, likely due to their proximity to campus. There's a budget-friendly restaurant about five minutes away, serving food on paper plates, and most of it is microwaved. Across from it is a gas station known for its poor working conditions. However, the road was recently redone with city funds, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, and while some were cut down, there are still quite a few. Behind my apartment complex is another row of trees, followed by more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street right behind it, which is not as pleasant due to its dilapidated sidewalks and shabby buildings. There are a lot of trees on 43rd Street, likely to hide the buildings' condition. Crime is present in the area, particularly at the apartment complex on that street, but I can't point the finger at just them. There are also apartments across from me with similar issues. Despite this, I like my living situation as it's affordable and offers easy access to amenities, including the university and two bus stops for easy travel.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced out here and there to give the impression of individual homes. Most of the time, they're painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Nearly everyone in the neighborhood is friends with each other. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of the not-so-planned driveway, chatting while the neighborhood kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing change from our modern, tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. Surrounding us are fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and white clouds. The big downside? We've been under tornado warnings this season, and last night, we even heard the sirens. So, I found myself in my bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, going from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sun emerged and it started to rain, followed by a double rainbow. I grabbed my camera to share the sight with friends and family, who were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before folks started coming home. Then it was back to normal, with mothers and children outside as dinner cooked. It's a great neighborhood for this gal from New Hampshire who recently moved to North Carolina. I love the southern accents here. My place is a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else's. On the outside, all the houses look the same, but the apartments inside vary in size. Some are quite small, which doesn't make sense to me. I enjoy walking through the big field behind my place and strolling down to the pond, not meant for swimming. I've spotted deer and heard the giant bullfrog's morning song. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by rooster crows from nearby farms, making it feel like a small village community. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that lets us know he's there with his evening bray. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was tough at first, but I ended up bonding with a guy living two houses down and another one on my street. They aren't here anymore, but the memories stay. The people who were here when I first moved are still around. My neighborhood is pretty standard for an American suburb; it's got lots of two-story houses. Weekends or whenever it's warm outside, you hear kids playing. Most days are quiet, and I've never had any problems with neighbors. They leave you alone unless you need help. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one snatched off my porch. I trust my neighbors. There's a park a couple minutes away where I've played basketball, football, and baseball with my neighbors. I have some bad memories there too, like getting elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good ones outweigh the bad. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're younger and love playing on swings and slides. Visiting the park makes me nostalgic. The neighborhood is diverse. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a one-mile radius. People these days mostly use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food places are common, and there are plenty of pizza joints. Stores have everything you need. There are several dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're into homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm happy with my neighborhood. Seeing horror stories about other people's neighborhoods on social media makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town in South Carolina. It doesn't jump out from the crowd, but it's got a significant impact in the agriculture sector. Johnston, as it's known, proudly boasts its status as the Peach Capital of the World on the welcoming sign. The town is mostly made up of farmland where peach trees and cattle are the dominant sights. Houses are scattered and typically have metal roofs to withstand the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. Most of these houses are a distance from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the main town area, there's a single four-way stop with a stoplight. This is where you'll find the only stores in town. There are a few places to get \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; Gary's, a small burger chain; and a now-closed pizzeria. There's also Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy best known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, a small grocery store, is called IGA. While it's the only grocery store in town, many people prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General, which offers a wide range of everyday items and is always busy. There's also a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. Attached is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomers offering services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are located away from the main town area; they are small but well-equipped. The town only has a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School, and students must attend middle and high school in the next town over. There are no parks, but they're working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide more opportunities for families and attract visitors. There's not much to do in town; no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or many restaurants. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small that you could pass through without realizing it!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who've gone missing. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I couldn't believe it—neither had any of my friends. It's a struggle, that's for sure. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep thinking about it. It's expensive, but we've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market finds and well-loved clothes. It's like the smell of adulthood, one that sticks even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can shop at two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it inside the thrift stores. No matter how busy it is outside, the stores are always quiet. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there seem to be more and more people and cars flooding the city. It's a developing place, they say. With one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery headquartered here, it's showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals and nobody asks too much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where showing too much concern means you care. Here, people don't pry into each other's lives. You can maintain your privacy as long as you like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. With the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty well. I try to be considerate and leave them food, and they do the same. I bring mail for them, and they do for me. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't totally ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home is what you might expect from a typical cookie cutter suburb. A homeowner's association rules the roost here, and it shows in the pristine condition of everything. Front yards are uniform with a small patch of grass, a bit of decorative pebbles, and a short driveway. Some houses even have small trees. Everyone's got a two-car garage, and the streets are all freshly paved with no potholes in sight. The houses are mostly single story, though every now and then you'll see a two-story one. We don't have individual mailboxes like you'd find at some places. Instead, there's a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street, with two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's obsession with uniformity is evident here. My neighborhood is right at the edge of a nearby city, which makes it a mix of rural and suburban living. We've got plenty of land for everything. Multiple community pools are well-maintained and gated, and there are walking trails for dog walks or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park to get your exercise. The neighborhood is big enough to run around for some good exercise. Most people here are retired, but there are some middle-aged and young professionals mixed in too. The city itself is large by population but has a small-town feel. All the amenities you'd expect are here, like a mall that's not huge but gets the job done. It's just a 15-minute drive to get to more significant places, and once there, you've got high-end grocery stores and bargain outlets. All in all, it's a safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical neighborhood. We've got nice things like pools and walking trails, and while we're not next door to any major shopping, a short drive gets you to any major chain you need.",
            "I live in a cozy Midwestern town nestled just outside a bustling metropolis. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is the town's most economically challenged area. Still, it's not unpleasant, and my neighbors are generally warm and welcoming. While crime rates are slightly higher, overall, it's quite low. We've had a few incidents, including a shooting and a homicide nearby, but my family hasn't been directly affected, aside from some minor thefts from our porch. The opioid epidemic has taken a toll on the town, but there are plenty of resources to combat it, like addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions. Despite these challenges, our town has plenty of positives. My son's elementary school is fantastic, with a supportive staff and a positive atmosphere. The PTO organizes great events, and they provide free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The City Council has made improvements, like repaving roads and refurbishing parks, but these mainly target the central and western parts of town, leaving the east side feeling neglected. Still, I enjoy living here. The people are friendly, the schools are top-notch, and our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture and history. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with a story to tell. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill is a cool little arcade bar that attracts all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you'll often see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's quite spacious for the part of town it's in. Concrete encircles the park, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains heavily, making it tough to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together and in the city center, they can keep warm and are also near the family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city isn't the old buildings or the architecture that dots the rolling hills towards the ocean. It's the people who make my neighborhood their home. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence, with federal officials and the DEA sweeping through to clean the streets. The stories live on, even three decades later. The people here work hard to keep their neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their city and on their block. They warn that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop at night. That warning echoes the past, tinged with social conditioning. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to pass for not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, who feels the constant reminders of our nation's problems. It's a place where I feel alive walking the streets at night, meeting people who offer a jacket more often than to rob me. It's where laundromat owners stay open late so I can charge my phone on rainy nights. It's a place where I can sit, feeling invisible, on grey and dreary nights at the mercy of the concrete store fronts, only to have someone stop and hand me $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I reside in Rural America, nestled in a small Michigan town. Here, you transition from farmland to quaint tourist spots, with no big city malls, Wal-marts, or Applebee's in sight. Everything is a drive away. Yet, I'm blessed to call one of the most scenic places in the world home, surrounded by magnificent bodies of water - Lake Michigan to the east and Lake Charlevoix to the west. Everywhere you go, there's a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood embodies small-town living. Houses are unique, not cookie-cutter; many have basements visible from the road, and a mix of older aluminum siding and vibrant colors. Most homes have yards with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. It's a Middle America feel, reflecting hardworking folks building a life here. Kids zoom up and down the streets, neighbors wave, and dogs are walked or biked nearby. Lawns are well-kept, with no leaf piles and neatly trimmed plants. It's not a showy neighborhood, but a peaceful, safe haven perfect for raising a family. Nearby, you'll find the county sheriff's department, health department, recycling center, and baseball/softball fields. Our small-town airport is close by, and you'll hear small planes taking off and landing. A short walk leads to an ice cream parlor, and if you're up for it, downtown is just a bike ride away. It's a truly wonderful place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a bustling big city, with a neighborhood that's as diverse as it gets. Residential areas are scattered among commercial districts, where you'll find all sorts of businesses - offices, stores, eateries, and entertainment spots. There's no shortage of places to eat or shop, ranging from giant corporate stores to cozy boutiques that line up along the streets, often within walking distance from peaceful neighborhoods. We've got a couple of nearby parks too, always filled with families and their young ones. The people here are a mix of folks - there's a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish group, and refugees/immigrants from the Soviet Union right in my neighborhood. Just a bit further out, you'll find enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, all within a few miles' radius. But don't let that fool you - a 10-mile drive can easily take an hour or two due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours. Few people walk around here; the city's so large that people prefer to commute by car. This means traffic's a nightmare, and parking's nearly impossible. Despite all this, there's been a lot of construction lately, with new apartment buildings popping up like mushrooms. While it's a popular destination, residents aren't thrilled about the prospect of more people and cars. We have all sorts of houses too - single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings. People of all ages live here, and I barely know most of my neighbors. It's not the tight-knit community it used to be when I was a kid, where I'd play outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends close to my age.",
            "My neighborhood is quite unique. Most of the houses here are single-family homes, but a few have been divided into two units, still attached to each other. My home has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. Like many others, our neighborhood is a reminder of the time when life in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once seemed to unify the people, but now it feels like it's slipping away. My neighborhood, along with many others, still clings to this dream, attracting visitors who feel it's still alive. Though the optimism of the past seems to have faded, and the upkeep of the yards has slackened, there's still a car in every driveway and kids playing as if the world revolves around them. The public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth and stir up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Each home has its own character, yet they all feel the same. There's a massive supermarket called \"Super A\" owned by a large Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are spacious, and kids play football, pausing only for passing cars. Most residents have been here for generations, and many can spin tales of a past where everyone knew everyone. A karate school once operated here, but with the waning popularity of karate kid movies, it closed. Now it's a pharmacy, as many believe drugs can solve all problems. There's also a small movie theater that plays old films at discounted prices, attracting the elderly who enjoy a night out without the kids. A single expressway runs through our town, with the entrance and exit in the neighboring town. There was a petition to bring the exit to our town, but the elders opposed it, fearing it would ruin our community. They convinced the city council to reject the request. A new high school is being built, and we're debating a mascot. I suggest a cybernetic cowboy with a log cabin.",
            "You might walk right past it without a second glance - after all, it's just a residential area behind a shopping strip, not the kind of place most people would think to look for a place to live. Behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels only occupied occasionally for family reunions, there's a whole bustling community. Amidst these communities, down the road, there are a few apartment complexes nestled together like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully pulled apart and lined up. The first apartments you come across are those that have been featured in the news for some unsavory activities, so we won't dwell on those too much. But the apartments next to that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole different story, almost unknown to anyone living in the area. Across from these complexes stands a community college's satellite campus, a quiet, sleepy set of buildings where students saunter in with coffee in hand at 7 in the morning to start their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters honk and groan at the traffic delays on days with higher attendance. The road intersects another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those who've broken bones on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that whirls the warm, thick summer air. Children play cartwheels and pirouettes across the prickly grass in the park, while bees lazily buzz around the flower patches. Elderly folks stroll their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding at the girls gathered by the playground equipment, discussing boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park with inexpensive yet not too busy food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon in between. You can fill your pool while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken - the perks of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt place where teens often cling to cold, sweating cups of DIY frozen yogurt covered in toppings while doing tricks on their skateboards and vaping because they think it's cool. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where not much ever changes, not even time.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked, driving past the corn fields that stretched out before us. “This is it!” I replied, knowing she’d be taken aback by the vast openness. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a 5-minute walk from her house - she'd never seen this much space. The corn fields were a sight to behold, and I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio. As we drove along the two-lane country road, we passed a quarry filled with water, and just beyond that, the small development where I lived. The houses here were mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land, which everyone took pride in maintaining. During spring, these driveways would be lined with the finest Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, gleaming after a thorough wash. Continuing towards my grey stucco home, I’d always see my Korean neighbor out, with a friendly face, spending the day tending to his lawn. He’d be singing over the hum of his mower, and everyone in the neighborhood would laugh, but he was always genuine and had an intriguing history. Once a doctor, he now spends his days blending in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nReaching my home, we found a side yard filled with geese being chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream fed into the quarry, where you could hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge, there was an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent my childhood, building tree forts and “hunting” animals, which usually just meant chasing them. The winters here could be brutally cold, transforming the yard into a barren wilderness. Bare trees, once adorned with vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers, would turn into skeletal structures. Snowball fights were our favorite winter activity, with my sister and me building igloo-like forts to house our arsenal. In our winter wonderland, we’d play pretend, carefree and happy, without a worry in the world.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a place that's all about embracing the strange. The unofficial town motto, as proudly displayed on a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club (all while skirting the law on a few of these), is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some people see it as a nod to Portland's creative and unique culture from the 90's and early 2000's, a time when the city was still relatively unknown and cheaper. For others, it's an invitation to join in the weirdness, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of apartment complexes to house them, Portland still holds onto its weirdness. Weird doesn't mean being open to everything, but it does mean being open to things that are unusual. Weird doesn't mean we're without modern conveniences or modern problems. We buy most of our stuff from China, just like the rest of the country. Portland has a million ways to be weird, to be not normal, but it also has plenty of normalcy. There's yoga and hipsters and business professionals galore. Maybe weird means we just don't take everything so seriously. In my neighborhood, like many in Portland, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes are traditionally old cardboard boxes with items someone is giving away, but they can be plastic bags or boxes too. They contain magical treasures just waiting for the person who wanders by. They often have clothes and books, but they can have anything. Wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about for me, but I'm just one variety of weird among countless others. Some people I live with would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga or support the city's soccer team, the Timbers. Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things and are full of dreams. Yes, Portland has a drug problem, which is often rooted in mental health issues. The constant rainy weather and dreary clouds don't help matters. Portland also has a homelessness problem, which no one seems to know how to tackle. Social services are better here than in many places, but they're still lacking. The homeless population is drawn by Portland's services, but our efforts are insufficient, just like everywhere else. The non-homeless population swings between concern and hatred. In this, we're not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there, standing tall and steadfast in the north. They bear witness to the sun's daily rise and fall, and no matter how busy life and work become, they remain unchanging and unperturbed. On days when I feel most stressed and overwhelmed, they call to me, and when I turn to them, they offer a place of solace and strength to carry on, one day at a time. I first encountered these mountains when I moved here for undergrad, and they were instantly captivating. While the university and town have their own charms, it's the mountains that truly capture my heart. The town itself is beautiful with its own unique blend of old and new. There are countless cafes where many hours were spent with books and friends, and the downtown area offers a vibrant atmosphere with its historic brick buildings and bustling restaurants. This urban energy gives way to a quieter, more serene small-town feel just a short walk away, with the library serving as a dividing line between the two. This contrast of environments makes the city feel inviting, like a puzzle just waiting to be explored. Memories are made in each part of town, from late-night walks in the park with friends to catching a movie in the fancy theater provided by the university. However, it's not all sunshine and roses. The town is also home to many tough memories, and the ponds can serve as a place for reflection and even crying sessions, especially during existential crises. Watching the turtles and ducks go about their days has often left me questioning my own purpose in life. But after a while, I'd walk past the pond, park, and the familiar houses, until I reached a main street. There, the sun would cast its golden rays upon the palm trees, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they stood, as they always had, the mountains reaching up to the sky, their presence a beacon of unyielding strength. They spoke to me of perseverance, reminding me to carry on, one step at a time.",
            "If you're thinking of visiting Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it! Public transit is readily available and a favorite among New Yorkers. Bensonhurt is pretty urban, so you'll feel right at home in the city. While you're there, expect to see plenty of Asian stores. Over the past 20 years, Bensonhurt has become a hotspot for Asians, with Asian-owned businesses everywhere. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common, and they're beloved by locals for their quality products and lower prices. I live nearby and can vouch for the convenience—there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other! But Bensonhurt isn't just Asian; it's very diverse, with immigrants, first-gen, and second-gen residents. Most major businesses are owned by Asians, and there's even a recently renovated park nearby with basketball and soccer fields, handball courts, swings, a kid-friendly playground, and a water fountain. New York's parks are diverse, and Bensonhurt is no exception. Most folks are nice, but it can get pretty noisy. Cars are often blaring music, and early morning gas revving can wake you up. After dark, stay alert; while Bensonhurt is generally safe, it can be unpredictable. I've had past experiences with bullying and package theft, but these incidents are rare. Dog waste is a common issue; you'll see plenty on your way to the train or supermarket. Keep your shoes clean, folks!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks around here. My house sits right at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, earning it the moniker \"work out hill\" for all the joggers who hit it daily. Since sidewalks are non-existent, everyone walks on the road. The road's in pretty bad shape, with a few potholes that make driving a bit of a challenge. The telephone and electric wires are a mess too, constantly being repaired due to the frequent storms and fallen branches, making them look like a patchwork quilt. Evergreen trees dot the landscape, but locals aren't fond of them, cutting down as many as possible to clear the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill to take in the view of the bay, with large glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets here are stunning, with the water lighting up and the sky turning orange. But most days are cloudy and damp, with moss covering roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month and had to spend three hours scraping off the moss. Kids are few and far between, but there's a school nearby. Most people are older, retired, with dogs being the common \"children\" in the neighborhood. Leave a door or window open, and you might find a dog in your living room. Rabbits run wild around the area, digging up gardens and lawns, much to the gardeners' dismay. My cats love them though, keeping most of them away. We get the usual birds too, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle chased off by neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but a hike downhill to the waterfront has a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. There's not much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shoreline even through the mist on most days.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many folks move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live here. Everyone keeps themselves busy with yard work and other daily chores. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we take note of it. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you'd expect from a quiet neighborhood. We're home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, myself, my wife, and two daughters aged eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Every now and then we grill outside on our back deck, and the smell of barbecue is always pleasant. It seems like there's always someone cutting grass around here, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through October when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's plenty of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the fall as well. That means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I love the smell of burning leaves, so it's always a nice sign that fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks on it, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town, and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. The same goes for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where dirt is as far as the eye can see. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the feeling of always seeing brown. When you do see a lawn, it means someone's dropping a fortune on lawn care. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide, but now it's the same story with new additions popping up. The place looks more like a city every day, but I guess that's how most places change. Most of the time, people are friendly, but like any city, there are good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so I suppose it's a nice part of town. The stores here are mostly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale shopping, you've got to travel. I've never seen a Whole Foods or any store like that here. The jobs that stand out the most are in construction, probably because this city is still developing, with plenty of open spaces to build on. That makes me a little nervous, as I like things just the way they are now. I came from a big city and there's no way I'm going back. Speaking of construction, that's what I do for a living. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about my home is the variety of animals. People come here for the stark beauty of the desert, and the unique ecosystems created by the climate and topology. We've managed to coexist with the wildlife well. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. As for attractions, we have some, and Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. If you're lucky, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood for snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's got geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the area's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm guessing my answer is a bit unique. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their own personal lives, my situation's a tad different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus I call home, and the people living in my dormitory to be my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser degree. Despite this peculiarity, there are common threads with conventional neighborhood life. Just like any other neighborhood, mine has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by talking about the houses that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, it's crucial to clarify the types of housing you'll find. We have apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, you'll usually find 2-4 people in each room, with around 4-6 rooms per floor. A typical building can house about 20 people. Next, there are actual houses available for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. These are 2-4 bedroom setups, often occupied by alumni. However, there are only a few of these scattered throughout the neighborhood due to efficiency concerns. Lastly, there are dormitory-style rooms that house hundreds of students. Here, two people share a room, with a few exceptions. This is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school emphasizes diversity, and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. People from all cultures and ages call this place home. Professional staff typically live in houses within the neighborhood, while newer students live in dorm-style housing and older students in apartment-style housing. It's hard to do justice to the people in this neighborhood, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since the school is self-contained, it has a wealth of stores and a single park. You'll find a mix of dining options and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. Anything you need can be found within the neighborhood's boundaries! Plus, the park is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, kept clean and free of crime by its residents!",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only gone so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, which is why I enjoy living here. While there are mainly apartment buildings, a few restaurants and bars nearby provide fun nights out without breaking the bank. One of the bars recently got a name change and became more pricey, but the service and drinks aren’t too bad. The majority of people here are either college students or lower-income residents, which is reflected in the affordable housing. There's an elementary school within walking distance, adding to the neighborhood's lively atmosphere. My neighbors and I don’t interact much, but they don’t bother me. The building management even placed an air freshener near their door to combat the frequent marijuana smoke, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings in my area are mostly old, but some have been spruced up from the inside. Down the road, new apartment buildings have popped up, but their construction quality is questionable despite the high rent, all thanks to their prime campus location. There’s a cheap eatery nearby that serves food on paper plates and mostly microwaves its offerings. Across from it is a gas station, known for poor work conditions, but the city improved the street and sidewalks last year, making the area more pleasant. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street but 43rd street behind it isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are in poor condition, and the buildings look shabby. Many trees line this street, possibly to conceal the buildings' appearance. While crime happens at the apartments on 43rdstreet, I can’t single them out as the sole culprits. There are also problematic apartments across from mine with a transient population. Despite the challenges, I like where I live; it's affordable, and there are convenient amenities nearby, especially the university and bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a cul-de-sac lined with duplexes that look like standalone homes, each painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most neighbors are friends, and we often gather at the end of the street to chat while kids play. It's like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees, and blue skies with white clouds. This year, we're experiencing tornado warnings, and last night, we heard sirens. I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my little dog and a few pillows, while my bigger dog barked from the living room. The storm left the road steaming as the temperature dropped from 92 to 75. Hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. After the storm, a double rainbow appeared, and I snapped some photos to share with my friends and family. The neighborhood was quiet for an hour before people started returning home. Business as usual resumed, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. I love the southern accent here; it's a gem of a place to live, forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by rooster crows, and we have a donkey braying in the evening. I was fortunate to find this cozy community.",
            "I moved here right before starting eighth grade. Making friends was tough at first, but I eventually hit it off with a buddy who lived two doors down and another guy on my street. They've since moved away, but the memories linger. The folks who've been here since I moved are still around, for the most part. Our neighborhood's pretty standard for suburban America, filled with two-story homes. Weekends and warm days bring kids playing outside, and it's usually quiet the rest of the time. I've never had issues with my neighbors, and I'd say I can trust them. A park a few minutes from my house holds many memories - basketball, football, baseball games, and even my worst memory, a painful elbow to the nose during a game. Today, I go there to bond with my cousin's kids, who love the swings and slides. The park fills me with nostalgia. Our neighborhood's diverse, with a variety of cuisines within a mile - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. Nowadays, folks often use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered. We've got all the stores you need, from dry cleaners to pharmacies, a grocery store, and even an Indian-owned shop for some authentic cuisine. In comparison to other places I've read about, I consider myself fortunate for my neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is one of those small towns you might find scattered around South Carolina. It's nothing extraordinary, but it sure has a knack for peaches and farming, which is why Johnston is proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town's welcome sign proudly boasts this title, and it's not hard to understand why. Most of the land around here is covered in peach orchards or cattle fields. Houses are spaced out, often two stories with either metal roofs to keep the summer sun at bay or gray shingles. They're usually not positioned near the road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the main part of town, there's a solitary traffic light at a four-way intersection, and that's where you'll find all the stores! There's a quaint little Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, a Fiesta Mexican spot, Gary's burger joint (which has a limited menu but is quite popular), and Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small pharmacy famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. You'll also find a small, upscale grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, and a Dollar General store that's bustling from morning till night. There's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a kind woman who's well-respected in the community, and attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that offers daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. The town has a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, and students have to travel to the next town for middle and high school. There are no parks yet, but they're planning a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide more opportunities for families and attract visitors. Despite the lack of large stores, restaurants, or parks, it's a tight-knit community that makes you feel like you're part of something special!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. I was taken aback, seeing that almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Maybe it's because of the struggle we're all facing. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, given how expensive things are. But we've become frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell less in adulthood. You might pick up a cigarette or just get used to the way things are. But the flea market always has its place. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano, wedging itself into the leather and lingering even after you wash it. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting on the far side, you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but you wouldn't hear that in the thrifts. No matter the crowd, the stores are eerily silent. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Each year, the city swells with more and more people. It's a developing city, they say, with one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and you can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned means you care deeply. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can maintain your privacy for as long as you like, and the city will just flow around you like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn together, and help each other out when we can. I'm lucky to be here. I get along well with most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty well too. I make sure to clean after myself and leave them food, and they do the same. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The area where I reside is a quintessential cookie-cutter suburb, with a homeowner's association that's evident right away. Upon entering, you'll see a uniform grid of well-maintained single-family homes, thanks to the HOA. The front yards are all similar, with small patches of landscaped grass, a smattering of decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you might spot a small tree. Every household boasts a two-car garage. As you drive along the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete streets without any potholes, ensuring a smooth drive. Most homes are single-story, but every now and then, you'll find a two-story. Mailboxes are communal, with a large grouping at the end of the street, each requiring a key for access. There are also two larger lockers for packages, a system that keeps the community uniform, thanks to the HOA. My house is located on the outskirts of a nearby city, offering a blend of rural and suburban living with ample space. There are multiple community pools and walking trails for dog walks or leisurely strolls. The community is large enough that running around it provides plenty of exercise. The neighborhood is primarily retirement homes but also has a scattering of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is large in population but retains a small-town feel. We've got all the amenities you'd expect, such as one mall, no enormous but functional, with stores ranging from high-end grocery outlets to bargain outlets with limited staff. Everything is within a 15-minute drive, making it easy to get to major chains. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, with nice things like pools and walking trails, and while it's not right next to shopping, a car ride away will get you to any major chain you need.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town, practically on the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side, is the most economically underprivileged area. Most houses are rented by or owned by low-income individuals, but it's not unpleasant to live here. Neighbors here are generally friendly and wave hello as I walk down the street. Crime rates are a bit higher, with a few violent incidents, including shootings and one homicide, within a few blocks of my home over the past decade. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Our family has had no direct involvement with crime apart from a few missing items from our porch. The town has been heavily impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Despite this, there are numerous resources to combat the epidemic, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions. My son's elementary school is excellent, with wonderful staff and no bullying due to his special needs. The PTO plans family events to enhance involvement and educational progress. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The City Council has improved the town's appearance, with road repaving, landscaping, and park refurbishing, mostly in the center and on the west side. The east side, where I live, is often neglected. Overall, I enjoy living here with friendly people, great schools, adequate shopping, and a comfortable home. We've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hub, nestled on a hill and surrounded by historical buildings. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old live theater, and just a block down is a cool little arcade bar that attracts all sorts of people on warm summer nights, often forming a line of eager patrons. A few blocks up, there's a spacious city park with concrete walls and tall steps. During winter, homeless people set up their tents along the sidewalks and steps for warmth. It doesn't snow much, but the rain can be intense, making it challenging to stay warm. They're close to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the iconic buildings; it's the people and their culture. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, but the residents work hard to keep it clean, and the stories of those days are still passed down. It might be considered one of the rougher 'hoods,' but the people care about their city and block. The warning not to walk around Hilltop after dark, often given to white people, is a reminder of the past and social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have offered me a jacket more times than tried to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners stayed open late so I could charge my phone, and where I've sat, feeling invisible, only to be acknowledged and given $5 by a stranger who told me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call rural Michigan my home, nestled between farmlands and charming tourist towns. There's no big city shopping, no Walmart or Target, not even an Applebee's. Everywhere you need to go, you drive. But I'm lucky to live in one of Mother Nature's most breathtaking spots, with Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix on my doorstep. Anywhere you go, there's a beach waiting. My neighborhood is classic small-town America. Houses aren't stacked, they're unique, with basements visible from the road. You'll find aluminum-siding homes of every color, with yards full of trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for furry friends. These are homes of hardworking folks who've raised or are raising families. Kids are always out running around, neighbors wave and walk their dogs, bikes, and rollerblades, while lawns are kept neat and tidy. It's not a fancy neighborhood, but a peaceful, safe one perfect for raising a family. The county sheriff's department and jail are nearby, along with the health department, recycling center, and sports fields. You can hear planes taking off and landing at our small airport. Ice cream is a short walk away, and downtown is just a bike ride. It's a great place to live, a place you can tell is perfect for a family."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a bustling big city, with a neighborhood that's as diverse as it gets. Residential areas are scattered among commercial districts, where you'll find all sorts of businesses - offices, stores, eateries, and entertainment spots. There's no shortage of places to eat or shop, ranging from giant corporate stores to cozy boutiques that line up along the streets, often within walking distance from peaceful neighborhoods. We've got a couple of nearby parks too, always filled with families and their young ones. The people here are a mix of folks - there's a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish group, and refugees/immigrants from the Soviet Union right in my neighborhood. Just a bit further out, you'll find enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, all within a few miles' radius. But don't let that fool you - a 10-mile drive can easily take an hour or two due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours. Few people walk around here; the city's so large that people prefer to commute by car. This means traffic's a nightmare, and parking's nearly impossible. Despite all this, there's been a lot of construction lately, with new apartment buildings popping up like mushrooms. While it's a popular destination, residents aren't thrilled about the prospect of more people and cars. We have all sorts of houses too - single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings. People of all ages live here, and I barely know most of my neighbors. It's not the tight-knit community it used to be when I was a kid, where I'd play outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends close to my age.",
            "My neighborhood is quite unique. Most of the houses here are single-family homes, but a few have been divided into two units, still attached to each other. My home has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. Like many others, our neighborhood is a reminder of the time when life in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once seemed to unify the people, but now it feels like it's slipping away. My neighborhood, along with many others, still clings to this dream, attracting visitors who feel it's still alive. Though the optimism of the past seems to have faded, and the upkeep of the yards has slackened, there's still a car in every driveway and kids playing as if the world revolves around them. The public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth and stir up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Each home has its own character, yet they all feel the same. There's a massive supermarket called \"Super A\" owned by a large Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are spacious, and kids play football, pausing only for passing cars. Most residents have been here for generations, and many can spin tales of a past where everyone knew everyone. A karate school once operated here, but with the waning popularity of karate kid movies, it closed. Now it's a pharmacy, as many believe drugs can solve all problems. There's also a small movie theater that plays old films at discounted prices, attracting the elderly who enjoy a night out without the kids. A single expressway runs through our town, with the entrance and exit in the neighboring town. There was a petition to bring the exit to our town, but the elders opposed it, fearing it would ruin our community. They convinced the city council to reject the request. A new high school is being built, and we're debating a mascot. I suggest a cybernetic cowboy with a log cabin.",
            "You might walk right past it without a second glance - after all, it's just a residential area behind a shopping strip, not the kind of place most people would think to look for a place to live. Behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels only occupied occasionally for family reunions, there's a whole bustling community. Amidst these communities, down the road, there are a few apartment complexes nestled together like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully pulled apart and lined up. The first apartments you come across are those that have been featured in the news for some unsavory activities, so we won't dwell on those too much. But the apartments next to that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole different story, almost unknown to anyone living in the area. Across from these complexes stands a community college's satellite campus, a quiet, sleepy set of buildings where students saunter in with coffee in hand at 7 in the morning to start their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters honk and groan at the traffic delays on days with higher attendance. The road intersects another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those who've broken bones on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that whirls the warm, thick summer air. Children play cartwheels and pirouettes across the prickly grass in the park, while bees lazily buzz around the flower patches. Elderly folks stroll their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding at the girls gathered by the playground equipment, discussing boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park with inexpensive yet not too busy food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon in between. You can fill your pool while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken - the perks of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt place where teens often cling to cold, sweating cups of DIY frozen yogurt covered in toppings while doing tricks on their skateboards and vaping because they think it's cool. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where not much ever changes, not even time.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked, driving past the corn fields that stretched out before us. “This is it!” I replied, knowing she’d be taken aback by the vast openness. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a 5-minute walk from her house - she'd never seen this much space. The corn fields were a sight to behold, and I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio. As we drove along the two-lane country road, we passed a quarry filled with water, and just beyond that, the small development where I lived. The houses here were mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land, which everyone took pride in maintaining. During spring, these driveways would be lined with the finest Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, gleaming after a thorough wash. Continuing towards my grey stucco home, I’d always see my Korean neighbor out, with a friendly face, spending the day tending to his lawn. He’d be singing over the hum of his mower, and everyone in the neighborhood would laugh, but he was always genuine and had an intriguing history. Once a doctor, he now spends his days blending in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nReaching my home, we found a side yard filled with geese being chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream fed into the quarry, where you could hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge, there was an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent my childhood, building tree forts and “hunting” animals, which usually just meant chasing them. The winters here could be brutally cold, transforming the yard into a barren wilderness. Bare trees, once adorned with vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers, would turn into skeletal structures. Snowball fights were our favorite winter activity, with my sister and me building igloo-like forts to house our arsenal. In our winter wonderland, we’d play pretend, carefree and happy, without a worry in the world.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a place that's all about embracing the strange. The unofficial town motto, as proudly displayed on a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club (all while skirting the law on a few of these), is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some people see it as a nod to Portland's creative and unique culture from the 90's and early 2000's, a time when the city was still relatively unknown and cheaper. For others, it's an invitation to join in the weirdness, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of apartment complexes to house them, Portland still holds onto its weirdness. Weird doesn't mean being open to everything, but it does mean being open to things that are unusual. Weird doesn't mean we're without modern conveniences or modern problems. We buy most of our stuff from China, just like the rest of the country. Portland has a million ways to be weird, to be not normal, but it also has plenty of normalcy. There's yoga and hipsters and business professionals galore. Maybe weird means we just don't take everything so seriously. In my neighborhood, like many in Portland, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes are traditionally old cardboard boxes with items someone is giving away, but they can be plastic bags or boxes too. They contain magical treasures just waiting for the person who wanders by. They often have clothes and books, but they can have anything. Wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about for me, but I'm just one variety of weird among countless others. Some people I live with would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga or support the city's soccer team, the Timbers. Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things and are full of dreams. Yes, Portland has a drug problem, which is often rooted in mental health issues. The constant rainy weather and dreary clouds don't help matters. Portland also has a homelessness problem, which no one seems to know how to tackle. Social services are better here than in many places, but they're still lacking. The homeless population is drawn by Portland's services, but our efforts are insufficient, just like everywhere else. The non-homeless population swings between concern and hatred. In this, we're not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there, standing tall and steadfast in the north. They bear witness to the sun's daily rise and fall, and no matter how busy life and work become, they remain unchanging and unperturbed. On days when I feel most stressed and overwhelmed, they call to me, and when I turn to them, they offer a place of solace and strength to carry on, one day at a time. I first encountered these mountains when I moved here for undergrad, and they were instantly captivating. While the university and town have their own charms, it's the mountains that truly capture my heart. The town itself is beautiful with its own unique blend of old and new. There are countless cafes where many hours were spent with books and friends, and the downtown area offers a vibrant atmosphere with its historic brick buildings and bustling restaurants. This urban energy gives way to a quieter, more serene small-town feel just a short walk away, with the library serving as a dividing line between the two. This contrast of environments makes the city feel inviting, like a puzzle just waiting to be explored. Memories are made in each part of town, from late-night walks in the park with friends to catching a movie in the fancy theater provided by the university. However, it's not all sunshine and roses. The town is also home to many tough memories, and the ponds can serve as a place for reflection and even crying sessions, especially during existential crises. Watching the turtles and ducks go about their days has often left me questioning my own purpose in life. But after a while, I'd walk past the pond, park, and the familiar houses, until I reached a main street. There, the sun would cast its golden rays upon the palm trees, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they stood, as they always had, the mountains reaching up to the sky, their presence a beacon of unyielding strength. They spoke to me of perseverance, reminding me to carry on, one step at a time.",
            "If you're thinking of visiting Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it! Public transit is readily available and a favorite among New Yorkers. Bensonhurt is pretty urban, so you'll feel right at home in the city. While you're there, expect to see plenty of Asian stores. Over the past 20 years, Bensonhurt has become a hotspot for Asians, with Asian-owned businesses everywhere. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common, and they're beloved by locals for their quality products and lower prices. I live nearby and can vouch for the convenience—there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other! But Bensonhurt isn't just Asian; it's very diverse, with immigrants, first-gen, and second-gen residents. Most major businesses are owned by Asians, and there's even a recently renovated park nearby with basketball and soccer fields, handball courts, swings, a kid-friendly playground, and a water fountain. New York's parks are diverse, and Bensonhurt is no exception. Most folks are nice, but it can get pretty noisy. Cars are often blaring music, and early morning gas revving can wake you up. After dark, stay alert; while Bensonhurt is generally safe, it can be unpredictable. I've had past experiences with bullying and package theft, but these incidents are rare. Dog waste is a common issue; you'll see plenty on your way to the train or supermarket. Keep your shoes clean, folks!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks around here. My house sits right at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, earning it the moniker \"work out hill\" for all the joggers who hit it daily. Since sidewalks are non-existent, everyone walks on the road. The road's in pretty bad shape, with a few potholes that make driving a bit of a challenge. The telephone and electric wires are a mess too, constantly being repaired due to the frequent storms and fallen branches, making them look like a patchwork quilt. Evergreen trees dot the landscape, but locals aren't fond of them, cutting down as many as possible to clear the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill to take in the view of the bay, with large glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets here are stunning, with the water lighting up and the sky turning orange. But most days are cloudy and damp, with moss covering roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month and had to spend three hours scraping off the moss. Kids are few and far between, but there's a school nearby. Most people are older, retired, with dogs being the common \"children\" in the neighborhood. Leave a door or window open, and you might find a dog in your living room. Rabbits run wild around the area, digging up gardens and lawns, much to the gardeners' dismay. My cats love them though, keeping most of them away. We get the usual birds too, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle chased off by neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but a hike downhill to the waterfront has a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. There's not much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shoreline even through the mist on most days.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many folks move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live here. Everyone keeps themselves busy with yard work and other daily chores. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we take note of it. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you'd expect from a quiet neighborhood. We're home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, myself, my wife, and two daughters aged eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Every now and then we grill outside on our back deck, and the smell of barbecue is always pleasant. It seems like there's always someone cutting grass around here, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through October when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's plenty of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the fall as well. That means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I love the smell of burning leaves, so it's always a nice sign that fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks on it, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town, and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. The same goes for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where dirt is as far as the eye can see. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the feeling of always seeing brown. When you do see a lawn, it means someone's dropping a fortune on lawn care. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide, but now it's the same story with new additions popping up. The place looks more like a city every day, but I guess that's how most places change. Most of the time, people are friendly, but like any city, there are good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so I suppose it's a nice part of town. The stores here are mostly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale shopping, you've got to travel. I've never seen a Whole Foods or any store like that here. The jobs that stand out the most are in construction, probably because this city is still developing, with plenty of open spaces to build on. That makes me a little nervous, as I like things just the way they are now. I came from a big city and there's no way I'm going back. Speaking of construction, that's what I do for a living. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about my home is the variety of animals. People come here for the stark beauty of the desert, and the unique ecosystems created by the climate and topology. We've managed to coexist with the wildlife well. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. As for attractions, we have some, and Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. If you're lucky, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood for snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's got geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the area's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm guessing my answer is a bit unique. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their own personal lives, my situation's a tad different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus I call home, and the people living in my dormitory to be my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser degree. Despite this peculiarity, there are common threads with conventional neighborhood life. Just like any other neighborhood, mine has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by talking about the houses that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, it's crucial to clarify the types of housing you'll find. We have apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, you'll usually find 2-4 people in each room, with around 4-6 rooms per floor. A typical building can house about 20 people. Next, there are actual houses available for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. These are 2-4 bedroom setups, often occupied by alumni. However, there are only a few of these scattered throughout the neighborhood due to efficiency concerns. Lastly, there are dormitory-style rooms that house hundreds of students. Here, two people share a room, with a few exceptions. This is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school emphasizes diversity, and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. People from all cultures and ages call this place home. Professional staff typically live in houses within the neighborhood, while newer students live in dorm-style housing and older students in apartment-style housing. It's hard to do justice to the people in this neighborhood, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since the school is self-contained, it has a wealth of stores and a single park. You'll find a mix of dining options and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. Anything you need can be found within the neighborhood's boundaries! Plus, the park is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, kept clean and free of crime by its residents!",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only gone so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, which is why I enjoy living here. While there are mainly apartment buildings, a few restaurants and bars nearby provide fun nights out without breaking the bank. One of the bars recently got a name change and became more pricey, but the service and drinks aren’t too bad. The majority of people here are either college students or lower-income residents, which is reflected in the affordable housing. There's an elementary school within walking distance, adding to the neighborhood's lively atmosphere. My neighbors and I don’t interact much, but they don’t bother me. The building management even placed an air freshener near their door to combat the frequent marijuana smoke, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings in my area are mostly old, but some have been spruced up from the inside. Down the road, new apartment buildings have popped up, but their construction quality is questionable despite the high rent, all thanks to their prime campus location. There’s a cheap eatery nearby that serves food on paper plates and mostly microwaves its offerings. Across from it is a gas station, known for poor work conditions, but the city improved the street and sidewalks last year, making the area more pleasant. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street but 43rd street behind it isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are in poor condition, and the buildings look shabby. Many trees line this street, possibly to conceal the buildings' appearance. While crime happens at the apartments on 43rdstreet, I can’t single them out as the sole culprits. There are also problematic apartments across from mine with a transient population. Despite the challenges, I like where I live; it's affordable, and there are convenient amenities nearby, especially the university and bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a cul-de-sac lined with duplexes that look like standalone homes, each painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most neighbors are friends, and we often gather at the end of the street to chat while kids play. It's like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees, and blue skies with white clouds. This year, we're experiencing tornado warnings, and last night, we heard sirens. I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my little dog and a few pillows, while my bigger dog barked from the living room. The storm left the road steaming as the temperature dropped from 92 to 75. Hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. After the storm, a double rainbow appeared, and I snapped some photos to share with my friends and family. The neighborhood was quiet for an hour before people started returning home. Business as usual resumed, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. I love the southern accent here; it's a gem of a place to live, forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by rooster crows, and we have a donkey braying in the evening. I was fortunate to find this cozy community.",
            "I moved here right before starting eighth grade. Making friends was tough at first, but I eventually hit it off with a buddy who lived two doors down and another guy on my street. They've since moved away, but the memories linger. The folks who've been here since I moved are still around, for the most part. Our neighborhood's pretty standard for suburban America, filled with two-story homes. Weekends and warm days bring kids playing outside, and it's usually quiet the rest of the time. I've never had issues with my neighbors, and I'd say I can trust them. A park a few minutes from my house holds many memories - basketball, football, baseball games, and even my worst memory, a painful elbow to the nose during a game. Today, I go there to bond with my cousin's kids, who love the swings and slides. The park fills me with nostalgia. Our neighborhood's diverse, with a variety of cuisines within a mile - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. Nowadays, folks often use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered. We've got all the stores you need, from dry cleaners to pharmacies, a grocery store, and even an Indian-owned shop for some authentic cuisine. In comparison to other places I've read about, I consider myself fortunate for my neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is one of those small towns you might find scattered around South Carolina. It's nothing extraordinary, but it sure has a knack for peaches and farming, which is why Johnston is proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town's welcome sign proudly boasts this title, and it's not hard to understand why. Most of the land around here is covered in peach orchards or cattle fields. Houses are spaced out, often two stories with either metal roofs to keep the summer sun at bay or gray shingles. They're usually not positioned near the road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the main part of town, there's a solitary traffic light at a four-way intersection, and that's where you'll find all the stores! There's a quaint little Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, a Fiesta Mexican spot, Gary's burger joint (which has a limited menu but is quite popular), and Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small pharmacy famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. You'll also find a small, upscale grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, and a Dollar General store that's bustling from morning till night. There's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a kind woman who's well-respected in the community, and attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that offers daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. The town has a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, and students have to travel to the next town for middle and high school. There are no parks yet, but they're planning a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide more opportunities for families and attract visitors. Despite the lack of large stores, restaurants, or parks, it's a tight-knit community that makes you feel like you're part of something special!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. I was taken aback, seeing that almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Maybe it's because of the struggle we're all facing. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, given how expensive things are. But we've become frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell less in adulthood. You might pick up a cigarette or just get used to the way things are. But the flea market always has its place. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano, wedging itself into the leather and lingering even after you wash it. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting on the far side, you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but you wouldn't hear that in the thrifts. No matter the crowd, the stores are eerily silent. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Each year, the city swells with more and more people. It's a developing city, they say, with one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and you can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned means you care deeply. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can maintain your privacy for as long as you like, and the city will just flow around you like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn together, and help each other out when we can. I'm lucky to be here. I get along well with most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty well too. I make sure to clean after myself and leave them food, and they do the same. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The area where I reside is a quintessential cookie-cutter suburb, with a homeowner's association that's evident right away. Upon entering, you'll see a uniform grid of well-maintained single-family homes, thanks to the HOA. The front yards are all similar, with small patches of landscaped grass, a smattering of decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you might spot a small tree. Every household boasts a two-car garage. As you drive along the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete streets without any potholes, ensuring a smooth drive. Most homes are single-story, but every now and then, you'll find a two-story. Mailboxes are communal, with a large grouping at the end of the street, each requiring a key for access. There are also two larger lockers for packages, a system that keeps the community uniform, thanks to the HOA. My house is located on the outskirts of a nearby city, offering a blend of rural and suburban living with ample space. There are multiple community pools and walking trails for dog walks or leisurely strolls. The community is large enough that running around it provides plenty of exercise. The neighborhood is primarily retirement homes but also has a scattering of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is large in population but retains a small-town feel. We've got all the amenities you'd expect, such as one mall, no enormous but functional, with stores ranging from high-end grocery outlets to bargain outlets with limited staff. Everything is within a 15-minute drive, making it easy to get to major chains. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, with nice things like pools and walking trails, and while it's not right next to shopping, a car ride away will get you to any major chain you need.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town, practically on the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side, is the most economically underprivileged area. Most houses are rented by or owned by low-income individuals, but it's not unpleasant to live here. Neighbors here are generally friendly and wave hello as I walk down the street. Crime rates are a bit higher, with a few violent incidents, including shootings and one homicide, within a few blocks of my home over the past decade. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Our family has had no direct involvement with crime apart from a few missing items from our porch. The town has been heavily impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Despite this, there are numerous resources to combat the epidemic, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions. My son's elementary school is excellent, with wonderful staff and no bullying due to his special needs. The PTO plans family events to enhance involvement and educational progress. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The City Council has improved the town's appearance, with road repaving, landscaping, and park refurbishing, mostly in the center and on the west side. The east side, where I live, is often neglected. Overall, I enjoy living here with friendly people, great schools, adequate shopping, and a comfortable home. We've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hub, nestled on a hill and surrounded by historical buildings. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old live theater, and just a block down is a cool little arcade bar that attracts all sorts of people on warm summer nights, often forming a line of eager patrons. A few blocks up, there's a spacious city park with concrete walls and tall steps. During winter, homeless people set up their tents along the sidewalks and steps for warmth. It doesn't snow much, but the rain can be intense, making it challenging to stay warm. They're close to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the iconic buildings; it's the people and their culture. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, but the residents work hard to keep it clean, and the stories of those days are still passed down. It might be considered one of the rougher 'hoods,' but the people care about their city and block. The warning not to walk around Hilltop after dark, often given to white people, is a reminder of the past and social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have offered me a jacket more times than tried to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners stayed open late so I could charge my phone, and where I've sat, feeling invisible, only to be acknowledged and given $5 by a stranger who told me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call rural Michigan my home, nestled between farmlands and charming tourist towns. There's no big city shopping, no Walmart or Target, not even an Applebee's. Everywhere you need to go, you drive. But I'm lucky to live in one of Mother Nature's most breathtaking spots, with Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix on my doorstep. Anywhere you go, there's a beach waiting. My neighborhood is classic small-town America. Houses aren't stacked, they're unique, with basements visible from the road. You'll find aluminum-siding homes of every color, with yards full of trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for furry friends. These are homes of hardworking folks who've raised or are raising families. Kids are always out running around, neighbors wave and walk their dogs, bikes, and rollerblades, while lawns are kept neat and tidy. It's not a fancy neighborhood, but a peaceful, safe one perfect for raising a family. The county sheriff's department and jail are nearby, along with the health department, recycling center, and sports fields. You can hear planes taking off and landing at our small airport. Ice cream is a short walk away, and downtown is just a bike ride. It's a great place to live, a place you can tell is perfect for a family."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a bustling big city, with a neighborhood that's as diverse as it gets. Residential areas are scattered among commercial districts, where you'll find all sorts of businesses - offices, stores, eateries, and entertainment spots. There's no shortage of places to eat or shop, ranging from giant corporate stores to cozy boutiques that line up along the streets, often within walking distance from peaceful neighborhoods. We've got a couple of nearby parks too, always filled with families and their young ones. The people here are a mix of folks - there's a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish group, and refugees/immigrants from the Soviet Union right in my neighborhood. Just a bit further out, you'll find enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, all within a few miles' radius. But don't let that fool you - a 10-mile drive can easily take an hour or two due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours. Few people walk around here; the city's so large that people prefer to commute by car. This means traffic's a nightmare, and parking's nearly impossible. Despite all this, there's been a lot of construction lately, with new apartment buildings popping up like mushrooms. While it's a popular destination, residents aren't thrilled about the prospect of more people and cars. We have all sorts of houses too - single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings. People of all ages live here, and I barely know most of my neighbors. It's not the tight-knit community it used to be when I was a kid, where I'd play outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends close to my age.",
            "My neighborhood is quite unique. Most of the houses here are single-family homes, but a few have been divided into two units, still attached to each other. My home has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. Like many others, our neighborhood is a reminder of the time when life in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once seemed to unify the people, but now it feels like it's slipping away. My neighborhood, along with many others, still clings to this dream, attracting visitors who feel it's still alive. Though the optimism of the past seems to have faded, and the upkeep of the yards has slackened, there's still a car in every driveway and kids playing as if the world revolves around them. The public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth and stir up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Each home has its own character, yet they all feel the same. There's a massive supermarket called \"Super A\" owned by a large Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are spacious, and kids play football, pausing only for passing cars. Most residents have been here for generations, and many can spin tales of a past where everyone knew everyone. A karate school once operated here, but with the waning popularity of karate kid movies, it closed. Now it's a pharmacy, as many believe drugs can solve all problems. There's also a small movie theater that plays old films at discounted prices, attracting the elderly who enjoy a night out without the kids. A single expressway runs through our town, with the entrance and exit in the neighboring town. There was a petition to bring the exit to our town, but the elders opposed it, fearing it would ruin our community. They convinced the city council to reject the request. A new high school is being built, and we're debating a mascot. I suggest a cybernetic cowboy with a log cabin.",
            "You might walk right past it without a second glance - after all, it's just a residential area behind a shopping strip, not the kind of place most people would think to look for a place to live. Behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels only occupied occasionally for family reunions, there's a whole bustling community. Amidst these communities, down the road, there are a few apartment complexes nestled together like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully pulled apart and lined up. The first apartments you come across are those that have been featured in the news for some unsavory activities, so we won't dwell on those too much. But the apartments next to that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole different story, almost unknown to anyone living in the area. Across from these complexes stands a community college's satellite campus, a quiet, sleepy set of buildings where students saunter in with coffee in hand at 7 in the morning to start their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters honk and groan at the traffic delays on days with higher attendance. The road intersects another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those who've broken bones on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that whirls the warm, thick summer air. Children play cartwheels and pirouettes across the prickly grass in the park, while bees lazily buzz around the flower patches. Elderly folks stroll their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding at the girls gathered by the playground equipment, discussing boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park with inexpensive yet not too busy food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon in between. You can fill your pool while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken - the perks of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt place where teens often cling to cold, sweating cups of DIY frozen yogurt covered in toppings while doing tricks on their skateboards and vaping because they think it's cool. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where not much ever changes, not even time.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked, driving past the corn fields that stretched out before us. “This is it!” I replied, knowing she’d be taken aback by the vast openness. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a 5-minute walk from her house - she'd never seen this much space. The corn fields were a sight to behold, and I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio. As we drove along the two-lane country road, we passed a quarry filled with water, and just beyond that, the small development where I lived. The houses here were mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land, which everyone took pride in maintaining. During spring, these driveways would be lined with the finest Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, gleaming after a thorough wash. Continuing towards my grey stucco home, I’d always see my Korean neighbor out, with a friendly face, spending the day tending to his lawn. He’d be singing over the hum of his mower, and everyone in the neighborhood would laugh, but he was always genuine and had an intriguing history. Once a doctor, he now spends his days blending in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nReaching my home, we found a side yard filled with geese being chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream fed into the quarry, where you could hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge, there was an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent my childhood, building tree forts and “hunting” animals, which usually just meant chasing them. The winters here could be brutally cold, transforming the yard into a barren wilderness. Bare trees, once adorned with vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers, would turn into skeletal structures. Snowball fights were our favorite winter activity, with my sister and me building igloo-like forts to house our arsenal. In our winter wonderland, we’d play pretend, carefree and happy, without a worry in the world.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a place that's all about embracing the strange. The unofficial town motto, as proudly displayed on a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club (all while skirting the law on a few of these), is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some people see it as a nod to Portland's creative and unique culture from the 90's and early 2000's, a time when the city was still relatively unknown and cheaper. For others, it's an invitation to join in the weirdness, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of apartment complexes to house them, Portland still holds onto its weirdness. Weird doesn't mean being open to everything, but it does mean being open to things that are unusual. Weird doesn't mean we're without modern conveniences or modern problems. We buy most of our stuff from China, just like the rest of the country. Portland has a million ways to be weird, to be not normal, but it also has plenty of normalcy. There's yoga and hipsters and business professionals galore. Maybe weird means we just don't take everything so seriously. In my neighborhood, like many in Portland, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes are traditionally old cardboard boxes with items someone is giving away, but they can be plastic bags or boxes too. They contain magical treasures just waiting for the person who wanders by. They often have clothes and books, but they can have anything. Wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about for me, but I'm just one variety of weird among countless others. Some people I live with would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga or support the city's soccer team, the Timbers. Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things and are full of dreams. Yes, Portland has a drug problem, which is often rooted in mental health issues. The constant rainy weather and dreary clouds don't help matters. Portland also has a homelessness problem, which no one seems to know how to tackle. Social services are better here than in many places, but they're still lacking. The homeless population is drawn by Portland's services, but our efforts are insufficient, just like everywhere else. The non-homeless population swings between concern and hatred. In this, we're not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there, standing tall and steadfast in the north. They bear witness to the sun's daily rise and fall, and no matter how busy life and work become, they remain unchanging and unperturbed. On days when I feel most stressed and overwhelmed, they call to me, and when I turn to them, they offer a place of solace and strength to carry on, one day at a time. I first encountered these mountains when I moved here for undergrad, and they were instantly captivating. While the university and town have their own charms, it's the mountains that truly capture my heart. The town itself is beautiful with its own unique blend of old and new. There are countless cafes where many hours were spent with books and friends, and the downtown area offers a vibrant atmosphere with its historic brick buildings and bustling restaurants. This urban energy gives way to a quieter, more serene small-town feel just a short walk away, with the library serving as a dividing line between the two. This contrast of environments makes the city feel inviting, like a puzzle just waiting to be explored. Memories are made in each part of town, from late-night walks in the park with friends to catching a movie in the fancy theater provided by the university. However, it's not all sunshine and roses. The town is also home to many tough memories, and the ponds can serve as a place for reflection and even crying sessions, especially during existential crises. Watching the turtles and ducks go about their days has often left me questioning my own purpose in life. But after a while, I'd walk past the pond, park, and the familiar houses, until I reached a main street. There, the sun would cast its golden rays upon the palm trees, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they stood, as they always had, the mountains reaching up to the sky, their presence a beacon of unyielding strength. They spoke to me of perseverance, reminding me to carry on, one step at a time.",
            "If you're thinking of visiting Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it! Public transit is readily available and a favorite among New Yorkers. Bensonhurt is pretty urban, so you'll feel right at home in the city. While you're there, expect to see plenty of Asian stores. Over the past 20 years, Bensonhurt has become a hotspot for Asians, with Asian-owned businesses everywhere. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common, and they're beloved by locals for their quality products and lower prices. I live nearby and can vouch for the convenience—there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other! But Bensonhurt isn't just Asian; it's very diverse, with immigrants, first-gen, and second-gen residents. Most major businesses are owned by Asians, and there's even a recently renovated park nearby with basketball and soccer fields, handball courts, swings, a kid-friendly playground, and a water fountain. New York's parks are diverse, and Bensonhurt is no exception. Most folks are nice, but it can get pretty noisy. Cars are often blaring music, and early morning gas revving can wake you up. After dark, stay alert; while Bensonhurt is generally safe, it can be unpredictable. I've had past experiences with bullying and package theft, but these incidents are rare. Dog waste is a common issue; you'll see plenty on your way to the train or supermarket. Keep your shoes clean, folks!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks around here. My house sits right at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, earning it the moniker \"work out hill\" for all the joggers who hit it daily. Since sidewalks are non-existent, everyone walks on the road. The road's in pretty bad shape, with a few potholes that make driving a bit of a challenge. The telephone and electric wires are a mess too, constantly being repaired due to the frequent storms and fallen branches, making them look like a patchwork quilt. Evergreen trees dot the landscape, but locals aren't fond of them, cutting down as many as possible to clear the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill to take in the view of the bay, with large glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets here are stunning, with the water lighting up and the sky turning orange. But most days are cloudy and damp, with moss covering roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month and had to spend three hours scraping off the moss. Kids are few and far between, but there's a school nearby. Most people are older, retired, with dogs being the common \"children\" in the neighborhood. Leave a door or window open, and you might find a dog in your living room. Rabbits run wild around the area, digging up gardens and lawns, much to the gardeners' dismay. My cats love them though, keeping most of them away. We get the usual birds too, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle chased off by neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but a hike downhill to the waterfront has a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. There's not much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shoreline even through the mist on most days.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many folks move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live here. Everyone keeps themselves busy with yard work and other daily chores. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we take note of it. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you'd expect from a quiet neighborhood. We're home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, myself, my wife, and two daughters aged eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Every now and then we grill outside on our back deck, and the smell of barbecue is always pleasant. It seems like there's always someone cutting grass around here, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through October when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's plenty of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the fall as well. That means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I love the smell of burning leaves, so it's always a nice sign that fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks on it, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town, and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. The same goes for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where dirt is as far as the eye can see. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the feeling of always seeing brown. When you do see a lawn, it means someone's dropping a fortune on lawn care. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide, but now it's the same story with new additions popping up. The place looks more like a city every day, but I guess that's how most places change. Most of the time, people are friendly, but like any city, there are good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so I suppose it's a nice part of town. The stores here are mostly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale shopping, you've got to travel. I've never seen a Whole Foods or any store like that here. The jobs that stand out the most are in construction, probably because this city is still developing, with plenty of open spaces to build on. That makes me a little nervous, as I like things just the way they are now. I came from a big city and there's no way I'm going back. Speaking of construction, that's what I do for a living. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about my home is the variety of animals. People come here for the stark beauty of the desert, and the unique ecosystems created by the climate and topology. We've managed to coexist with the wildlife well. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. As for attractions, we have some, and Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. If you're lucky, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood for snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's got geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the area's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm guessing my answer is a bit unique. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their own personal lives, my situation's a tad different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus I call home, and the people living in my dormitory to be my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser degree. Despite this peculiarity, there are common threads with conventional neighborhood life. Just like any other neighborhood, mine has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by talking about the houses that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, it's crucial to clarify the types of housing you'll find. We have apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, you'll usually find 2-4 people in each room, with around 4-6 rooms per floor. A typical building can house about 20 people. Next, there are actual houses available for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. These are 2-4 bedroom setups, often occupied by alumni. However, there are only a few of these scattered throughout the neighborhood due to efficiency concerns. Lastly, there are dormitory-style rooms that house hundreds of students. Here, two people share a room, with a few exceptions. This is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school emphasizes diversity, and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. People from all cultures and ages call this place home. Professional staff typically live in houses within the neighborhood, while newer students live in dorm-style housing and older students in apartment-style housing. It's hard to do justice to the people in this neighborhood, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since the school is self-contained, it has a wealth of stores and a single park. You'll find a mix of dining options and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. Anything you need can be found within the neighborhood's boundaries! Plus, the park is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, kept clean and free of crime by its residents!",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only gone so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, which is why I enjoy living here. While there are mainly apartment buildings, a few restaurants and bars nearby provide fun nights out without breaking the bank. One of the bars recently got a name change and became more pricey, but the service and drinks aren’t too bad. The majority of people here are either college students or lower-income residents, which is reflected in the affordable housing. There's an elementary school within walking distance, adding to the neighborhood's lively atmosphere. My neighbors and I don’t interact much, but they don’t bother me. The building management even placed an air freshener near their door to combat the frequent marijuana smoke, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings in my area are mostly old, but some have been spruced up from the inside. Down the road, new apartment buildings have popped up, but their construction quality is questionable despite the high rent, all thanks to their prime campus location. There’s a cheap eatery nearby that serves food on paper plates and mostly microwaves its offerings. Across from it is a gas station, known for poor work conditions, but the city improved the street and sidewalks last year, making the area more pleasant. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street but 43rd street behind it isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are in poor condition, and the buildings look shabby. Many trees line this street, possibly to conceal the buildings' appearance. While crime happens at the apartments on 43rdstreet, I can’t single them out as the sole culprits. There are also problematic apartments across from mine with a transient population. Despite the challenges, I like where I live; it's affordable, and there are convenient amenities nearby, especially the university and bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a cul-de-sac lined with duplexes that look like standalone homes, each painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most neighbors are friends, and we often gather at the end of the street to chat while kids play. It's like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees, and blue skies with white clouds. This year, we're experiencing tornado warnings, and last night, we heard sirens. I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my little dog and a few pillows, while my bigger dog barked from the living room. The storm left the road steaming as the temperature dropped from 92 to 75. Hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. After the storm, a double rainbow appeared, and I snapped some photos to share with my friends and family. The neighborhood was quiet for an hour before people started returning home. Business as usual resumed, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. I love the southern accent here; it's a gem of a place to live, forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by rooster crows, and we have a donkey braying in the evening. I was fortunate to find this cozy community.",
            "I moved here right before starting eighth grade. Making friends was tough at first, but I eventually hit it off with a buddy who lived two doors down and another guy on my street. They've since moved away, but the memories linger. The folks who've been here since I moved are still around, for the most part. Our neighborhood's pretty standard for suburban America, filled with two-story homes. Weekends and warm days bring kids playing outside, and it's usually quiet the rest of the time. I've never had issues with my neighbors, and I'd say I can trust them. A park a few minutes from my house holds many memories - basketball, football, baseball games, and even my worst memory, a painful elbow to the nose during a game. Today, I go there to bond with my cousin's kids, who love the swings and slides. The park fills me with nostalgia. Our neighborhood's diverse, with a variety of cuisines within a mile - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. Nowadays, folks often use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered. We've got all the stores you need, from dry cleaners to pharmacies, a grocery store, and even an Indian-owned shop for some authentic cuisine. In comparison to other places I've read about, I consider myself fortunate for my neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is one of those small towns you might find scattered around South Carolina. It's nothing extraordinary, but it sure has a knack for peaches and farming, which is why Johnston is proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town's welcome sign proudly boasts this title, and it's not hard to understand why. Most of the land around here is covered in peach orchards or cattle fields. Houses are spaced out, often two stories with either metal roofs to keep the summer sun at bay or gray shingles. They're usually not positioned near the road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the main part of town, there's a solitary traffic light at a four-way intersection, and that's where you'll find all the stores! There's a quaint little Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, a Fiesta Mexican spot, Gary's burger joint (which has a limited menu but is quite popular), and Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small pharmacy famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. You'll also find a small, upscale grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, and a Dollar General store that's bustling from morning till night. There's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a kind woman who's well-respected in the community, and attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that offers daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. The town has a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, and students have to travel to the next town for middle and high school. There are no parks yet, but they're planning a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide more opportunities for families and attract visitors. Despite the lack of large stores, restaurants, or parks, it's a tight-knit community that makes you feel like you're part of something special!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. I was taken aback, seeing that almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Maybe it's because of the struggle we're all facing. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night, given how expensive things are. But we've become frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell less in adulthood. You might pick up a cigarette or just get used to the way things are. But the flea market always has its place. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano, wedging itself into the leather and lingering even after you wash it. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting on the far side, you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but you wouldn't hear that in the thrifts. No matter the crowd, the stores are eerily silent. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Each year, the city swells with more and more people. It's a developing city, they say, with one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and you can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned means you care deeply. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can maintain your privacy for as long as you like, and the city will just flow around you like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn together, and help each other out when we can. I'm lucky to be here. I get along well with most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty well too. I make sure to clean after myself and leave them food, and they do the same. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The area where I reside is a quintessential cookie-cutter suburb, with a homeowner's association that's evident right away. Upon entering, you'll see a uniform grid of well-maintained single-family homes, thanks to the HOA. The front yards are all similar, with small patches of landscaped grass, a smattering of decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you might spot a small tree. Every household boasts a two-car garage. As you drive along the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete streets without any potholes, ensuring a smooth drive. Most homes are single-story, but every now and then, you'll find a two-story. Mailboxes are communal, with a large grouping at the end of the street, each requiring a key for access. There are also two larger lockers for packages, a system that keeps the community uniform, thanks to the HOA. My house is located on the outskirts of a nearby city, offering a blend of rural and suburban living with ample space. There are multiple community pools and walking trails for dog walks or leisurely strolls. The community is large enough that running around it provides plenty of exercise. The neighborhood is primarily retirement homes but also has a scattering of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is large in population but retains a small-town feel. We've got all the amenities you'd expect, such as one mall, no enormous but functional, with stores ranging from high-end grocery outlets to bargain outlets with limited staff. Everything is within a 15-minute drive, making it easy to get to major chains. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, with nice things like pools and walking trails, and while it's not right next to shopping, a car ride away will get you to any major chain you need.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town, practically on the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side, is the most economically underprivileged area. Most houses are rented by or owned by low-income individuals, but it's not unpleasant to live here. Neighbors here are generally friendly and wave hello as I walk down the street. Crime rates are a bit higher, with a few violent incidents, including shootings and one homicide, within a few blocks of my home over the past decade. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Our family has had no direct involvement with crime apart from a few missing items from our porch. The town has been heavily impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Despite this, there are numerous resources to combat the epidemic, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions. My son's elementary school is excellent, with wonderful staff and no bullying due to his special needs. The PTO plans family events to enhance involvement and educational progress. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The City Council has improved the town's appearance, with road repaving, landscaping, and park refurbishing, mostly in the center and on the west side. The east side, where I live, is often neglected. Overall, I enjoy living here with friendly people, great schools, adequate shopping, and a comfortable home. We've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hub, nestled on a hill and surrounded by historical buildings. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old live theater, and just a block down is a cool little arcade bar that attracts all sorts of people on warm summer nights, often forming a line of eager patrons. A few blocks up, there's a spacious city park with concrete walls and tall steps. During winter, homeless people set up their tents along the sidewalks and steps for warmth. It doesn't snow much, but the rain can be intense, making it challenging to stay warm. They're close to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the iconic buildings; it's the people and their culture. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, but the residents work hard to keep it clean, and the stories of those days are still passed down. It might be considered one of the rougher 'hoods,' but the people care about their city and block. The warning not to walk around Hilltop after dark, often given to white people, is a reminder of the past and social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have offered me a jacket more times than tried to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners stayed open late so I could charge my phone, and where I've sat, feeling invisible, only to be acknowledged and given $5 by a stranger who told me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call rural Michigan my home, nestled between farmlands and charming tourist towns. There's no big city shopping, no Walmart or Target, not even an Applebee's. Everywhere you need to go, you drive. But I'm lucky to live in one of Mother Nature's most breathtaking spots, with Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix on my doorstep. Anywhere you go, there's a beach waiting. My neighborhood is classic small-town America. Houses aren't stacked, they're unique, with basements visible from the road. You'll find aluminum-siding homes of every color, with yards full of trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for furry friends. These are homes of hardworking folks who've raised or are raising families. Kids are always out running around, neighbors wave and walk their dogs, bikes, and rollerblades, while lawns are kept neat and tidy. It's not a fancy neighborhood, but a peaceful, safe one perfect for raising a family. The county sheriff's department and jail are nearby, along with the health department, recycling center, and sports fields. You can hear planes taking off and landing at our small airport. Ice cream is a short walk away, and downtown is just a bike ride. It's a great place to live, a place you can tell is perfect for a family."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a big city, my neighborhood is a melting pot of diversity. Residential areas pepper commercial ones, with a mix of offices, stores, and entertainment spots. There’s no shortage of places to dine or shop, from big-name brands to quaint boutiques lining the streets. Some homes are large, corporate-owned structures, while others are cozy, family-owned places. There are even a couple of nearby parks where people take their kids. The folks around here are varied too - a significant LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish families, and a group of former Soviet Union refugees live together. Just a short drive away, there’s Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia. But don't let the short distance fool you; even 10 miles can take hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Parking’s a nightmare, and finding a spot anywhere is a challenge. Despite all the growth - apartments and condos sprouting up left and right - many residents dread the thought of more people and vehicles clogging the roads. Housing options are diverse, with single-family homes and duplexes scattered throughout. I barely know my neighbors, although I have fond childhood memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few friends from the 'hood.",
            "My hood is something else. Most of the houses are single-family, but there are a few split into two units, still attached, ya feel me? My place has a wee yard in front and a lil driveway to the left. It's like a blast from the past, a symbol of the American dream, which once enticed folks but has since taken a backseat. Yet, my hood and others like it still stand tall, still whisper that dream's alive. Folks ain't as hopeful as they used to be, the upkeep of the yards ain't what it was, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the kids still play like they own the world. The public school, standing for almost a century, seems to stir up a future in the youth and a nostalgic past in the elders. The churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always full. Every house is unique, yet they all feel the same. There's this big supermarket called Super A, run by a Yemeni family, probably the only Arabs in the hood. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids play football, pausing only for cars to pass. Most folks have been here for generations, and most can tell tales of a time when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate movies, the kids lost interest, so they turned it into a pharmacy. There's a little movie theater playing old flicks at a discount, avoided by the youth but favored by the elders. We got an expressway that runs through our town, but the exit's in the town next door. There was a petition to get an exit here, but the youth supported it while the elders rejected it, convincing the city council to deny it. They say having an exit would ruin the town, so said the elders. They're building a new high school, and we're trying to decide on a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of our town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it's behind a shopping strip and the hotels are only occupied annually, so it doesn't seem like the kind of place you'd expect to find a thriving community. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels, you'll discover a whole neighborhood you never knew existed. The first apartment complexes you'll come across have made headlines for their unsavory dealings, but there are others, hidden in plain sight, that are quite different. Across the street is a community college's satellite campus, where students and commuters pass each other, and there's a residential street with a park and a rehabilitation center. Children play in the grass, retired folks walk their dogs, and teens gather at the playground. There's even a strip mall with a sushi place, a nail salon, and a frozen yogurt shop. It's like a little bit of Americana, a piece of the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "“Where’s everything?” she asked as we drove past the cornfields stretching out as far as the eye can see. “This is it!” I declared, knowing she’d be overwhelmed by the vast open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a 5-minute walk from her home—she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Stunned by the sea of corn, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you’ll find a quarry filled with water. Just past it is the small development where I live. The houses are mostly made of brick and stucco, with each one boasting at least a half-acre of land that everyone takes great pride in maintaining. During springtime, annual flowers and Midwestern trees paint the landscape with vibrant colors. The driveways are filled with gleaming Mercedes Benz luxury cars, freshly washed. As we continued along the road toward my gray stucco house, my Korean neighbor was always outside with a warm smile. He spent most of his day mowing his lawn and could be heard singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him entertaining, and he’s a genuine and unique individual with a fascinating past. Once a doctor, he blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you’ll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here, I spent most of my childhood. We built tree forts, chased animals, and found friends in the neighborhood. The winters in our small town can be brutal, transforming the landscape into a winter wonderland. The yard turns into a sea of green, with trees losing their leaves and turning into barren skeletons. After a snowfall, snow angels and snowmen appear, and my sister and I fought with our weapon of choice—snowballs. We’d build enormous igloo-like forts to house our snowball arsenal, and in our own little wonderland, we played pretend, free from care.",
            "First things first, Portland, Oregon, is like no other place. The unofficial motto, \"Keep Portland Weird,\" can be found on a building that doubles as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and even a strip club, all while sometimes bending the law. Some folks see it as a reminder of Portland's past, a time when it was less known and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's an invitation to embrace the weird—welcome to Portland, where being weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant condo construction for them, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't just about acceptance but also about normalcy and modern life. Like everywhere else, Portland buys stuff from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be not normal, but Portland has a fair share of the usual too—yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe weird means we just don't take all this too seriously. In my neighborhood, like in many Portland neighborhoods, you'll see colorful homes with gardens full of flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets. Free boxes are a summer staple—a magical treasure trove awaiting the lucky passerby, often filled with clothes, books, or other interesting items. The magical potential in walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That's what Portland is all about to me, but I'm just one type of weird among many. Some people I live among wouldn't dream of picking their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga or support the Timbers (the city's soccer team). Portland has a variety of passions. Portland has a drug problem, a reflection of mental health issues, and the constant rain and dreary skies may not help. Portland also has a homelessness problem, one that's difficult to tackle, much like in other places. The non-homeless population is split between care and hatred. Here, Portland is just like everywhere else.",
            "The peaks of the mountains stand tall, always present, greeting the sunrise and sunset. They are constant, unchanging, and untouched by life's troubles. On days when life gets tough, they become a beacon, calling out to me. I first noticed them when I moved here for my undergrad, and they've been a source of strength ever since. The campus is beautiful, with stunning buildings, ponds, and trees that occupy a piece of my heart, but the mountains are the true kings. The town is a mix of old and new. There are bustling cafes, a vibrant downtown area with historic buildings, and a quiet suburban feel. It's a blend of calm and energy, inviting you to explore. The memories here are plenty, from midnight walks in the park to rushing through town to catch a movie. There are also tough memories, like those late-night reflections by the pond, questioning life's purpose. But there are always the mountains, offering a calm perspective. One morning, I walked the main street, past the palm trees and into the sunrise. As I looked up at the sky, I realized I was heading north. The mountains stood strong, painting the horizon with their presence, and I found my resolve in their steadfastness.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you shouldn't have any trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and a popular mode of transport in New York City. Bensonhurt is a dense, urban place, so you'll feel right at home in NYC. While in the neighborhood, prepare to see numerous Asian stores. Over the past 20 years, Bensonhurt has seen a surge in Asian residents, making it common to find an Asian-owned store every few blocks. Grocery stores and laundromats are particularly prevalent and popular among locals. They offer quality food at lower prices and are very convenient. Just a short walk from my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other. This convenience is just one of the many perks of living in this neighborhood. While Bensonhurt has a significant Asian population, it's quite diverse with immigrants and their children living there, and many popular businesses are Asian-owned. In addition to these stores, there's a newly renovated park nearby with several sports courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, and facilities for kids. It's a diverse and inclusive park where people of all backgrounds can enjoy the space. There aren't many large corporate buildings, mainly co-op and condo apartments. Most residents live in two-family homes. The locals are generally friendly, but the neighborhood can be quite noisy. Every day, you'll hear cars blasting music as they drive by, and the sound of accelerating cars can wake you up in the morning. At night, it's important to be cautious. The neighborhood is safe, but unpredictable. You might encounter people looking for trouble, bullies, or thieves. I've been bullied here in the past, but that was years ago. Recently, I had my package stolen. While it's a common issue, it does happen. Dog waste is also a problem. New York City fines people for not cleaning up after their dogs, but these rules aren't followed here. Every morning, you'll see dog waste on your way to the train station or the supermarket. It's everywhere, and it's a pet peeve of mine. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Not many sidewalks can be found where I live. Everything seems to slope downwards, with my house situated at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. Locals refer to it as the \"work out hill,\" as many joggers enjoy running up it daily. The entire street lacks sidewalks, so everyone walks on the road, which has a few potholes making it a bit treacherous to drive on. Telephone and electric wires crisscross the area at various heights, often looking worn and patchy due to frequent storms that bring branches and debris down, causing constant repairs. Evergreen trees surround the neighborhood, but residents dislike them, as they block the view of the ocean. Many homes are built high up the hill, with expansive second stories taking advantage of the view. The area is stunning at sunset when the water appears to glow from below and the sky turns orange, though it's often cloudy. Most days are overcast and damp, with moss growing on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it had become furry with moss. It took hours to clean off. Few children live nearby, but there's a school a few blocks away. Most residents are older, with many retired, and dogs are common instead. Seeing them in people's lawns or racing down the street is routine, and they often sneak into homes if left open. Rabbits also run wild, digging up roots and burrowing into yards, but my cats have managed to hunt most of them out. The usual bird varieties, from small sparrows to hummingbirds, and occasional hawks or eagles, can be seen. There aren't any stores nearby, but hiking downhill to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The bay isn't very wide, and the opposite shore is visible through the mist on most days.",
            "In a typical southern town in Tennessee, I reside on a through street that links two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd prefer. Other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood where the locals are familiar with one another. Most folks keep busy with their yard work and daily chores. During winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. Living at the front corner of our street, we're well acquainted with the comings and goings all day long. Whenever we spot an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Neighbors stroll for exercise or walk their dogs, and kids ride their bikes. Since we work from home, you'll often find us outdoors or in the garage. I have a family of four: myself, my wife, and our daughters aged eleven and fourteen. With us living here, everyone knows we're always popping in and out. We enjoy grilling on our back deck, and the barbecue aroma is always pleasant. From March through October, lawn mowers hum nearly every day as the grass grows. Our neighborhood has a lot of trees, which provide shade but also require leaf raking and burning come Fall. The smell of burning leaves signals Fall's arrival, and we've had quite a long one this year.\n\nOn holidays, the neighborhood is quiet, except for Thanksgiving when families visit and extra cars fill the streets. Mother's Day and Christmas are similar. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street aspect, it would be ideal.",
            "The high desert is a world of endless dirt, dirt, and more dirt, with the occasional green lawn standing out as a sign of substantial lawn care efforts. When I first moved here in the 90s, the houses were scattered, but now it's a mixed bag with new additions, giving it a city-like feel. While most people are friendly, every place has its good neighborhoods and bad. My neighborhood is filled with friendly old folks, and the stores are largely chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale, you'll have to travel. Construction is the dominant job here—it's a city still finding its way, and there's plenty of open space for development. My job fits this well; I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. The desert is beautiful, and its unique climate and landscape have created challenging habitats for various desert creatures. My kids love exploring and catching lizards and desert bugs, and visitors can enjoy the annual San Bernardino County Fair and nearby Wrightwood's snow-covered mountains. For nature lovers, the Victor Valley Museum offers geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items telling the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my answer is a bit unique. Unlike the typical homeowner, I live on a college campus, where the dormitory is my community, and the campus itself is my larger neighborhood. While it may be unconventional, my neighborhood shares common elements with more traditional ones. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses.\" Before I enumerate them, let's clarify the types of housing I have in my neighborhood. There are three: apartments, regular houses, and dormitory-style housing. Apartments usually have 2-4 people per room and about 4-6 rooms per floor. Most buildings house around 20 people. Regular houses are 2-4-bedroom rentals for school affiliates, though there are fewer of these. Dorm rooms are the most common, with 100's of students sharing, except for a couple sharing. Moving on to the people, our campus is diverse, with staff living in houses and students in dorms and apartments, from various cultures and ages. Now, onto the stores and parks. Our campus has various dining options and unique school-branded stores. Anything you need can be found here. Plus, our park is a playground for everyone, kept clean and safe by the neighborhood!",
            "Considering I've been here for around 10 years, I reckon I can share a thing or two. First off, I was pretty disheartened when I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was upset but my folks and I wanted a better life, a better school, and a less 'ghetto' neighborhood. It took time to adjust, but I made friends and even some... not-so-friends in school. The ones that stood out were Mr. Glen and his children, plus Dennis next door. They're like family, and I'm grateful to have them around. I recall when we attended Mr. Glen's remarrying ceremony. It was awesome, and I caught the bouquet, but missed the flowers! We danced till the morning, and though I haven't seen Marsharii since, I hope she's well. This neighborhood's like a big maze, but now I use a GPS to explore. I've only ventured so far, like when I hung out with Kason and Curtis, playing video games or relaxing in the park. I enjoy practicing my balance with some sticks from Home Depot and bringing my bokken sword if I can. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played much lately. My dad taught me tennis with Mr. Graves, and we'd have a blast. It's been a great place, and I look forward to more good times.",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, which is why I enjoy living here. Primarily, it's apartment buildings, but there are a few restaurants and bars that are fun and affordable. One bar was just renamed and is a bit pricier, yet the service and drinks aren't bad. Most people are friendly; they're either college students or of lower income, due to the affordable apartment housing. There's an elementary school nearby, which means there are a lot of kids around. I don’t know my neighbors well, but I don’t mind that much. They smoke a lot of weed, but the management responded by installing an air freshener unit by their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing, almost insulting. The buildings around me are older but might have updated interiors. Down the road, there are newer apartments, but I don’t like them because the construction seems subpar, yet the rent is expensive. The city helped improve the road last year, adding a nice sidewalk and plenty of grass along the medians and sides, making the area nicer. However, my apartment building is surrounded by trees, and while they cut down a few, there are still more trees than down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street behind me isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape and the buildings look run-down, with plenty of trees to hide the neglect. There's a lot of crime at an apartment complex on this street, but I can’t blame just them, as the ones across from me also have problems and a transient population. But overall, I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, especially the university's proximity and the two bus stops that make getting around easy.",
            "My neighborhood is a bunch of duplexes scattered up a dead-end street, giving them the appearance of individual homes. Each one's yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, but there's no consistency in how they're spaced or arranged. Most of us are buddies, but not all. After work, we gather at the end of the driveway, chatting away while the kids play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change from the tech-filled world we live in, like stepping back in time. We're tucked away among fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds above. The only downside? This year, we've been getting tornado warnings, and last night, we heard the sirens so we had to find shelter. I ended up in my bathtub with my little dog, a purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, save for the sound of hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly when it hit the pavement, and as I looked up, the sun came out and a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera and snapped some photos to share with my Facebook friends and family, who were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started returning home. Then it was business as usual, with moms and kids out as dinner was cooking. It's a friendly neighborhood for this gal who just moved from NH to NC. Everyone lives in a two bedroom, two bath apartment, but the insides vary in size. Some are quite small, which doesn't make sense to me. I love walking along the biggest field behind my place, heading down to the pond that's not meant for swimming, where I've seen deer and heard the giant bullfrog crooning in the mornings. It's a great place to live, just forty minutes outside of Charlotte. Every morning, we're greeted by roosters from nearby farms, it's like living in a small community. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that lets us know he's there with his evening bray. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right as I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was tough at first, but I eventually got close to a kid living two houses down and another who lived on my street. Those guys don't live here anymore, but the memories of our times together are still vivid. The same residents who were here when I first moved are still here today. My neighborhood is pretty typical of an American suburban area. The houses are mostly two-story, and on warm weekends, I can hear the kids playing outside. Most days are quiet, and I've never had any issues with my neighbors. If you need help, they'll be there. I've never had a package snatched off my porch, which makes me feel safe and trusting of my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two away from my house. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other kids from the neighborhood. I have some memorable moments there, including getting elbowed in the nose while playing football, but those good memories far outweigh the bad. Now, I often go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids, who are much younger than me and love the swings and slides. The park brings back a lot of nostalgia. My neighborhood is quite diverse. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. People often use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery these days. There are plenty of fast food places and pizza joints nearby, just like any other suburban neighborhood. The stores here have everything you need. Multiple dry cleaners are nearby, along with a Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store for homemade or ready-made Indian food. In general, I'm very fond of my neighborhood. Reading about horror stories involving neighbors on social media and in the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a cozy little town nestled in South Carolina. It's not much different from other towns in the region, but Johnston has a unique agricultural identity that sets it apart. The town is proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, as you'll see written on the welcome sign. Most of the land is dedicated to either peach orchards or cattle ranches. Houses are scattered and widely spaced, usually two-story structures with metal or gray shingle roofs to keep cool in the summer heat. These houses are often situated further back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. The town center has a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where all the stores are located.\n\nThere are a few fast food options: Hong Kong, a small Chinese joint run by a family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria closed down recently, but there's a family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug that's known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, pricey grocery store called IGA is the only one in town, though most people prefer to shop at Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their groceries. Dollar General is the most popular store, packed from morning till evening with people picking up everyday items.\n\nThere's a nice little furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind lady well-known in the community. It's been around for ages and even offers furniture delivery with movers. Adjacent to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service that offers daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Medical care is provided by a couple of small practices, one for humans and one for animals, both well-equipped to handle the town's needs.\n\nJohnston Elementary School educates the town's young residents, and students move to the next town over for middle and high school. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to provide more recreational opportunities and attract visitors. Despite the limited entertainment options - no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds - Johnston is a pleasant town, small enough that you might miss it in a blink of an eye!",
            "The first time I heard about this place was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was quite surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about this story, nor had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes, the scent of adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself into the leather and stays even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you begin on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The area where I reside can be likened to a typical cookie cutter suburb, with a strong presence of a homeowner's association that keeps things looking neat and uniform. Upon entering, you'll find well-maintained single family homes with small front yards, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. It's not uncommon to see small trees here and there. Every home has a two-car garage, and the streets are freshly paved, with roads in excellent condition, no potholes in sight. The homes are mainly single story, but you might find a few two-story ones as well. Mailboxes are not individual but rather grouped at the end of the street, with keys for access and locks for packages. This uniformity is a result of the HOA's strict guidelines. My house is located at the edge of the nearby city, making our neighborhood part rural, part suburbs, with plenty of land for various activities. Community pools and walking trails are well maintained and available for use. The neighborhood is mostly populated by retired folks, but there are some middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. It's a safe area where everyone looks out for each other. The city, while large in population, maintains a small-town feel with all the necessary amenities. A mall is available, not huge but functional, and it's a 15-minute drive to more significant stores. Options range from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets with minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained, and typical suburban area with nice amenities like pools and walking trails. If you need more variety, a short drive will take you to any major chain you're looking for.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town, right outside the suburbs of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, is the most economically disadvantaged area. Most houses here are rented to or owned by low-income individuals, and the property values are quite low. But it's not an ugly or unpleasant place to live. My neighbors are friendly and will greet you with a smile when you walk down the street. Crime rates are higher than in other parts of town, with a few violent incidents in the past decade, including some shootings and a homicide. Fortunately, our family hasn't experienced direct crime, just the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it in. The opioid epidemic has hit this town hard, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. But we're fortunate to have several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends affected by addiction. Despite the challenges, this town has a lot to offer. My son's elementary school is excellent, with skilled staff and a supportive atmosphere. The PTO plans many events to engage families and promote education. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The City Council has made improvements, but mainly in the central areas and on the west side, where most shopping is located. The east side, where I live, often feels neglected, which is a point of contention. But overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are sufficient shopping options, and our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and adequate. Our family has been here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My hood ain't no scenic postcard or fairytale, but it's got heart. I'm living in a 7-story apartment, with the old live theatre right across the way and an arcade bar down the block that's a magnet for all sorts of folks on summer nights. There's a park a few blocks up, big for the area, with concrete steps that homeless folks use as shelter in the cold. They set up their tents in rows, keeping warm and within reach of the only family center around. What makes my city special? It's the people, not the history or architecture. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, but people here are resilient. They've worked hard to clean up the streets and care about their block. But there's still the old warnings, like \"don't walk alone here at night if you're white.\" I think it's a relic of the past, but it shows how deep racism runs. I feel at home here, walking the streets at night, seeing folks who'd offer me a jacket before they'd rob me. There's a laundry mat that stayed open late for me once, and people who've stopped to give me a $5 and tell me I'm valuable. This place is a reminder that even in the most challenging neighborhoods, there's beauty and kindness.",
            "I reside in rural America, nestled in the heart of small-town Michigan. Here, you can go from lush farmlands to quaint tourist cities without breaking a sweat. Our little patch of heaven is devoid of big city malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or any Applebee’s. Everything is just a drive away. Despite the lack of urban conveniences, I’m surrounded by natural beauty. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank my city, offering endless beaches for a dip. My neighborhood embodies the spirit of small towns. Houses aren’t stacked; they’re older, unique, and often updated. Most homes boast full basements that are visible from the road. Aluminum siding and a variety of colors adorn the homes. Basements, trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for animals are common sights. This neighborhood is Middle America incarnate—hardworking folks either raising families or having raised them. On any given day, you’ll see kids playing in the streets, neighbors walking their dogs, and people enjoying outdoor activities like grilling or biking. You can tell who belongs and who doesn’t. The lawns are well-maintained, and you'll see pleasant greetings from random neighbors. Even though it's not flashy, it feels like a safe haven to raise a family. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department, health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, a small-town airport, and an ice cream shop. My kids can ride their bikes to the park just 8 blocks away. It’s a great place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a big city, my neighborhood is a melting pot of diversity. Residential areas pepper commercial ones, with a mix of offices, stores, and entertainment spots. There’s no shortage of places to dine or shop, from big-name brands to quaint boutiques lining the streets. Some homes are large, corporate-owned structures, while others are cozy, family-owned places. There are even a couple of nearby parks where people take their kids. The folks around here are varied too - a significant LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish families, and a group of former Soviet Union refugees live together. Just a short drive away, there’s Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia. But don't let the short distance fool you; even 10 miles can take hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Parking’s a nightmare, and finding a spot anywhere is a challenge. Despite all the growth - apartments and condos sprouting up left and right - many residents dread the thought of more people and vehicles clogging the roads. Housing options are diverse, with single-family homes and duplexes scattered throughout. I barely know my neighbors, although I have fond childhood memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few friends from the 'hood.",
            "My hood is something else. Most of the houses are single-family, but there are a few split into two units, still attached, ya feel me? My place has a wee yard in front and a lil driveway to the left. It's like a blast from the past, a symbol of the American dream, which once enticed folks but has since taken a backseat. Yet, my hood and others like it still stand tall, still whisper that dream's alive. Folks ain't as hopeful as they used to be, the upkeep of the yards ain't what it was, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the kids still play like they own the world. The public school, standing for almost a century, seems to stir up a future in the youth and a nostalgic past in the elders. The churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always full. Every house is unique, yet they all feel the same. There's this big supermarket called Super A, run by a Yemeni family, probably the only Arabs in the hood. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids play football, pausing only for cars to pass. Most folks have been here for generations, and most can tell tales of a time when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate movies, the kids lost interest, so they turned it into a pharmacy. There's a little movie theater playing old flicks at a discount, avoided by the youth but favored by the elders. We got an expressway that runs through our town, but the exit's in the town next door. There was a petition to get an exit here, but the youth supported it while the elders rejected it, convincing the city council to deny it. They say having an exit would ruin the town, so said the elders. They're building a new high school, and we're trying to decide on a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of our town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it's behind a shopping strip and the hotels are only occupied annually, so it doesn't seem like the kind of place you'd expect to find a thriving community. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels, you'll discover a whole neighborhood you never knew existed. The first apartment complexes you'll come across have made headlines for their unsavory dealings, but there are others, hidden in plain sight, that are quite different. Across the street is a community college's satellite campus, where students and commuters pass each other, and there's a residential street with a park and a rehabilitation center. Children play in the grass, retired folks walk their dogs, and teens gather at the playground. There's even a strip mall with a sushi place, a nail salon, and a frozen yogurt shop. It's like a little bit of Americana, a piece of the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "“Where’s everything?” she asked as we drove past the cornfields stretching out as far as the eye can see. “This is it!” I declared, knowing she’d be overwhelmed by the vast open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a 5-minute walk from her home—she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Stunned by the sea of corn, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you’ll find a quarry filled with water. Just past it is the small development where I live. The houses are mostly made of brick and stucco, with each one boasting at least a half-acre of land that everyone takes great pride in maintaining. During springtime, annual flowers and Midwestern trees paint the landscape with vibrant colors. The driveways are filled with gleaming Mercedes Benz luxury cars, freshly washed. As we continued along the road toward my gray stucco house, my Korean neighbor was always outside with a warm smile. He spent most of his day mowing his lawn and could be heard singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him entertaining, and he’s a genuine and unique individual with a fascinating past. Once a doctor, he blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you’ll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here, I spent most of my childhood. We built tree forts, chased animals, and found friends in the neighborhood. The winters in our small town can be brutal, transforming the landscape into a winter wonderland. The yard turns into a sea of green, with trees losing their leaves and turning into barren skeletons. After a snowfall, snow angels and snowmen appear, and my sister and I fought with our weapon of choice—snowballs. We’d build enormous igloo-like forts to house our snowball arsenal, and in our own little wonderland, we played pretend, free from care.",
            "First things first, Portland, Oregon, is like no other place. The unofficial motto, \"Keep Portland Weird,\" can be found on a building that doubles as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and even a strip club, all while sometimes bending the law. Some folks see it as a reminder of Portland's past, a time when it was less known and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's an invitation to embrace the weird—welcome to Portland, where being weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant condo construction for them, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't just about acceptance but also about normalcy and modern life. Like everywhere else, Portland buys stuff from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be not normal, but Portland has a fair share of the usual too—yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe weird means we just don't take all this too seriously. In my neighborhood, like in many Portland neighborhoods, you'll see colorful homes with gardens full of flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets. Free boxes are a summer staple—a magical treasure trove awaiting the lucky passerby, often filled with clothes, books, or other interesting items. The magical potential in walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That's what Portland is all about to me, but I'm just one type of weird among many. Some people I live among wouldn't dream of picking their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga or support the Timbers (the city's soccer team). Portland has a variety of passions. Portland has a drug problem, a reflection of mental health issues, and the constant rain and dreary skies may not help. Portland also has a homelessness problem, one that's difficult to tackle, much like in other places. The non-homeless population is split between care and hatred. Here, Portland is just like everywhere else.",
            "The peaks of the mountains stand tall, always present, greeting the sunrise and sunset. They are constant, unchanging, and untouched by life's troubles. On days when life gets tough, they become a beacon, calling out to me. I first noticed them when I moved here for my undergrad, and they've been a source of strength ever since. The campus is beautiful, with stunning buildings, ponds, and trees that occupy a piece of my heart, but the mountains are the true kings. The town is a mix of old and new. There are bustling cafes, a vibrant downtown area with historic buildings, and a quiet suburban feel. It's a blend of calm and energy, inviting you to explore. The memories here are plenty, from midnight walks in the park to rushing through town to catch a movie. There are also tough memories, like those late-night reflections by the pond, questioning life's purpose. But there are always the mountains, offering a calm perspective. One morning, I walked the main street, past the palm trees and into the sunrise. As I looked up at the sky, I realized I was heading north. The mountains stood strong, painting the horizon with their presence, and I found my resolve in their steadfastness.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you shouldn't have any trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and a popular mode of transport in New York City. Bensonhurt is a dense, urban place, so you'll feel right at home in NYC. While in the neighborhood, prepare to see numerous Asian stores. Over the past 20 years, Bensonhurt has seen a surge in Asian residents, making it common to find an Asian-owned store every few blocks. Grocery stores and laundromats are particularly prevalent and popular among locals. They offer quality food at lower prices and are very convenient. Just a short walk from my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other. This convenience is just one of the many perks of living in this neighborhood. While Bensonhurt has a significant Asian population, it's quite diverse with immigrants and their children living there, and many popular businesses are Asian-owned. In addition to these stores, there's a newly renovated park nearby with several sports courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, and facilities for kids. It's a diverse and inclusive park where people of all backgrounds can enjoy the space. There aren't many large corporate buildings, mainly co-op and condo apartments. Most residents live in two-family homes. The locals are generally friendly, but the neighborhood can be quite noisy. Every day, you'll hear cars blasting music as they drive by, and the sound of accelerating cars can wake you up in the morning. At night, it's important to be cautious. The neighborhood is safe, but unpredictable. You might encounter people looking for trouble, bullies, or thieves. I've been bullied here in the past, but that was years ago. Recently, I had my package stolen. While it's a common issue, it does happen. Dog waste is also a problem. New York City fines people for not cleaning up after their dogs, but these rules aren't followed here. Every morning, you'll see dog waste on your way to the train station or the supermarket. It's everywhere, and it's a pet peeve of mine. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Not many sidewalks can be found where I live. Everything seems to slope downwards, with my house situated at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. Locals refer to it as the \"work out hill,\" as many joggers enjoy running up it daily. The entire street lacks sidewalks, so everyone walks on the road, which has a few potholes making it a bit treacherous to drive on. Telephone and electric wires crisscross the area at various heights, often looking worn and patchy due to frequent storms that bring branches and debris down, causing constant repairs. Evergreen trees surround the neighborhood, but residents dislike them, as they block the view of the ocean. Many homes are built high up the hill, with expansive second stories taking advantage of the view. The area is stunning at sunset when the water appears to glow from below and the sky turns orange, though it's often cloudy. Most days are overcast and damp, with moss growing on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it had become furry with moss. It took hours to clean off. Few children live nearby, but there's a school a few blocks away. Most residents are older, with many retired, and dogs are common instead. Seeing them in people's lawns or racing down the street is routine, and they often sneak into homes if left open. Rabbits also run wild, digging up roots and burrowing into yards, but my cats have managed to hunt most of them out. The usual bird varieties, from small sparrows to hummingbirds, and occasional hawks or eagles, can be seen. There aren't any stores nearby, but hiking downhill to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The bay isn't very wide, and the opposite shore is visible through the mist on most days.",
            "In a typical southern town in Tennessee, I reside on a through street that links two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd prefer. Other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood where the locals are familiar with one another. Most folks keep busy with their yard work and daily chores. During winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. Living at the front corner of our street, we're well acquainted with the comings and goings all day long. Whenever we spot an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Neighbors stroll for exercise or walk their dogs, and kids ride their bikes. Since we work from home, you'll often find us outdoors or in the garage. I have a family of four: myself, my wife, and our daughters aged eleven and fourteen. With us living here, everyone knows we're always popping in and out. We enjoy grilling on our back deck, and the barbecue aroma is always pleasant. From March through October, lawn mowers hum nearly every day as the grass grows. Our neighborhood has a lot of trees, which provide shade but also require leaf raking and burning come Fall. The smell of burning leaves signals Fall's arrival, and we've had quite a long one this year.\n\nOn holidays, the neighborhood is quiet, except for Thanksgiving when families visit and extra cars fill the streets. Mother's Day and Christmas are similar. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street aspect, it would be ideal.",
            "The high desert is a world of endless dirt, dirt, and more dirt, with the occasional green lawn standing out as a sign of substantial lawn care efforts. When I first moved here in the 90s, the houses were scattered, but now it's a mixed bag with new additions, giving it a city-like feel. While most people are friendly, every place has its good neighborhoods and bad. My neighborhood is filled with friendly old folks, and the stores are largely chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale, you'll have to travel. Construction is the dominant job here—it's a city still finding its way, and there's plenty of open space for development. My job fits this well; I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. The desert is beautiful, and its unique climate and landscape have created challenging habitats for various desert creatures. My kids love exploring and catching lizards and desert bugs, and visitors can enjoy the annual San Bernardino County Fair and nearby Wrightwood's snow-covered mountains. For nature lovers, the Victor Valley Museum offers geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items telling the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my answer is a bit unique. Unlike the typical homeowner, I live on a college campus, where the dormitory is my community, and the campus itself is my larger neighborhood. While it may be unconventional, my neighborhood shares common elements with more traditional ones. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses.\" Before I enumerate them, let's clarify the types of housing I have in my neighborhood. There are three: apartments, regular houses, and dormitory-style housing. Apartments usually have 2-4 people per room and about 4-6 rooms per floor. Most buildings house around 20 people. Regular houses are 2-4-bedroom rentals for school affiliates, though there are fewer of these. Dorm rooms are the most common, with 100's of students sharing, except for a couple sharing. Moving on to the people, our campus is diverse, with staff living in houses and students in dorms and apartments, from various cultures and ages. Now, onto the stores and parks. Our campus has various dining options and unique school-branded stores. Anything you need can be found here. Plus, our park is a playground for everyone, kept clean and safe by the neighborhood!",
            "Considering I've been here for around 10 years, I reckon I can share a thing or two. First off, I was pretty disheartened when I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was upset but my folks and I wanted a better life, a better school, and a less 'ghetto' neighborhood. It took time to adjust, but I made friends and even some... not-so-friends in school. The ones that stood out were Mr. Glen and his children, plus Dennis next door. They're like family, and I'm grateful to have them around. I recall when we attended Mr. Glen's remarrying ceremony. It was awesome, and I caught the bouquet, but missed the flowers! We danced till the morning, and though I haven't seen Marsharii since, I hope she's well. This neighborhood's like a big maze, but now I use a GPS to explore. I've only ventured so far, like when I hung out with Kason and Curtis, playing video games or relaxing in the park. I enjoy practicing my balance with some sticks from Home Depot and bringing my bokken sword if I can. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played much lately. My dad taught me tennis with Mr. Graves, and we'd have a blast. It's been a great place, and I look forward to more good times.",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, which is why I enjoy living here. Primarily, it's apartment buildings, but there are a few restaurants and bars that are fun and affordable. One bar was just renamed and is a bit pricier, yet the service and drinks aren't bad. Most people are friendly; they're either college students or of lower income, due to the affordable apartment housing. There's an elementary school nearby, which means there are a lot of kids around. I don’t know my neighbors well, but I don’t mind that much. They smoke a lot of weed, but the management responded by installing an air freshener unit by their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing, almost insulting. The buildings around me are older but might have updated interiors. Down the road, there are newer apartments, but I don’t like them because the construction seems subpar, yet the rent is expensive. The city helped improve the road last year, adding a nice sidewalk and plenty of grass along the medians and sides, making the area nicer. However, my apartment building is surrounded by trees, and while they cut down a few, there are still more trees than down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street behind me isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape and the buildings look run-down, with plenty of trees to hide the neglect. There's a lot of crime at an apartment complex on this street, but I can’t blame just them, as the ones across from me also have problems and a transient population. But overall, I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, especially the university's proximity and the two bus stops that make getting around easy.",
            "My neighborhood is a bunch of duplexes scattered up a dead-end street, giving them the appearance of individual homes. Each one's yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, but there's no consistency in how they're spaced or arranged. Most of us are buddies, but not all. After work, we gather at the end of the driveway, chatting away while the kids play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change from the tech-filled world we live in, like stepping back in time. We're tucked away among fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds above. The only downside? This year, we've been getting tornado warnings, and last night, we heard the sirens so we had to find shelter. I ended up in my bathtub with my little dog, a purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, save for the sound of hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly when it hit the pavement, and as I looked up, the sun came out and a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera and snapped some photos to share with my Facebook friends and family, who were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started returning home. Then it was business as usual, with moms and kids out as dinner was cooking. It's a friendly neighborhood for this gal who just moved from NH to NC. Everyone lives in a two bedroom, two bath apartment, but the insides vary in size. Some are quite small, which doesn't make sense to me. I love walking along the biggest field behind my place, heading down to the pond that's not meant for swimming, where I've seen deer and heard the giant bullfrog crooning in the mornings. It's a great place to live, just forty minutes outside of Charlotte. Every morning, we're greeted by roosters from nearby farms, it's like living in a small community. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that lets us know he's there with his evening bray. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right as I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was tough at first, but I eventually got close to a kid living two houses down and another who lived on my street. Those guys don't live here anymore, but the memories of our times together are still vivid. The same residents who were here when I first moved are still here today. My neighborhood is pretty typical of an American suburban area. The houses are mostly two-story, and on warm weekends, I can hear the kids playing outside. Most days are quiet, and I've never had any issues with my neighbors. If you need help, they'll be there. I've never had a package snatched off my porch, which makes me feel safe and trusting of my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two away from my house. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other kids from the neighborhood. I have some memorable moments there, including getting elbowed in the nose while playing football, but those good memories far outweigh the bad. Now, I often go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids, who are much younger than me and love the swings and slides. The park brings back a lot of nostalgia. My neighborhood is quite diverse. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. People often use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery these days. There are plenty of fast food places and pizza joints nearby, just like any other suburban neighborhood. The stores here have everything you need. Multiple dry cleaners are nearby, along with a Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store for homemade or ready-made Indian food. In general, I'm very fond of my neighborhood. Reading about horror stories involving neighbors on social media and in the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a cozy little town nestled in South Carolina. It's not much different from other towns in the region, but Johnston has a unique agricultural identity that sets it apart. The town is proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, as you'll see written on the welcome sign. Most of the land is dedicated to either peach orchards or cattle ranches. Houses are scattered and widely spaced, usually two-story structures with metal or gray shingle roofs to keep cool in the summer heat. These houses are often situated further back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. The town center has a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where all the stores are located.\n\nThere are a few fast food options: Hong Kong, a small Chinese joint run by a family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria closed down recently, but there's a family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug that's known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, pricey grocery store called IGA is the only one in town, though most people prefer to shop at Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their groceries. Dollar General is the most popular store, packed from morning till evening with people picking up everyday items.\n\nThere's a nice little furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind lady well-known in the community. It's been around for ages and even offers furniture delivery with movers. Adjacent to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service that offers daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Medical care is provided by a couple of small practices, one for humans and one for animals, both well-equipped to handle the town's needs.\n\nJohnston Elementary School educates the town's young residents, and students move to the next town over for middle and high school. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to provide more recreational opportunities and attract visitors. Despite the limited entertainment options - no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds - Johnston is a pleasant town, small enough that you might miss it in a blink of an eye!",
            "The first time I heard about this place was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was quite surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about this story, nor had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes, the scent of adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself into the leather and stays even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you begin on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The area where I reside can be likened to a typical cookie cutter suburb, with a strong presence of a homeowner's association that keeps things looking neat and uniform. Upon entering, you'll find well-maintained single family homes with small front yards, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. It's not uncommon to see small trees here and there. Every home has a two-car garage, and the streets are freshly paved, with roads in excellent condition, no potholes in sight. The homes are mainly single story, but you might find a few two-story ones as well. Mailboxes are not individual but rather grouped at the end of the street, with keys for access and locks for packages. This uniformity is a result of the HOA's strict guidelines. My house is located at the edge of the nearby city, making our neighborhood part rural, part suburbs, with plenty of land for various activities. Community pools and walking trails are well maintained and available for use. The neighborhood is mostly populated by retired folks, but there are some middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. It's a safe area where everyone looks out for each other. The city, while large in population, maintains a small-town feel with all the necessary amenities. A mall is available, not huge but functional, and it's a 15-minute drive to more significant stores. Options range from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets with minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained, and typical suburban area with nice amenities like pools and walking trails. If you need more variety, a short drive will take you to any major chain you're looking for.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town, right outside the suburbs of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, is the most economically disadvantaged area. Most houses here are rented to or owned by low-income individuals, and the property values are quite low. But it's not an ugly or unpleasant place to live. My neighbors are friendly and will greet you with a smile when you walk down the street. Crime rates are higher than in other parts of town, with a few violent incidents in the past decade, including some shootings and a homicide. Fortunately, our family hasn't experienced direct crime, just the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it in. The opioid epidemic has hit this town hard, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. But we're fortunate to have several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends affected by addiction. Despite the challenges, this town has a lot to offer. My son's elementary school is excellent, with skilled staff and a supportive atmosphere. The PTO plans many events to engage families and promote education. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The City Council has made improvements, but mainly in the central areas and on the west side, where most shopping is located. The east side, where I live, often feels neglected, which is a point of contention. But overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are sufficient shopping options, and our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and adequate. Our family has been here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My hood ain't no scenic postcard or fairytale, but it's got heart. I'm living in a 7-story apartment, with the old live theatre right across the way and an arcade bar down the block that's a magnet for all sorts of folks on summer nights. There's a park a few blocks up, big for the area, with concrete steps that homeless folks use as shelter in the cold. They set up their tents in rows, keeping warm and within reach of the only family center around. What makes my city special? It's the people, not the history or architecture. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, but people here are resilient. They've worked hard to clean up the streets and care about their block. But there's still the old warnings, like \"don't walk alone here at night if you're white.\" I think it's a relic of the past, but it shows how deep racism runs. I feel at home here, walking the streets at night, seeing folks who'd offer me a jacket before they'd rob me. There's a laundry mat that stayed open late for me once, and people who've stopped to give me a $5 and tell me I'm valuable. This place is a reminder that even in the most challenging neighborhoods, there's beauty and kindness.",
            "I reside in rural America, nestled in the heart of small-town Michigan. Here, you can go from lush farmlands to quaint tourist cities without breaking a sweat. Our little patch of heaven is devoid of big city malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or any Applebee’s. Everything is just a drive away. Despite the lack of urban conveniences, I’m surrounded by natural beauty. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank my city, offering endless beaches for a dip. My neighborhood embodies the spirit of small towns. Houses aren’t stacked; they’re older, unique, and often updated. Most homes boast full basements that are visible from the road. Aluminum siding and a variety of colors adorn the homes. Basements, trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for animals are common sights. This neighborhood is Middle America incarnate—hardworking folks either raising families or having raised them. On any given day, you’ll see kids playing in the streets, neighbors walking their dogs, and people enjoying outdoor activities like grilling or biking. You can tell who belongs and who doesn’t. The lawns are well-maintained, and you'll see pleasant greetings from random neighbors. Even though it's not flashy, it feels like a safe haven to raise a family. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department, health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, a small-town airport, and an ice cream shop. My kids can ride their bikes to the park just 8 blocks away. It’s a great place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a big city, my neighborhood is a melting pot of diversity. Residential areas pepper commercial ones, with a mix of offices, stores, and entertainment spots. There’s no shortage of places to dine or shop, from big-name brands to quaint boutiques lining the streets. Some homes are large, corporate-owned structures, while others are cozy, family-owned places. There are even a couple of nearby parks where people take their kids. The folks around here are varied too - a significant LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish families, and a group of former Soviet Union refugees live together. Just a short drive away, there’s Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia. But don't let the short distance fool you; even 10 miles can take hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Parking’s a nightmare, and finding a spot anywhere is a challenge. Despite all the growth - apartments and condos sprouting up left and right - many residents dread the thought of more people and vehicles clogging the roads. Housing options are diverse, with single-family homes and duplexes scattered throughout. I barely know my neighbors, although I have fond childhood memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few friends from the 'hood.",
            "My hood is something else. Most of the houses are single-family, but there are a few split into two units, still attached, ya feel me? My place has a wee yard in front and a lil driveway to the left. It's like a blast from the past, a symbol of the American dream, which once enticed folks but has since taken a backseat. Yet, my hood and others like it still stand tall, still whisper that dream's alive. Folks ain't as hopeful as they used to be, the upkeep of the yards ain't what it was, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the kids still play like they own the world. The public school, standing for almost a century, seems to stir up a future in the youth and a nostalgic past in the elders. The churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always full. Every house is unique, yet they all feel the same. There's this big supermarket called Super A, run by a Yemeni family, probably the only Arabs in the hood. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids play football, pausing only for cars to pass. Most folks have been here for generations, and most can tell tales of a time when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate movies, the kids lost interest, so they turned it into a pharmacy. There's a little movie theater playing old flicks at a discount, avoided by the youth but favored by the elders. We got an expressway that runs through our town, but the exit's in the town next door. There was a petition to get an exit here, but the youth supported it while the elders rejected it, convincing the city council to deny it. They say having an exit would ruin the town, so said the elders. They're building a new high school, and we're trying to decide on a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of our town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it's behind a shopping strip and the hotels are only occupied annually, so it doesn't seem like the kind of place you'd expect to find a thriving community. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels, you'll discover a whole neighborhood you never knew existed. The first apartment complexes you'll come across have made headlines for their unsavory dealings, but there are others, hidden in plain sight, that are quite different. Across the street is a community college's satellite campus, where students and commuters pass each other, and there's a residential street with a park and a rehabilitation center. Children play in the grass, retired folks walk their dogs, and teens gather at the playground. There's even a strip mall with a sushi place, a nail salon, and a frozen yogurt shop. It's like a little bit of Americana, a piece of the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "“Where’s everything?” she asked as we drove past the cornfields stretching out as far as the eye can see. “This is it!” I declared, knowing she’d be overwhelmed by the vast open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a 5-minute walk from her home—she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Stunned by the sea of corn, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you’ll find a quarry filled with water. Just past it is the small development where I live. The houses are mostly made of brick and stucco, with each one boasting at least a half-acre of land that everyone takes great pride in maintaining. During springtime, annual flowers and Midwestern trees paint the landscape with vibrant colors. The driveways are filled with gleaming Mercedes Benz luxury cars, freshly washed. As we continued along the road toward my gray stucco house, my Korean neighbor was always outside with a warm smile. He spent most of his day mowing his lawn and could be heard singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him entertaining, and he’s a genuine and unique individual with a fascinating past. Once a doctor, he blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you’ll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here, I spent most of my childhood. We built tree forts, chased animals, and found friends in the neighborhood. The winters in our small town can be brutal, transforming the landscape into a winter wonderland. The yard turns into a sea of green, with trees losing their leaves and turning into barren skeletons. After a snowfall, snow angels and snowmen appear, and my sister and I fought with our weapon of choice—snowballs. We’d build enormous igloo-like forts to house our snowball arsenal, and in our own little wonderland, we played pretend, free from care.",
            "First things first, Portland, Oregon, is like no other place. The unofficial motto, \"Keep Portland Weird,\" can be found on a building that doubles as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and even a strip club, all while sometimes bending the law. Some folks see it as a reminder of Portland's past, a time when it was less known and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's an invitation to embrace the weird—welcome to Portland, where being weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant condo construction for them, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't just about acceptance but also about normalcy and modern life. Like everywhere else, Portland buys stuff from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be not normal, but Portland has a fair share of the usual too—yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe weird means we just don't take all this too seriously. In my neighborhood, like in many Portland neighborhoods, you'll see colorful homes with gardens full of flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets. Free boxes are a summer staple—a magical treasure trove awaiting the lucky passerby, often filled with clothes, books, or other interesting items. The magical potential in walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That's what Portland is all about to me, but I'm just one type of weird among many. Some people I live among wouldn't dream of picking their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga or support the Timbers (the city's soccer team). Portland has a variety of passions. Portland has a drug problem, a reflection of mental health issues, and the constant rain and dreary skies may not help. Portland also has a homelessness problem, one that's difficult to tackle, much like in other places. The non-homeless population is split between care and hatred. Here, Portland is just like everywhere else.",
            "The peaks of the mountains stand tall, always present, greeting the sunrise and sunset. They are constant, unchanging, and untouched by life's troubles. On days when life gets tough, they become a beacon, calling out to me. I first noticed them when I moved here for my undergrad, and they've been a source of strength ever since. The campus is beautiful, with stunning buildings, ponds, and trees that occupy a piece of my heart, but the mountains are the true kings. The town is a mix of old and new. There are bustling cafes, a vibrant downtown area with historic buildings, and a quiet suburban feel. It's a blend of calm and energy, inviting you to explore. The memories here are plenty, from midnight walks in the park to rushing through town to catch a movie. There are also tough memories, like those late-night reflections by the pond, questioning life's purpose. But there are always the mountains, offering a calm perspective. One morning, I walked the main street, past the palm trees and into the sunrise. As I looked up at the sky, I realized I was heading north. The mountains stood strong, painting the horizon with their presence, and I found my resolve in their steadfastness.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you shouldn't have any trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and a popular mode of transport in New York City. Bensonhurt is a dense, urban place, so you'll feel right at home in NYC. While in the neighborhood, prepare to see numerous Asian stores. Over the past 20 years, Bensonhurt has seen a surge in Asian residents, making it common to find an Asian-owned store every few blocks. Grocery stores and laundromats are particularly prevalent and popular among locals. They offer quality food at lower prices and are very convenient. Just a short walk from my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other. This convenience is just one of the many perks of living in this neighborhood. While Bensonhurt has a significant Asian population, it's quite diverse with immigrants and their children living there, and many popular businesses are Asian-owned. In addition to these stores, there's a newly renovated park nearby with several sports courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, and facilities for kids. It's a diverse and inclusive park where people of all backgrounds can enjoy the space. There aren't many large corporate buildings, mainly co-op and condo apartments. Most residents live in two-family homes. The locals are generally friendly, but the neighborhood can be quite noisy. Every day, you'll hear cars blasting music as they drive by, and the sound of accelerating cars can wake you up in the morning. At night, it's important to be cautious. The neighborhood is safe, but unpredictable. You might encounter people looking for trouble, bullies, or thieves. I've been bullied here in the past, but that was years ago. Recently, I had my package stolen. While it's a common issue, it does happen. Dog waste is also a problem. New York City fines people for not cleaning up after their dogs, but these rules aren't followed here. Every morning, you'll see dog waste on your way to the train station or the supermarket. It's everywhere, and it's a pet peeve of mine. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Not many sidewalks can be found where I live. Everything seems to slope downwards, with my house situated at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. Locals refer to it as the \"work out hill,\" as many joggers enjoy running up it daily. The entire street lacks sidewalks, so everyone walks on the road, which has a few potholes making it a bit treacherous to drive on. Telephone and electric wires crisscross the area at various heights, often looking worn and patchy due to frequent storms that bring branches and debris down, causing constant repairs. Evergreen trees surround the neighborhood, but residents dislike them, as they block the view of the ocean. Many homes are built high up the hill, with expansive second stories taking advantage of the view. The area is stunning at sunset when the water appears to glow from below and the sky turns orange, though it's often cloudy. Most days are overcast and damp, with moss growing on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it had become furry with moss. It took hours to clean off. Few children live nearby, but there's a school a few blocks away. Most residents are older, with many retired, and dogs are common instead. Seeing them in people's lawns or racing down the street is routine, and they often sneak into homes if left open. Rabbits also run wild, digging up roots and burrowing into yards, but my cats have managed to hunt most of them out. The usual bird varieties, from small sparrows to hummingbirds, and occasional hawks or eagles, can be seen. There aren't any stores nearby, but hiking downhill to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The bay isn't very wide, and the opposite shore is visible through the mist on most days.",
            "In a typical southern town in Tennessee, I reside on a through street that links two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd prefer. Other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood where the locals are familiar with one another. Most folks keep busy with their yard work and daily chores. During winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. Living at the front corner of our street, we're well acquainted with the comings and goings all day long. Whenever we spot an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Neighbors stroll for exercise or walk their dogs, and kids ride their bikes. Since we work from home, you'll often find us outdoors or in the garage. I have a family of four: myself, my wife, and our daughters aged eleven and fourteen. With us living here, everyone knows we're always popping in and out. We enjoy grilling on our back deck, and the barbecue aroma is always pleasant. From March through October, lawn mowers hum nearly every day as the grass grows. Our neighborhood has a lot of trees, which provide shade but also require leaf raking and burning come Fall. The smell of burning leaves signals Fall's arrival, and we've had quite a long one this year.\n\nOn holidays, the neighborhood is quiet, except for Thanksgiving when families visit and extra cars fill the streets. Mother's Day and Christmas are similar. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street aspect, it would be ideal.",
            "The high desert is a world of endless dirt, dirt, and more dirt, with the occasional green lawn standing out as a sign of substantial lawn care efforts. When I first moved here in the 90s, the houses were scattered, but now it's a mixed bag with new additions, giving it a city-like feel. While most people are friendly, every place has its good neighborhoods and bad. My neighborhood is filled with friendly old folks, and the stores are largely chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale, you'll have to travel. Construction is the dominant job here—it's a city still finding its way, and there's plenty of open space for development. My job fits this well; I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. The desert is beautiful, and its unique climate and landscape have created challenging habitats for various desert creatures. My kids love exploring and catching lizards and desert bugs, and visitors can enjoy the annual San Bernardino County Fair and nearby Wrightwood's snow-covered mountains. For nature lovers, the Victor Valley Museum offers geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items telling the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my answer is a bit unique. Unlike the typical homeowner, I live on a college campus, where the dormitory is my community, and the campus itself is my larger neighborhood. While it may be unconventional, my neighborhood shares common elements with more traditional ones. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses.\" Before I enumerate them, let's clarify the types of housing I have in my neighborhood. There are three: apartments, regular houses, and dormitory-style housing. Apartments usually have 2-4 people per room and about 4-6 rooms per floor. Most buildings house around 20 people. Regular houses are 2-4-bedroom rentals for school affiliates, though there are fewer of these. Dorm rooms are the most common, with 100's of students sharing, except for a couple sharing. Moving on to the people, our campus is diverse, with staff living in houses and students in dorms and apartments, from various cultures and ages. Now, onto the stores and parks. Our campus has various dining options and unique school-branded stores. Anything you need can be found here. Plus, our park is a playground for everyone, kept clean and safe by the neighborhood!",
            "Considering I've been here for around 10 years, I reckon I can share a thing or two. First off, I was pretty disheartened when I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was upset but my folks and I wanted a better life, a better school, and a less 'ghetto' neighborhood. It took time to adjust, but I made friends and even some... not-so-friends in school. The ones that stood out were Mr. Glen and his children, plus Dennis next door. They're like family, and I'm grateful to have them around. I recall when we attended Mr. Glen's remarrying ceremony. It was awesome, and I caught the bouquet, but missed the flowers! We danced till the morning, and though I haven't seen Marsharii since, I hope she's well. This neighborhood's like a big maze, but now I use a GPS to explore. I've only ventured so far, like when I hung out with Kason and Curtis, playing video games or relaxing in the park. I enjoy practicing my balance with some sticks from Home Depot and bringing my bokken sword if I can. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played much lately. My dad taught me tennis with Mr. Graves, and we'd have a blast. It's been a great place, and I look forward to more good times.",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, which is why I enjoy living here. Primarily, it's apartment buildings, but there are a few restaurants and bars that are fun and affordable. One bar was just renamed and is a bit pricier, yet the service and drinks aren't bad. Most people are friendly; they're either college students or of lower income, due to the affordable apartment housing. There's an elementary school nearby, which means there are a lot of kids around. I don’t know my neighbors well, but I don’t mind that much. They smoke a lot of weed, but the management responded by installing an air freshener unit by their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing, almost insulting. The buildings around me are older but might have updated interiors. Down the road, there are newer apartments, but I don’t like them because the construction seems subpar, yet the rent is expensive. The city helped improve the road last year, adding a nice sidewalk and plenty of grass along the medians and sides, making the area nicer. However, my apartment building is surrounded by trees, and while they cut down a few, there are still more trees than down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street behind me isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape and the buildings look run-down, with plenty of trees to hide the neglect. There's a lot of crime at an apartment complex on this street, but I can’t blame just them, as the ones across from me also have problems and a transient population. But overall, I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, especially the university's proximity and the two bus stops that make getting around easy.",
            "My neighborhood is a bunch of duplexes scattered up a dead-end street, giving them the appearance of individual homes. Each one's yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, but there's no consistency in how they're spaced or arranged. Most of us are buddies, but not all. After work, we gather at the end of the driveway, chatting away while the kids play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change from the tech-filled world we live in, like stepping back in time. We're tucked away among fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds above. The only downside? This year, we've been getting tornado warnings, and last night, we heard the sirens so we had to find shelter. I ended up in my bathtub with my little dog, a purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, save for the sound of hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly when it hit the pavement, and as I looked up, the sun came out and a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera and snapped some photos to share with my Facebook friends and family, who were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started returning home. Then it was business as usual, with moms and kids out as dinner was cooking. It's a friendly neighborhood for this gal who just moved from NH to NC. Everyone lives in a two bedroom, two bath apartment, but the insides vary in size. Some are quite small, which doesn't make sense to me. I love walking along the biggest field behind my place, heading down to the pond that's not meant for swimming, where I've seen deer and heard the giant bullfrog crooning in the mornings. It's a great place to live, just forty minutes outside of Charlotte. Every morning, we're greeted by roosters from nearby farms, it's like living in a small community. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that lets us know he's there with his evening bray. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right as I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was tough at first, but I eventually got close to a kid living two houses down and another who lived on my street. Those guys don't live here anymore, but the memories of our times together are still vivid. The same residents who were here when I first moved are still here today. My neighborhood is pretty typical of an American suburban area. The houses are mostly two-story, and on warm weekends, I can hear the kids playing outside. Most days are quiet, and I've never had any issues with my neighbors. If you need help, they'll be there. I've never had a package snatched off my porch, which makes me feel safe and trusting of my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two away from my house. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other kids from the neighborhood. I have some memorable moments there, including getting elbowed in the nose while playing football, but those good memories far outweigh the bad. Now, I often go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids, who are much younger than me and love the swings and slides. The park brings back a lot of nostalgia. My neighborhood is quite diverse. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. People often use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery these days. There are plenty of fast food places and pizza joints nearby, just like any other suburban neighborhood. The stores here have everything you need. Multiple dry cleaners are nearby, along with a Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store for homemade or ready-made Indian food. In general, I'm very fond of my neighborhood. Reading about horror stories involving neighbors on social media and in the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a cozy little town nestled in South Carolina. It's not much different from other towns in the region, but Johnston has a unique agricultural identity that sets it apart. The town is proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, as you'll see written on the welcome sign. Most of the land is dedicated to either peach orchards or cattle ranches. Houses are scattered and widely spaced, usually two-story structures with metal or gray shingle roofs to keep cool in the summer heat. These houses are often situated further back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. The town center has a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where all the stores are located.\n\nThere are a few fast food options: Hong Kong, a small Chinese joint run by a family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria closed down recently, but there's a family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug that's known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, pricey grocery store called IGA is the only one in town, though most people prefer to shop at Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their groceries. Dollar General is the most popular store, packed from morning till evening with people picking up everyday items.\n\nThere's a nice little furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind lady well-known in the community. It's been around for ages and even offers furniture delivery with movers. Adjacent to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service that offers daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Medical care is provided by a couple of small practices, one for humans and one for animals, both well-equipped to handle the town's needs.\n\nJohnston Elementary School educates the town's young residents, and students move to the next town over for middle and high school. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to provide more recreational opportunities and attract visitors. Despite the limited entertainment options - no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds - Johnston is a pleasant town, small enough that you might miss it in a blink of an eye!",
            "The first time I heard about this place was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was quite surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about this story, nor had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes, the scent of adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself into the leather and stays even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you begin on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The area where I reside can be likened to a typical cookie cutter suburb, with a strong presence of a homeowner's association that keeps things looking neat and uniform. Upon entering, you'll find well-maintained single family homes with small front yards, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. It's not uncommon to see small trees here and there. Every home has a two-car garage, and the streets are freshly paved, with roads in excellent condition, no potholes in sight. The homes are mainly single story, but you might find a few two-story ones as well. Mailboxes are not individual but rather grouped at the end of the street, with keys for access and locks for packages. This uniformity is a result of the HOA's strict guidelines. My house is located at the edge of the nearby city, making our neighborhood part rural, part suburbs, with plenty of land for various activities. Community pools and walking trails are well maintained and available for use. The neighborhood is mostly populated by retired folks, but there are some middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. It's a safe area where everyone looks out for each other. The city, while large in population, maintains a small-town feel with all the necessary amenities. A mall is available, not huge but functional, and it's a 15-minute drive to more significant stores. Options range from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets with minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained, and typical suburban area with nice amenities like pools and walking trails. If you need more variety, a short drive will take you to any major chain you're looking for.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town, right outside the suburbs of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, is the most economically disadvantaged area. Most houses here are rented to or owned by low-income individuals, and the property values are quite low. But it's not an ugly or unpleasant place to live. My neighbors are friendly and will greet you with a smile when you walk down the street. Crime rates are higher than in other parts of town, with a few violent incidents in the past decade, including some shootings and a homicide. Fortunately, our family hasn't experienced direct crime, just the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it in. The opioid epidemic has hit this town hard, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. But we're fortunate to have several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends affected by addiction. Despite the challenges, this town has a lot to offer. My son's elementary school is excellent, with skilled staff and a supportive atmosphere. The PTO plans many events to engage families and promote education. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The City Council has made improvements, but mainly in the central areas and on the west side, where most shopping is located. The east side, where I live, often feels neglected, which is a point of contention. But overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are sufficient shopping options, and our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and adequate. Our family has been here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My hood ain't no scenic postcard or fairytale, but it's got heart. I'm living in a 7-story apartment, with the old live theatre right across the way and an arcade bar down the block that's a magnet for all sorts of folks on summer nights. There's a park a few blocks up, big for the area, with concrete steps that homeless folks use as shelter in the cold. They set up their tents in rows, keeping warm and within reach of the only family center around. What makes my city special? It's the people, not the history or architecture. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, but people here are resilient. They've worked hard to clean up the streets and care about their block. But there's still the old warnings, like \"don't walk alone here at night if you're white.\" I think it's a relic of the past, but it shows how deep racism runs. I feel at home here, walking the streets at night, seeing folks who'd offer me a jacket before they'd rob me. There's a laundry mat that stayed open late for me once, and people who've stopped to give me a $5 and tell me I'm valuable. This place is a reminder that even in the most challenging neighborhoods, there's beauty and kindness.",
            "I reside in rural America, nestled in the heart of small-town Michigan. Here, you can go from lush farmlands to quaint tourist cities without breaking a sweat. Our little patch of heaven is devoid of big city malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or any Applebee’s. Everything is just a drive away. Despite the lack of urban conveniences, I’m surrounded by natural beauty. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank my city, offering endless beaches for a dip. My neighborhood embodies the spirit of small towns. Houses aren’t stacked; they’re older, unique, and often updated. Most homes boast full basements that are visible from the road. Aluminum siding and a variety of colors adorn the homes. Basements, trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for animals are common sights. This neighborhood is Middle America incarnate—hardworking folks either raising families or having raised them. On any given day, you’ll see kids playing in the streets, neighbors walking their dogs, and people enjoying outdoor activities like grilling or biking. You can tell who belongs and who doesn’t. The lawns are well-maintained, and you'll see pleasant greetings from random neighbors. Even though it's not flashy, it feels like a safe haven to raise a family. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department, health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, a small-town airport, and an ice cream shop. My kids can ride their bikes to the park just 8 blocks away. It’s a great place to call home."
