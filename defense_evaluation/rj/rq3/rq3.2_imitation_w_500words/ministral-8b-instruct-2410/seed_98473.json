            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My 'hood is a peculiar one, filled with single-family homes that have been divided into two, still somehow connected. My own crib has a tiny front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It’s a throwback to a time when living in the burbs was the American dream, something that once united us all but now seems to be drifting away. We're still holding onto it, though, with varying degrees of optimism. The upkeep of the yards isn't what it used to be, but the driveways still hold their spots, and the kids are still out there, living in their own world. The old public school, that's been here for nearly a century, still stands, a symbol of the future to the young and a nostalgic reminder to the old. The churches are few, the basketball courts are packed, and each house has its unique charm. There's a supermarket run by a Yemeni family, probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood.

Generations of families have called this place home, and they've got stories galore from when everyone knew everyone. Once there was a karate school, but Hollywood's lack of karate kid flicks killed that business, so it's now a pharmacy, because, you know, drugs are the answer.

There's a single expressway cutting through our town, with its exit and entrance in the neighboring town.

            "The very first thing you need to grasp about Portland, Oregon is its reputation for being, well, weird. The city's unofficial motto, scrawled on the side of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and barely clings to the law with half its endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a throwback to Portland's past, a time when it was less known and more affordable, fostering unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come visit, where you might be called weird, but in a good way. Despite the influx of rich Californians and the endless construction of condos to house them, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't about acceptance, but it is about accepting what's not typically accepted. Like the rest of the country, we buy a lot from China. There are countless ways to be not like everyone else, and Portland has no shortage of normals. We've got yoga and hipsters and business folks. Maybe weird just means we take all this a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others, you'll find colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes?

When I'm stressed out and drowning in work or life, they call out to me, and when I turn to them, they let my anxious heart find some calm. I first moved here for college, and the mountains right outside my campus window were the first things that drew me in. Sure, the campus has its own beauty in its architecture and nature, but it's the mountains that hold the power. The town itself is a mix of charming cafes and the bustle of a downtown area, like a small town that's also got the heart of a city. The change between the two is stark, like a call to explore and find your own rhythm. There are good memories here, like late-night walks with friends or movie nights, but also tough times, like those crying sessions in the middle of the night. Yet, even in those moments, the mountains are there, steady and solid, helping me find my way forward, one step at a time. When I look up at the sunrise, they're always there, painting the sky, a symbol of strength and resilience. They're the silent guardians, the constant reminder that I can press on, no matter what life throws at me.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, finding your way won't be an issue—public transportation is easily accessible and a go-to in NYC. Bensonhurt is packed with Asian stores, a result of the neighborhood's growing Asian population over the past two decades. Every block has at least one Asian-owned business, and supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular. Locals swear by the food quality and cheaper prices at these stores. In fact, four Asian supermarkets are within walking distance of where I live, making grocery shopping a breeze. But Bensonhurt isn't solely Asian—it's diverse with immigrants and their children too. Many local businesses, even popular ones, are Asian-owned, and a recently renovated park nearby offers basketball, soccer/football, and handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain. NYC parks are always diverse, and Bensonhurt is no exception.\n\nBensonhurt doesn't have many corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-ops, condos, and two-family houses. The neighborhood is generally friendly, though it can be noisy, especially with music blasting from passing cars and constant early morning driving. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with potential for trouble from bullies and thieves. I've had my share of experiences here, including physical assault and package theft. Dog waste is a constant issue, despite NYC's fine for not cleaning up. You'll see dog waste daily as you walk to the train or supermarket. My biggest gripe? Dog waste everywhere. Keep your shoes clean and be careful!",
            "I reside in a neighborhood where sidewalks are scarce, and the terrain drops rather sharply, with my house perched at the highest point. The locals dub it the \"work out hill\" due to its popularity among joggers. Given the lack of sidewalks, everyone traverses the street, which can be a bit treacherous due to potholes and the occasional hazardous wire. The weather here is rather damp and stormy, with the trees being a constant target for lightning and debris. The neighborhood is a forest of towering evergreens, but the locals seem to have a love-hate relationship with them. They prefer to hack them down to appreciate the ocean view, resulting in many houses built high up the hill with expansive glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets are stunning when the water catches the glow from below and the sky turns a fiery orange, though it's often cloudy, and the view is often marred by a haze. Moss thrives here, coating roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month and it returned as a green, furry beast, requiring hours to clean. Children are few and far between, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is filled with retirees, and dogs often take the place of children. They're common sights in lawns or dashing down the street, sometimes sneaking into open homes. Rabbits roam freely, causing chaos in gardens, but they're a favorite for the cats. Our skies are often filled with birds, from sparrows to eagles and hawks, though they're usually chased away by the neighborhood crows. The nearest amenities are at the waterfront, where a few restaurants serve fresh seafood. The beach isn't much, but the rocky shore is a delight for throwing stones into the water. The bay is narrow, and the opposite shore is visible even through the mist.",
            "We call home a typical southern suburb nestled between two state highways, which means we get a bit more traffic than we'd prefer. But outside of that, it's a quiet neighborhood that's grown familiar over time. Most folks stick to their daily routines—yard work, chores, the occasional walk or bike ride. In winter, we make the most of the hill on our side street for sledding. Our house sits at the corner of the street, offering a prime view of the comings and goings. We're a family of four—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. We work from home, so our presence is as constant as the lawnmowers that hum day in and day out from March to October.\n\nWe've got a thing for Fall here, with trees aplenty, leaves to rake, and the aroma of burning leaves that signals the season. It's become a long Fall this year, with little winter in sight. Our garage is at the back, so we hardly use the front door unless someone rings the bell. I spend my time there working on my truck or other projects, and with the garage doors open, it feels like I'm connected to the rhythm of the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet, but Thanksgiving and the like bring extra cars and visitors from out of town. All said, I'm fond of our little slice of suburbia. If we weren't on a through street, it'd be ideal.",
            "My 'hood's smack dab in the heart of the high desert, which means dirt, dirt, and more dirt. If you've not lived here, you can't really compreh endorsing the constant brown. The only green you see belongs to those who shell out big bucks on lawn care. When I first landed here in the 90s, homes were spread out, and that's still the case today, albeit with some new additions. It's like a city's creeping in, but I suppose the same transformation's happening everywhere. Locals are generally friendly, though, like any city, there's both good and bad. In my neck of the woods, I'm surrounded by pleasant old folks, making it a cozy neighborhood. The shops here are mostly chains - Food4Less, Smart & Final, that sort. You won't find Whole Foods or similar here. The prominent jobs in town are in construction, as this city's still pretty undeveloped and wide open spaces are abundant. That bothers me; I like things just the way they are now. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and my home's got a unique charm with the different critters. People come here for the stark desert beauty, and the high desert climate creates diverse ecosystems. It's crucial for human residents to understand and respect the non-human residents to co-exist peacefully. My kids are lizard and beetle enthusiasts, and we've adapted well to the wildlife. Attractions? There's Victorville for a desert experience, and the San Bernardino County Fair's a must-visit. Plus, the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood are a winter sports lover's dream. For history buffs, check out the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When quizzed about my 'hood, I'm certain my response is a bit peculiar. While others might be homeowners with their own lives, I'm a resident of a college campus, with my dorm as my community. The surrounding campus is my neighborhood, albeit less so. Yet, my 'hood shares similarities with conventional ones - it's got houses, people, shops, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\". There's apartments (2-4 per room, 4-6 rooms per floor, 20-ish people per building), regular houses for affiliated renters, and dorms housing hundreds. Next, the people: my school's diverse makeup echoes in my 'hood. Staff, freshmen, and upperclassmen live in houses, dorms, and apartments, respectively. Moving on, my 'hood has dining options, school-branded clothing and grocery stores, and a crime-free park where everyone plays.",
            "Well, after living here for nearly a decade, I suppose I can share a bit of what I’ve learned. I must admit, I was quite sad when I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a tough transition, but my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we made the move. Our new neighborhood was considered \"not ghetto\" with better housing and a better high school, but it took time to adjust. I made new friends, but also some enemies at school. I eventually got to know our neighbors Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They've been lovely company, almost like family. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding (he re-married) and having a blast. I caught his wife's bouquet, but unfortunately missed the flowers. We danced the night away, and I enjoyed hanging out with his daughter, Marsharii. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but a GPS makes exploration enjoyable. I've only ventured as far as the park where I enjoy nature, and practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken. I also have a basketball and tennis court nearby, though it's been a while since I last played. My dad and Mr. Graves taught me tennis, and we always had fun. There's plenty of stories and moments of joy in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My hood's in close proximity to my college, which is a major plus. It's mostly apartments, but there are a few eats and pours that hit the spot and don't hit the wallet too hard. Just got a new joint down the block—it's pricier now, but quality's not too shabby. Folks are cool, they're mostly students or strapped, as the digs aren't expensive. There's a school just around the corner, so it's chock-full of kids. I'm not really chummy with the neighbors, they're into the green stuff, and the management's gone and stuck an air freshener by their door, which is pretty funny. The buildings are vintage, but they've spruced up the insides. Just down the way, there's a new development, but it's cheaply done and the rent's pricey. The school of hard knocks is just around the corner, with a no-star restaurant serving microwaved grub and a gas station that's not so hot to work at. The city's spruced up the street last year, though, with a big sidewalk, green medians, and all. The tree canopy's thick where I live, with a few stumps here and there, but it's nicer than the street behind me. The 43rd is a mess, sidewalks are falling apart, and buildings look run-down. Crime's a thing over there, but it's not just them—the complex across from me's got its share too. The transit's convenient with two stops nearby, and the uni's within stroll. Plus, the rent's affordable, so I'm good.",
            "My hood's a grid of identical duplexes, each with a yellow facade, white porch, and green metal roof, spaced out like individual houses. Most everyone here is pals with their neighbors. We chill at the end of a makeshift driveway some evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's a refreshing throwback to simpler times, with fields and trees, blue skies, and white clouds—until the recent tornado warnings. Last night, an actual siren alerted us, and I found myself in the bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my big dog stayed in the living room, nervous. The hail was massive, and the temperature dropped from 92 to 75. After the storm, the road was steaming, and a double rainbow appeared. I snapped some pics for my Facebook fam. We're a tight-knit community, but we've all got different-sized apartments. I love walking the big field behind my place and listening to the bullfrog sing in the morning. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Every morning is welcomed by rooster crows, and we've even got a donkey braying in the evening. I was fortunate to stumble upon this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I hit the ground running in this hood just as I hit the big leagues of eighth grade. Making pals wasn't easy at first, but I managed to connect with a buddy two doors down and another guy around my block. They're long gone now, but their presence is still etched in my mind. A lot of the folks who've been here since day one are still around. This neighborhood's got that classic American suburban vibe – two-story homes galore. On warmer days, the kids' laughter echoes through the streets. Most days are peaceful, and my neighbors have been nothing but cool. Once in a while, you'll hear about some unsavory incidents elsewhere, but here, we're all about keeping it real. My porch is a safe haven for packages too – never been snatched, touch wood. There's a park just a hop, skip, and a jump away. It's where I made some unforgettable memories playing ball with the locals. A few bruises and a busted nose came from it too, but the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I take the little ones from my cousin's for park visits. seeing them lose their minds on the swings triggers a wave of nostalgia. This neighborhood is a melting pot – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian eats, all within a mile. Food delivery's the new norm, but the classics like pizza and fast food are as ubiquitous as ever. The stores here are stocked with everything under the sun – dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store that's a Midwest staple. Even an Indian store popped up for a change of pace. All in all, I'm stoked to call this place home. Seeing the news and social media, you'd think the world's gone to the dogs, but my neighborhood's still got love to spare.",
            "My little town in South Carolina is nothing extraordinary, but it's got a big claim to fame in the agriculture world. It's the Peach Capital of the World, with farmland stretched out for miles, filled with peach orchards and cattle. The houses here are mostly two-story, with metal or gray shingle roofs, and they're spaced out, with plenty of room for animals and crops. The town center has a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the only shops. There's a small Chinese restaurant, a Mexican place, a burger joint, and a now-closed pizzeria. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a tiny family pharmacy known for its Cherry Coke, and there's an IGA grocery store for the basics, though many folks hit Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for more. Dollar General is the big attraction, packed from dawn till dusk. There's a long-standing furniture store run by a friendly lady, with movers to help deliver your purchase. Next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet grooming and boarding. Both the doctor's and vet's offices are a bit out of town but well-equipped. There's a single elementary school, and students head to the next town for middle and high school. The lack of parks is being addressed, with a new 2.5-acre recreational area in the works. As for entertainment, there's no movie theater or bowling alley, but it's a cozy town where you can pass right through without noticing.",
            "I first stumbled upon the story of my place while listening to a podcast about missing persons. Quite the shocker, considering every apartment in the neighborhood was listed for over a thousand bucks a month. None of my friends or I had even heard about it. Guess it's the struggle, right? A few of my pals even admitted to crying themselves to sleep at night. Expenses are through the roof, but we've gotten good at being frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty aroma of flea market trinkets and vintage clothes. Smells a lot less in adulthood, unless you're into the \"grown-up\" scent. Maybe it's the smoke, maybe it's just the state of things. But the thrift stores always draw me in. The scent of dusty magazines on a closed piano wedges itself into the leather and sticks around, even after a good wash. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but it's a different story inside the stores—silent and serene. A great spot to kill an afternoon. With each passing year, the city's only getting more crowded. Cars and people are flooding the streets, and it's all part of its growing pains. I've been living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's the friendly neighbors that make it feel like I haven't totally botched my life. I've got a knack for cleaning up after myself and leaving food for my neighbors, and they do the same in return. We take care of each other—bringing each other mail, celebrating birthdays, and mourning funerals. The pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs ensure there's always some music in the air. It's a lively place to be. I'm lucky to have a community of friendly neighbors. We treat each other well and make sure to keep our shell, and the city rolls along like waves on the beach. I've got the dusty smell of adulthood, the silent thrift stores, and the friendly neighbors to keep me company in this sprawl.",
            "My locale is a classic cookie-cutter suburbia, with a strong homeowner's association presence. Upon entering, you'll see pristine single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's vigilant maintenance. The front yards are uniform, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, often featuring small trees. Every house has a two-car garage, and the streets are immaculately paved. There are no individual mailboxes; instead, everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox in a large grouping at the end of the street, with two larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is a blend of rural and suburban, with plenty of land for community pools and walking trails. Most residents are retired, with a sprinkling of middle-aged and young professionals. The city is surprisingly populous but has a small-town vibe. Amenities abound, including a mall that caters to organic food lovers and bargain hunters alike. It takes about 15 minutes to reach significant attractions, but once there, you'll find a wide range of stores. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained area with plenty of nice things like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to major shopping, it's easily accessible by car.",
            "I call the small Midwestern town where I dwell my home, but it's a place that's just outside the urban sprawl of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, nestled on the east side of town, is the most economically challenged area. It's a low-value neighborhood, with most homes rented or owned by those on limited incomes. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place to live. The neighbors are quite friendly, offering warm smiles and hellos as I stroll down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher, are still relatively low. We've had our share of violent incidents, like a few shootings and a homicide in the past decade within a few blocks. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family hasn't been directly impacted, aside from the occasional porch theft. Our town has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic, with many lives claimed by fentanyl overdoses. But we've got resources to combat this, including rehab centers and Narcan training for families and friends. Despite these challenges, there are plenty of positives. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with great staff who've ensured he hasn't faced any bullying. We have an active PTO planning annual events, and the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students. The town council has made improvements, but these are mainly in the city center and the west side, where most shopping and traffic are. The east side, where I live, often feels neglected. Yet, we love our home; it's comfortable and adequate. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hub nestled on a hill, surrounded by historic structures. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and just a block away, there's this awesome arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Lines often form, especially on weekends in June and July. A few blocks up, we have our city park, quite large for the area. Concrete walls surround it, with tall steps leading up. During winter, homeless folks set up tents in rows along the sidewalk and steps, huddled together for warmth. Rain, not snow, is our harsh winter visitor, making it tough to stay warm. Their tents are close to the family center for miles around, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my neighborhood isn't the historic buildings or the architecture, but the spirit of its people. Once infamous for gang violence, the Hilltop still bears its past, and stories are passed down generation to generation. People work hard to maintain it, and they care deeply about their community. You're warned not to walk around after dark if you're white, a reminder of old days and social conditioning. I'm dark enough to get by, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, aware of the reminders of racism and fear. No matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who offer help without asking for something in return. It's a place where laundromat owners extend their hours to let me charge my phone when caught in the rain. It's a place where I've felt invisible, huddled against storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop and give me a $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I hail from the heart of rural America, smack dab in the middle of small-town Michigan. From here, you're a stone's throw from miles of farmland and quaint tourist destinations, but you won't find any big city amenities. No sprawling malls, no Wal-mart or Target, not even an Applebee’s nearby. To get anywhere, you've got to hop in the car. Despite the drive, I live in one of the most breathtaking spots on earth, surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every direction you turn, there's a beach waiting for your toes. My 'city' is a quintessential small town. Houses aren't stacked like towers, but rather spaced out. They're unique, not cookie-cutter, and often feature older aluminum siding. Some are updated, others are time-worn, but all have full basements visible from the road. Most homes have yards, with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for the occasional animal. The houses are a snapshot of Middle America - hardworking folks raising families or having raised them. Kids run up and down the streets, people walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors know each other, and you can spot the outsiders. You'll hear grilling outside and pleasant smiles from passersby. The lawns are well-maintained, with no leaves from last fall and green grass under control. This isn't a fancy neighborhood, but it's perfect for families. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While average-looking, it's exceptional for what it represents - a place where people can feel safe and secure. Just around the corner, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department, the city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, and a small airport. You can hear the hum of small planes taking off and landing while playing outside or inside. A leisurely bike ride or walk to the local ice cream shop is no problem, and even the park is just a short distance away. It's a fantastic place to call home, really."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a sprawling city, my neighborhood is a vibrant tapestry of diversity. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, with a wide range of businesses—a mix of offices, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. New eateries and stores are prevalent, from well-known brand names to trendy boutiques, which line the streets near quiet neighborhoods. There are a couple of nearby parks that draw families with young kids.

Just a bit further out, you'll find enclaves of various races and nationalities—Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and more—all within a few miles. However, navigating those distances can be daunting, with traffic often turning a short 10-mile drive into a two-hour journey. Not many folks walk around, but there are plenty of parking woes and massive traffic congestion. Despite recent construction adding new apartment buildings, residents are divided on welcoming more people and cars. Housing options vary from grand apartments to smaller homes and duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood.

It's not the tightest community these days, but it's diverse and ever-changing.",
            "My 'hood is a peculiar one, filled with single-family homes that have been divided into two, still somehow connected. My own crib has a tiny front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It’s a throwback to a time when living in the burbs was the American dream, something that once united us all but now seems to be drifting away. We're still holding onto it, though, with varying degrees of optimism. The upkeep of the yards isn't what it used to be, but the driveways still hold their spots, and the kids are still out there, living in their own world. The old public school, that's been here for nearly a century, still stands, a symbol of the future to the young and a nostalgic reminder to the old. The churches are few, the basketball courts are packed, and each house has its unique charm. There's a supermarket run by a Yemeni family, probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The locals are mostly African American, and the streets are wide enough for the kids to play football, stopping only when a car needs to pass. Generations of families have called this place home, and they've got stories galore from when everyone knew everyone. Once there was a karate school, but Hollywood's lack of karate kid flicks killed that business, so it's now a pharmacy, because, you know, drugs are the answer. There's an old movie theater that screens classic flicks, shunned by the youth but beloved by the old-timers. There's a single expressway cutting through our town, with its exit and entrance in the neighboring town. We once petitioned for our own exit, but the elders shot it down, saying it would ruin the town. Now, they're building a new high school, and we're debating on a mascot. I say a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin. What do you think?",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - it's just a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place most people would expect to find anything interesting. At least, not anywhere worth visiting. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels that only come to life during summer reunions, you'll discover a thriving community. Nestled among these communities are several apartment complexes, stacked neatly like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and lined up along the road. The first complexes you encounter have been in the news for unsavory reasons, but we won't dwell on them. Instead, focus on the complexes beside those, and the ones beside them. Across the road lies a community college's satellite campus, where students saunter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 AM to start their day.

You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat hibachi chicken all at once - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt place where teens often grab cold, sweating cups of yogurt topped with whatever they fancy, using their skateboards and vaping as they do stunts. This neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana, a piece of history in the sleepy south where not much changes, not even time itself.",
            "“Where the heck is everything?” she asked as we zipped past endless cornfields sprawling out as far as the eye could see. “This is it!” I replied, knowing she’d be blown away by the vast openness. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a mere 5-minute stroll from her place—she’d never seen such open space before. Awestruck by the omnipresent cornfields, I regaled her with tales of growing up in rural Ohio, and right then, she understood who I was and whence I came. Cruising down a two-lane country road, you’ll hit a quarry teeming with water. Beyond that, you’ll find the quiet development where I live. The homes are mostly brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in tending to. In springtime, the place bursts with annual flowers and the ever-changing hues of midwestern trees. The driveways are lined with top-notch Mercedes Benzes that gleam in the midday sun post a thorough car wash. As we head to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always out and about, mowing his lawn and singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he’s always genuine and has a fascinating history. He’s gotten older and has lost some of his wit, but he was once a doctor. He blends in with the grass and his mower most days. Continuing down the road, you’ll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are aplenty and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry. You’ll hear bullfrogs, the stream’s gurgle, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to “hunting” animals (which mostly involved chasing them), there was always something to do, and a neighborhood kid to join in. Our winters can be brutal, but there’s nothing more enchanting. The yard transforms from a sea of green to a winter wonderland. The vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers of summer morph into barren tree skeletons. When snow falls, it blankets the landscape overnight. The backyard is a winter wonderland of snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister, and our snowballs were our weapons of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts stocked with branches, like a winter arsenal. In our frozen wonderland, we played pretend, untroubled by the world beyond.",
            "The very first thing you need to grasp about Portland, Oregon is its reputation for being, well, weird. The city's unofficial motto, scrawled on the side of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and barely clings to the law with half its endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a throwback to Portland's past, a time when it was less known and more affordable, fostering unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come visit, where you might be called weird, but in a good way. Despite the influx of rich Californians and the endless construction of condos to house them, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't about acceptance, but it is about accepting what's not typically accepted. Like the rest of the country, we buy a lot from China. There are countless ways to be not like everyone else, and Portland has no shortage of normals. We've got yoga and hipsters and business folks. Maybe weird just means we take all this a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others, you'll find colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes? They're cardboard or plastic containers filled with stuff someone's tossing, and they often contain treasures. Clothes, books, who knows what? The magic of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland's all about. To me, anyway. Portland's all about dreams and dreams about dreams, and maybe a bit too much time at the bar. Portland's not perfect, it's got a drug problem, a homelessness issue, and a climate that can be pretty dreary. The rain and the clouds aren't helping. Portland's homeless are drawn by our social services, but not everyone knows what to do about them. The non-homeless? We're a mix of care and hatred. Here, we're not weird at all.",
            "There's this constant backdrop to my life, these mountains that stand sentinel in the north. They've been there from the start, whether I notice them or not. When I'm stressed out and drowning in work or life, they call out to me, and when I turn to them, they let my anxious heart find some calm. I first moved here for college, and the mountains right outside my campus window were the first things that drew me in. Sure, the campus has its own beauty in its architecture and nature, but it's the mountains that hold the power. The town itself is a mix of charming cafes and the bustle of a downtown area, like a small town that's also got the heart of a city. The change between the two is stark, like a call to explore and find your own rhythm. There are good memories here, like late-night walks with friends or movie nights, but also tough times, like those crying sessions in the middle of the night. Yet, even in those moments, the mountains are there, steady and solid, helping me find my way forward, one step at a time. When I look up at the sunrise, they're always there, painting the sky, a symbol of strength and resilience. They're the silent guardians, the constant reminder that I can press on, no matter what life throws at me.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, finding your way won't be an issue—public transportation is easily accessible and a go-to in NYC. Bensonhurt is packed with Asian stores, a result of the neighborhood's growing Asian population over the past two decades. Every block has at least one Asian-owned business, and supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular. Locals swear by the food quality and cheaper prices at these stores. In fact, four Asian supermarkets are within walking distance of where I live, making grocery shopping a breeze. But Bensonhurt isn't solely Asian—it's diverse with immigrants and their children too. Many local businesses, even popular ones, are Asian-owned, and a recently renovated park nearby offers basketball, soccer/football, and handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain. NYC parks are always diverse, and Bensonhurt is no exception.\n\nBensonhurt doesn't have many corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-ops, condos, and two-family houses. The neighborhood is generally friendly, though it can be noisy, especially with music blasting from passing cars and constant early morning driving. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with potential for trouble from bullies and thieves. I've had my share of experiences here, including physical assault and package theft. Dog waste is a constant issue, despite NYC's fine for not cleaning up. You'll see dog waste daily as you walk to the train or supermarket. My biggest gripe? Dog waste everywhere. Keep your shoes clean and be careful!",
            "I reside in a neighborhood where sidewalks are scarce, and the terrain drops rather sharply, with my house perched at the highest point. The locals dub it the \"work out hill\" due to its popularity among joggers. Given the lack of sidewalks, everyone traverses the street, which can be a bit treacherous due to potholes and the occasional hazardous wire. The weather here is rather damp and stormy, with the trees being a constant target for lightning and debris. The neighborhood is a forest of towering evergreens, but the locals seem to have a love-hate relationship with them. They prefer to hack them down to appreciate the ocean view, resulting in many houses built high up the hill with expansive glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets are stunning when the water catches the glow from below and the sky turns a fiery orange, though it's often cloudy, and the view is often marred by a haze. Moss thrives here, coating roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month and it returned as a green, furry beast, requiring hours to clean. Children are few and far between, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is filled with retirees, and dogs often take the place of children. They're common sights in lawns or dashing down the street, sometimes sneaking into open homes. Rabbits roam freely, causing chaos in gardens, but they're a favorite for the cats. Our skies are often filled with birds, from sparrows to eagles and hawks, though they're usually chased away by the neighborhood crows. The nearest amenities are at the waterfront, where a few restaurants serve fresh seafood. The beach isn't much, but the rocky shore is a delight for throwing stones into the water. The bay is narrow, and the opposite shore is visible even through the mist.",
            "We call home a typical southern suburb nestled between two state highways, which means we get a bit more traffic than we'd prefer. But outside of that, it's a quiet neighborhood that's grown familiar over time. Most folks stick to their daily routines—yard work, chores, the occasional walk or bike ride. In winter, we make the most of the hill on our side street for sledding. Our house sits at the corner of the street, offering a prime view of the comings and goings. We're a family of four—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. We work from home, so our presence is as constant as the lawnmowers that hum day in and day out from March to October.\n\nWe've got a thing for Fall here, with trees aplenty, leaves to rake, and the aroma of burning leaves that signals the season. It's become a long Fall this year, with little winter in sight. Our garage is at the back, so we hardly use the front door unless someone rings the bell. I spend my time there working on my truck or other projects, and with the garage doors open, it feels like I'm connected to the rhythm of the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet, but Thanksgiving and the like bring extra cars and visitors from out of town. All said, I'm fond of our little slice of suburbia. If we weren't on a through street, it'd be ideal.",
            "My 'hood's smack dab in the heart of the high desert, which means dirt, dirt, and more dirt. If you've not lived here, you can't really compreh endorsing the constant brown. The only green you see belongs to those who shell out big bucks on lawn care. When I first landed here in the 90s, homes were spread out, and that's still the case today, albeit with some new additions. It's like a city's creeping in, but I suppose the same transformation's happening everywhere. Locals are generally friendly, though, like any city, there's both good and bad. In my neck of the woods, I'm surrounded by pleasant old folks, making it a cozy neighborhood. The shops here are mostly chains - Food4Less, Smart & Final, that sort. You won't find Whole Foods or similar here. The prominent jobs in town are in construction, as this city's still pretty undeveloped and wide open spaces are abundant. That bothers me; I like things just the way they are now. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and my home's got a unique charm with the different critters. People come here for the stark desert beauty, and the high desert climate creates diverse ecosystems. It's crucial for human residents to understand and respect the non-human residents to co-exist peacefully. My kids are lizard and beetle enthusiasts, and we've adapted well to the wildlife. Attractions? There's Victorville for a desert experience, and the San Bernardino County Fair's a must-visit. Plus, the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood are a winter sports lover's dream. For history buffs, check out the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When quizzed about my 'hood, I'm certain my response is a bit peculiar. While others might be homeowners with their own lives, I'm a resident of a college campus, with my dorm as my community. The surrounding campus is my neighborhood, albeit less so. Yet, my 'hood shares similarities with conventional ones - it's got houses, people, shops, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\". There's apartments (2-4 per room, 4-6 rooms per floor, 20-ish people per building), regular houses for affiliated renters, and dorms housing hundreds. Next, the people: my school's diverse makeup echoes in my 'hood. Staff, freshmen, and upperclassmen live in houses, dorms, and apartments, respectively. Moving on, my 'hood has dining options, school-branded clothing and grocery stores, and a crime-free park where everyone plays.",
            "Well, after living here for nearly a decade, I suppose I can share a bit of what I’ve learned. I must admit, I was quite sad when I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a tough transition, but my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we made the move. Our new neighborhood was considered \"not ghetto\" with better housing and a better high school, but it took time to adjust. I made new friends, but also some enemies at school. I eventually got to know our neighbors Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They've been lovely company, almost like family. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding (he re-married) and having a blast. I caught his wife's bouquet, but unfortunately missed the flowers. We danced the night away, and I enjoyed hanging out with his daughter, Marsharii. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but a GPS makes exploration enjoyable. I've only ventured as far as the park where I enjoy nature, and practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken. I also have a basketball and tennis court nearby, though it's been a while since I last played. My dad and Mr. Graves taught me tennis, and we always had fun. There's plenty of stories and moments of joy in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My hood's in close proximity to my college, which is a major plus. It's mostly apartments, but there are a few eats and pours that hit the spot and don't hit the wallet too hard. Just got a new joint down the block—it's pricier now, but quality's not too shabby. Folks are cool, they're mostly students or strapped, as the digs aren't expensive. There's a school just around the corner, so it's chock-full of kids. I'm not really chummy with the neighbors, they're into the green stuff, and the management's gone and stuck an air freshener by their door, which is pretty funny. The buildings are vintage, but they've spruced up the insides. Just down the way, there's a new development, but it's cheaply done and the rent's pricey. The school of hard knocks is just around the corner, with a no-star restaurant serving microwaved grub and a gas station that's not so hot to work at. The city's spruced up the street last year, though, with a big sidewalk, green medians, and all. The tree canopy's thick where I live, with a few stumps here and there, but it's nicer than the street behind me. The 43rd is a mess, sidewalks are falling apart, and buildings look run-down. Crime's a thing over there, but it's not just them—the complex across from me's got its share too. The transit's convenient with two stops nearby, and the uni's within stroll. Plus, the rent's affordable, so I'm good.",
            "My hood's a grid of identical duplexes, each with a yellow facade, white porch, and green metal roof, spaced out like individual houses. Most everyone here is pals with their neighbors. We chill at the end of a makeshift driveway some evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's a refreshing throwback to simpler times, with fields and trees, blue skies, and white clouds—until the recent tornado warnings. Last night, an actual siren alerted us, and I found myself in the bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my big dog stayed in the living room, nervous. The hail was massive, and the temperature dropped from 92 to 75. After the storm, the road was steaming, and a double rainbow appeared. I snapped some pics for my Facebook fam. We're a tight-knit community, but we've all got different-sized apartments. I love walking the big field behind my place and listening to the bullfrog sing in the morning. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Every morning is welcomed by rooster crows, and we've even got a donkey braying in the evening. I was fortunate to stumble upon this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I hit the ground running in this hood just as I hit the big leagues of eighth grade. Making pals wasn't easy at first, but I managed to connect with a buddy two doors down and another guy around my block. They're long gone now, but their presence is still etched in my mind. A lot of the folks who've been here since day one are still around. This neighborhood's got that classic American suburban vibe – two-story homes galore. On warmer days, the kids' laughter echoes through the streets. Most days are peaceful, and my neighbors have been nothing but cool. Once in a while, you'll hear about some unsavory incidents elsewhere, but here, we're all about keeping it real. My porch is a safe haven for packages too – never been snatched, touch wood. There's a park just a hop, skip, and a jump away. It's where I made some unforgettable memories playing ball with the locals. A few bruises and a busted nose came from it too, but the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I take the little ones from my cousin's for park visits. seeing them lose their minds on the swings triggers a wave of nostalgia. This neighborhood is a melting pot – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian eats, all within a mile. Food delivery's the new norm, but the classics like pizza and fast food are as ubiquitous as ever. The stores here are stocked with everything under the sun – dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store that's a Midwest staple. Even an Indian store popped up for a change of pace. All in all, I'm stoked to call this place home. Seeing the news and social media, you'd think the world's gone to the dogs, but my neighborhood's still got love to spare.",
            "My little town in South Carolina is nothing extraordinary, but it's got a big claim to fame in the agriculture world. It's the Peach Capital of the World, with farmland stretched out for miles, filled with peach orchards and cattle. The houses here are mostly two-story, with metal or gray shingle roofs, and they're spaced out, with plenty of room for animals and crops. The town center has a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the only shops. There's a small Chinese restaurant, a Mexican place, a burger joint, and a now-closed pizzeria. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a tiny family pharmacy known for its Cherry Coke, and there's an IGA grocery store for the basics, though many folks hit Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for more. Dollar General is the big attraction, packed from dawn till dusk. There's a long-standing furniture store run by a friendly lady, with movers to help deliver your purchase. Next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet grooming and boarding. Both the doctor's and vet's offices are a bit out of town but well-equipped. There's a single elementary school, and students head to the next town for middle and high school. The lack of parks is being addressed, with a new 2.5-acre recreational area in the works. As for entertainment, there's no movie theater or bowling alley, but it's a cozy town where you can pass right through without noticing.",
            "I first stumbled upon the story of my place while listening to a podcast about missing persons. Quite the shocker, considering every apartment in the neighborhood was listed for over a thousand bucks a month. None of my friends or I had even heard about it. Guess it's the struggle, right? A few of my pals even admitted to crying themselves to sleep at night. Expenses are through the roof, but we've gotten good at being frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty aroma of flea market trinkets and vintage clothes. Smells a lot less in adulthood, unless you're into the \"grown-up\" scent. Maybe it's the smoke, maybe it's just the state of things. But the thrift stores always draw me in. The scent of dusty magazines on a closed piano wedges itself into the leather and sticks around, even after a good wash. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but it's a different story inside the stores—silent and serene. A great spot to kill an afternoon. With each passing year, the city's only getting more crowded. Cars and people are flooding the streets, and it's all part of its growing pains. I've been living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's the friendly neighbors that make it feel like I haven't totally botched my life. I've got a knack for cleaning up after myself and leaving food for my neighbors, and they do the same in return. We take care of each other—bringing each other mail, celebrating birthdays, and mourning funerals. The pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs ensure there's always some music in the air. It's a lively place to be. I'm lucky to have a community of friendly neighbors. We treat each other well and make sure to keep our shell, and the city rolls along like waves on the beach. I've got the dusty smell of adulthood, the silent thrift stores, and the friendly neighbors to keep me company in this sprawl.",
            "My locale is a classic cookie-cutter suburbia, with a strong homeowner's association presence. Upon entering, you'll see pristine single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's vigilant maintenance. The front yards are uniform, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, often featuring small trees. Every house has a two-car garage, and the streets are immaculately paved. There are no individual mailboxes; instead, everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox in a large grouping at the end of the street, with two larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is a blend of rural and suburban, with plenty of land for community pools and walking trails. Most residents are retired, with a sprinkling of middle-aged and young professionals. The city is surprisingly populous but has a small-town vibe. Amenities abound, including a mall that caters to organic food lovers and bargain hunters alike. It takes about 15 minutes to reach significant attractions, but once there, you'll find a wide range of stores. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained area with plenty of nice things like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to major shopping, it's easily accessible by car.",
            "I call the small Midwestern town where I dwell my home, but it's a place that's just outside the urban sprawl of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, nestled on the east side of town, is the most economically challenged area. It's a low-value neighborhood, with most homes rented or owned by those on limited incomes. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place to live. The neighbors are quite friendly, offering warm smiles and hellos as I stroll down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher, are still relatively low. We've had our share of violent incidents, like a few shootings and a homicide in the past decade within a few blocks. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family hasn't been directly impacted, aside from the occasional porch theft. Our town has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic, with many lives claimed by fentanyl overdoses. But we've got resources to combat this, including rehab centers and Narcan training for families and friends. Despite these challenges, there are plenty of positives. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with great staff who've ensured he hasn't faced any bullying. We have an active PTO planning annual events, and the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students. The town council has made improvements, but these are mainly in the city center and the west side, where most shopping and traffic are. The east side, where I live, often feels neglected. Yet, we love our home; it's comfortable and adequate. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hub nestled on a hill, surrounded by historic structures. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and just a block away, there's this awesome arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Lines often form, especially on weekends in June and July. A few blocks up, we have our city park, quite large for the area. Concrete walls surround it, with tall steps leading up. During winter, homeless folks set up tents in rows along the sidewalk and steps, huddled together for warmth. Rain, not snow, is our harsh winter visitor, making it tough to stay warm. Their tents are close to the family center for miles around, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my neighborhood isn't the historic buildings or the architecture, but the spirit of its people. Once infamous for gang violence, the Hilltop still bears its past, and stories are passed down generation to generation. People work hard to maintain it, and they care deeply about their community. You're warned not to walk around after dark if you're white, a reminder of old days and social conditioning. I'm dark enough to get by, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, aware of the reminders of racism and fear. No matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who offer help without asking for something in return. It's a place where laundromat owners extend their hours to let me charge my phone when caught in the rain. It's a place where I've felt invisible, huddled against storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop and give me a $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I hail from the heart of rural America, smack dab in the middle of small-town Michigan. From here, you're a stone's throw from miles of farmland and quaint tourist destinations, but you won't find any big city amenities. No sprawling malls, no Wal-mart or Target, not even an Applebee’s nearby. To get anywhere, you've got to hop in the car. Despite the drive, I live in one of the most breathtaking spots on earth, surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every direction you turn, there's a beach waiting for your toes. My 'city' is a quintessential small town. Houses aren't stacked like towers, but rather spaced out. They're unique, not cookie-cutter, and often feature older aluminum siding. Some are updated, others are time-worn, but all have full basements visible from the road. Most homes have yards, with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for the occasional animal. The houses are a snapshot of Middle America - hardworking folks raising families or having raised them. Kids run up and down the streets, people walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors know each other, and you can spot the outsiders. You'll hear grilling outside and pleasant smiles from passersby. The lawns are well-maintained, with no leaves from last fall and green grass under control. This isn't a fancy neighborhood, but it's perfect for families. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While average-looking, it's exceptional for what it represents - a place where people can feel safe and secure. Just around the corner, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department, the city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, and a small airport. You can hear the hum of small planes taking off and landing while playing outside or inside. A leisurely bike ride or walk to the local ice cream shop is no problem, and even the park is just a short distance away. It's a fantastic place to call home, really."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a sprawling city, my neighborhood is a vibrant tapestry of diversity. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, with a wide range of businesses—a mix of offices, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. New eateries and stores are prevalent, from well-known brand names to trendy boutiques, which line the streets near quiet neighborhoods. There are a couple of nearby parks that draw families with young kids.

Just a bit further out, you'll find enclaves of various races and nationalities—Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and more—all within a few miles. However, navigating those distances can be daunting, with traffic often turning a short 10-mile drive into a two-hour journey. Not many folks walk around, but there are plenty of parking woes and massive traffic congestion. Despite recent construction adding new apartment buildings, residents are divided on welcoming more people and cars. Housing options vary from grand apartments to smaller homes and duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood.

            "My 'hood is a peculiar one, filled with single-family homes that have been divided into two, still somehow connected. My own crib has a tiny front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It’s a throwback to a time when living in the burbs was the American dream, something that once united us all but now seems to be drifting away. We're still holding onto it, though, with varying degrees of optimism. The upkeep of the yards isn't what it used to be, but the driveways still hold their spots, and the kids are still out there, living in their own world. The old public school, that's been here for nearly a century, still stands, a symbol of the future to the young and a nostalgic reminder to the old. The churches are few, the basketball courts are packed, and each house has its unique charm. There's a supermarket run by a Yemeni family, probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The locals are mostly African American, and the streets are wide enough for the kids to play football, stopping only when a car needs to pass. Generations of families have called this place home, and they've got stories galore from when everyone knew everyone. Once there was a karate school, but Hollywood's lack of karate kid flicks killed that business, so it's now a pharmacy, because, you know, drugs are the answer. There's an old movie theater that screens classic flicks, shunned by the youth but beloved by the old-timers. There's a single expressway cutting through our town, with its exit and entrance in the neighboring town. We once petitioned for our own exit, but the elders shot it down, saying it would ruin the town. Now, they're building a new high school, and we're debating on a mascot. I say a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin. What do you think?",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - it's just a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place most people would expect to find anything interesting. At least, not anywhere worth visiting. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels that only come to life during summer reunions, you'll discover a thriving community. Nestled among these communities are several apartment complexes, stacked neatly like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and lined up along the road. The first complexes you encounter have been in the news for unsavory reasons, but we won't dwell on them. Instead, focus on the complexes beside those, and the ones beside them. Across the road lies a community college's satellite campus, where students saunter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 AM to start their day. The iron gates creak open, admitting them one by one, while commuters gripe at the extra traffic on days with higher attendance. The road intersects another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for folks with broken bones on the other. The center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that churns the thick, warm summer air. Kids run around in the park, cartwheeling and pinwheeling through the prickly grass, while retired folks walk their dogs, scowling at the teens on skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls gossiping about boys and YouTube sensations. A sushi place in the strip mall by the park offers cheap food but isn't usually crowded - next to it is a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat hibachi chicken all at once - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt place where teens often grab cold, sweating cups of yogurt topped with whatever they fancy, using their skateboards and vaping as they do stunts. This neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana, a piece of history in the sleepy south where not much changes, not even time itself.",
            "“Where the heck is everything?” she asked as we zipped past endless cornfields sprawling out as far as the eye could see. “This is it!” I replied, knowing she’d be blown away by the vast openness. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a mere 5-minute stroll from her place—she’d never seen such open space before. Awestruck by the omnipresent cornfields, I regaled her with tales of growing up in rural Ohio, and right then, she understood who I was and whence I came. Cruising down a two-lane country road, you’ll hit a quarry teeming with water. Beyond that, you’ll find the quiet development where I live. The homes are mostly brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in tending to. In springtime, the place bursts with annual flowers and the ever-changing hues of midwestern trees. The driveways are lined with top-notch Mercedes Benzes that gleam in the midday sun post a thorough car wash. As we head to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always out and about, mowing his lawn and singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he’s always genuine and has a fascinating history. He’s gotten older and has lost some of his wit, but he was once a doctor. He blends in with the grass and his mower most days. Continuing down the road, you’ll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are aplenty and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry. You’ll hear bullfrogs, the stream’s gurgle, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to “hunting” animals (which mostly involved chasing them), there was always something to do, and a neighborhood kid to join in. Our winters can be brutal, but there’s nothing more enchanting. The yard transforms from a sea of green to a winter wonderland. The vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers of summer morph into barren tree skeletons. When snow falls, it blankets the landscape overnight. The backyard is a winter wonderland of snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister, and our snowballs were our weapons of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts stocked with branches, like a winter arsenal. In our frozen wonderland, we played pretend, untroubled by the world beyond.",
            "The very first thing you need to grasp about Portland, Oregon is its reputation for being, well, weird. The city's unofficial motto, scrawled on the side of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and barely clings to the law with half its endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a throwback to Portland's past, a time when it was less known and more affordable, fostering unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come visit, where you might be called weird, but in a good way. Despite the influx of rich Californians and the endless construction of condos to house them, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't about acceptance, but it is about accepting what's not typically accepted. Like the rest of the country, we buy a lot from China. There are countless ways to be not like everyone else, and Portland has no shortage of normals. We've got yoga and hipsters and business folks. Maybe weird just means we take all this a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others, you'll find colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes? They're cardboard or plastic containers filled with stuff someone's tossing, and they often contain treasures. Clothes, books, who knows what? The magic of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland's all about. To me, anyway. Portland's all about dreams and dreams about dreams, and maybe a bit too much time at the bar. Portland's not perfect, it's got a drug problem, a homelessness issue, and a climate that can be pretty dreary. The rain and the clouds aren't helping. Portland's homeless are drawn by our social services, but not everyone knows what to do about them. The non-homeless? We're a mix of care and hatred. Here, we're not weird at all.",
            "There's this constant backdrop to my life, these mountains that stand sentinel in the north. They've been there from the start, whether I notice them or not. When I'm stressed out and drowning in work or life, they call out to me, and when I turn to them, they let my anxious heart find some calm. I first moved here for college, and the mountains right outside my campus window were the first things that drew me in. Sure, the campus has its own beauty in its architecture and nature, but it's the mountains that hold the power. The town itself is a mix of charming cafes and the bustle of a downtown area, like a small town that's also got the heart of a city. The change between the two is stark, like a call to explore and find your own rhythm. There are good memories here, like late-night walks with friends or movie nights, but also tough times, like those crying sessions in the middle of the night. Yet, even in those moments, the mountains are there, steady and solid, helping me find my way forward, one step at a time. When I look up at the sunrise, they're always there, painting the sky, a symbol of strength and resilience. They're the silent guardians, the constant reminder that I can press on, no matter what life throws at me.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, finding your way won't be an issue—public transportation is easily accessible and a go-to in NYC. Bensonhurt is packed with Asian stores, a result of the neighborhood's growing Asian population over the past two decades. Every block has at least one Asian-owned business, and supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular. Locals swear by the food quality and cheaper prices at these stores. In fact, four Asian supermarkets are within walking distance of where I live, making grocery shopping a breeze. But Bensonhurt isn't solely Asian—it's diverse with immigrants and their children too. Many local businesses, even popular ones, are Asian-owned, and a recently renovated park nearby offers basketball, soccer/football, and handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain. NYC parks are always diverse, and Bensonhurt is no exception.\n\nBensonhurt doesn't have many corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-ops, condos, and two-family houses. The neighborhood is generally friendly, though it can be noisy, especially with music blasting from passing cars and constant early morning driving. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with potential for trouble from bullies and thieves. I've had my share of experiences here, including physical assault and package theft. Dog waste is a constant issue, despite NYC's fine for not cleaning up. You'll see dog waste daily as you walk to the train or supermarket. My biggest gripe? Dog waste everywhere. Keep your shoes clean and be careful!",
            "I reside in a neighborhood where sidewalks are scarce, and the terrain drops rather sharply, with my house perched at the highest point. The locals dub it the \"work out hill\" due to its popularity among joggers. Given the lack of sidewalks, everyone traverses the street, which can be a bit treacherous due to potholes and the occasional hazardous wire. The weather here is rather damp and stormy, with the trees being a constant target for lightning and debris. The neighborhood is a forest of towering evergreens, but the locals seem to have a love-hate relationship with them. They prefer to hack them down to appreciate the ocean view, resulting in many houses built high up the hill with expansive glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets are stunning when the water catches the glow from below and the sky turns a fiery orange, though it's often cloudy, and the view is often marred by a haze. Moss thrives here, coating roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month and it returned as a green, furry beast, requiring hours to clean. Children are few and far between, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is filled with retirees, and dogs often take the place of children. They're common sights in lawns or dashing down the street, sometimes sneaking into open homes. Rabbits roam freely, causing chaos in gardens, but they're a favorite for the cats. Our skies are often filled with birds, from sparrows to eagles and hawks, though they're usually chased away by the neighborhood crows. The nearest amenities are at the waterfront, where a few restaurants serve fresh seafood. The beach isn't much, but the rocky shore is a delight for throwing stones into the water. The bay is narrow, and the opposite shore is visible even through the mist.",
            "We call home a typical southern suburb nestled between two state highways, which means we get a bit more traffic than we'd prefer. But outside of that, it's a quiet neighborhood that's grown familiar over time. Most folks stick to their daily routines—yard work, chores, the occasional walk or bike ride. In winter, we make the most of the hill on our side street for sledding. Our house sits at the corner of the street, offering a prime view of the comings and goings. We're a family of four—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. We work from home, so our presence is as constant as the lawnmowers that hum day in and day out from March to October.\n\nWe've got a thing for Fall here, with trees aplenty, leaves to rake, and the aroma of burning leaves that signals the season. It's become a long Fall this year, with little winter in sight. Our garage is at the back, so we hardly use the front door unless someone rings the bell. I spend my time there working on my truck or other projects, and with the garage doors open, it feels like I'm connected to the rhythm of the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet, but Thanksgiving and the like bring extra cars and visitors from out of town. All said, I'm fond of our little slice of suburbia. If we weren't on a through street, it'd be ideal.",
            "My 'hood's smack dab in the heart of the high desert, which means dirt, dirt, and more dirt. If you've not lived here, you can't really compreh endorsing the constant brown. The only green you see belongs to those who shell out big bucks on lawn care. When I first landed here in the 90s, homes were spread out, and that's still the case today, albeit with some new additions. It's like a city's creeping in, but I suppose the same transformation's happening everywhere. Locals are generally friendly, though, like any city, there's both good and bad. In my neck of the woods, I'm surrounded by pleasant old folks, making it a cozy neighborhood. The shops here are mostly chains - Food4Less, Smart & Final, that sort. You won't find Whole Foods or similar here. The prominent jobs in town are in construction, as this city's still pretty undeveloped and wide open spaces are abundant. That bothers me; I like things just the way they are now. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and my home's got a unique charm with the different critters. People come here for the stark desert beauty, and the high desert climate creates diverse ecosystems. It's crucial for human residents to understand and respect the non-human residents to co-exist peacefully. My kids are lizard and beetle enthusiasts, and we've adapted well to the wildlife. Attractions? There's Victorville for a desert experience, and the San Bernardino County Fair's a must-visit. Plus, the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood are a winter sports lover's dream. For history buffs, check out the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When quizzed about my 'hood, I'm certain my response is a bit peculiar. While others might be homeowners with their own lives, I'm a resident of a college campus, with my dorm as my community. The surrounding campus is my neighborhood, albeit less so. Yet, my 'hood shares similarities with conventional ones - it's got houses, people, shops, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\". There's apartments (2-4 per room, 4-6 rooms per floor, 20-ish people per building), regular houses for affiliated renters, and dorms housing hundreds. Next, the people: my school's diverse makeup echoes in my 'hood. Staff, freshmen, and upperclassmen live in houses, dorms, and apartments, respectively. Moving on, my 'hood has dining options, school-branded clothing and grocery stores, and a crime-free park where everyone plays.",
            "Well, after living here for nearly a decade, I suppose I can share a bit of what I’ve learned. I must admit, I was quite sad when I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a tough transition, but my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we made the move. Our new neighborhood was considered \"not ghetto\" with better housing and a better high school, but it took time to adjust. I made new friends, but also some enemies at school. I eventually got to know our neighbors Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They've been lovely company, almost like family. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding (he re-married) and having a blast. I caught his wife's bouquet, but unfortunately missed the flowers. We danced the night away, and I enjoyed hanging out with his daughter, Marsharii. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but a GPS makes exploration enjoyable. I've only ventured as far as the park where I enjoy nature, and practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken. I also have a basketball and tennis court nearby, though it's been a while since I last played. My dad and Mr. Graves taught me tennis, and we always had fun. There's plenty of stories and moments of joy in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My hood's in close proximity to my college, which is a major plus. It's mostly apartments, but there are a few eats and pours that hit the spot and don't hit the wallet too hard. Just got a new joint down the block—it's pricier now, but quality's not too shabby. Folks are cool, they're mostly students or strapped, as the digs aren't expensive. There's a school just around the corner, so it's chock-full of kids. I'm not really chummy with the neighbors, they're into the green stuff, and the management's gone and stuck an air freshener by their door, which is pretty funny. The buildings are vintage, but they've spruced up the insides. Just down the way, there's a new development, but it's cheaply done and the rent's pricey. The school of hard knocks is just around the corner, with a no-star restaurant serving microwaved grub and a gas station that's not so hot to work at. The city's spruced up the street last year, though, with a big sidewalk, green medians, and all. The tree canopy's thick where I live, with a few stumps here and there, but it's nicer than the street behind me. The 43rd is a mess, sidewalks are falling apart, and buildings look run-down. Crime's a thing over there, but it's not just them—the complex across from me's got its share too. The transit's convenient with two stops nearby, and the uni's within stroll. Plus, the rent's affordable, so I'm good.",
            "My hood's a grid of identical duplexes, each with a yellow facade, white porch, and green metal roof, spaced out like individual houses. Most everyone here is pals with their neighbors. We chill at the end of a makeshift driveway some evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's a refreshing throwback to simpler times, with fields and trees, blue skies, and white clouds—until the recent tornado warnings. Last night, an actual siren alerted us, and I found myself in the bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my big dog stayed in the living room, nervous. The hail was massive, and the temperature dropped from 92 to 75. After the storm, the road was steaming, and a double rainbow appeared. I snapped some pics for my Facebook fam. We're a tight-knit community, but we've all got different-sized apartments. I love walking the big field behind my place and listening to the bullfrog sing in the morning. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Every morning is welcomed by rooster crows, and we've even got a donkey braying in the evening. I was fortunate to stumble upon this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I hit the ground running in this hood just as I hit the big leagues of eighth grade. Making pals wasn't easy at first, but I managed to connect with a buddy two doors down and another guy around my block. They're long gone now, but their presence is still etched in my mind. A lot of the folks who've been here since day one are still around. This neighborhood's got that classic American suburban vibe – two-story homes galore. On warmer days, the kids' laughter echoes through the streets. Most days are peaceful, and my neighbors have been nothing but cool. Once in a while, you'll hear about some unsavory incidents elsewhere, but here, we're all about keeping it real. My porch is a safe haven for packages too – never been snatched, touch wood. There's a park just a hop, skip, and a jump away. It's where I made some unforgettable memories playing ball with the locals. A few bruises and a busted nose came from it too, but the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I take the little ones from my cousin's for park visits. seeing them lose their minds on the swings triggers a wave of nostalgia. This neighborhood is a melting pot – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian eats, all within a mile. Food delivery's the new norm, but the classics like pizza and fast food are as ubiquitous as ever. The stores here are stocked with everything under the sun – dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store that's a Midwest staple. Even an Indian store popped up for a change of pace. All in all, I'm stoked to call this place home. Seeing the news and social media, you'd think the world's gone to the dogs, but my neighborhood's still got love to spare.",
            "My little town in South Carolina is nothing extraordinary, but it's got a big claim to fame in the agriculture world. It's the Peach Capital of the World, with farmland stretched out for miles, filled with peach orchards and cattle. The houses here are mostly two-story, with metal or gray shingle roofs, and they're spaced out, with plenty of room for animals and crops. The town center has a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the only shops. There's a small Chinese restaurant, a Mexican place, a burger joint, and a now-closed pizzeria. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a tiny family pharmacy known for its Cherry Coke, and there's an IGA grocery store for the basics, though many folks hit Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for more. Dollar General is the big attraction, packed from dawn till dusk. There's a long-standing furniture store run by a friendly lady, with movers to help deliver your purchase. Next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet grooming and boarding. Both the doctor's and vet's offices are a bit out of town but well-equipped. There's a single elementary school, and students head to the next town for middle and high school. The lack of parks is being addressed, with a new 2.5-acre recreational area in the works. As for entertainment, there's no movie theater or bowling alley, but it's a cozy town where you can pass right through without noticing.",
            "I first stumbled upon the story of my place while listening to a podcast about missing persons. Quite the shocker, considering every apartment in the neighborhood was listed for over a thousand bucks a month. None of my friends or I had even heard about it. Guess it's the struggle, right? A few of my pals even admitted to crying themselves to sleep at night. Expenses are through the roof, but we've gotten good at being frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty aroma of flea market trinkets and vintage clothes. Smells a lot less in adulthood, unless you're into the \"grown-up\" scent. Maybe it's the smoke, maybe it's just the state of things. But the thrift stores always draw me in. The scent of dusty magazines on a closed piano wedges itself into the leather and sticks around, even after a good wash. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but it's a different story inside the stores—silent and serene. A great spot to kill an afternoon. With each passing year, the city's only getting more crowded. Cars and people are flooding the streets, and it's all part of its growing pains. I've been living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's the friendly neighbors that make it feel like I haven't totally botched my life. I've got a knack for cleaning up after myself and leaving food for my neighbors, and they do the same in return. We take care of each other—bringing each other mail, celebrating birthdays, and mourning funerals. The pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs ensure there's always some music in the air. It's a lively place to be. I'm lucky to have a community of friendly neighbors. We treat each other well and make sure to keep our shell, and the city rolls along like waves on the beach. I've got the dusty smell of adulthood, the silent thrift stores, and the friendly neighbors to keep me company in this sprawl.",
            "My locale is a classic cookie-cutter suburbia, with a strong homeowner's association presence. Upon entering, you'll see pristine single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's vigilant maintenance. The front yards are uniform, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, often featuring small trees. Every house has a two-car garage, and the streets are immaculately paved. There are no individual mailboxes; instead, everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox in a large grouping at the end of the street, with two larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is a blend of rural and suburban, with plenty of land for community pools and walking trails. Most residents are retired, with a sprinkling of middle-aged and young professionals. The city is surprisingly populous but has a small-town vibe. Amenities abound, including a mall that caters to organic food lovers and bargain hunters alike. It takes about 15 minutes to reach significant attractions, but once there, you'll find a wide range of stores. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained area with plenty of nice things like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to major shopping, it's easily accessible by car.",
            "I call the small Midwestern town where I dwell my home, but it's a place that's just outside the urban sprawl of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, nestled on the east side of town, is the most economically challenged area. It's a low-value neighborhood, with most homes rented or owned by those on limited incomes. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place to live. The neighbors are quite friendly, offering warm smiles and hellos as I stroll down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher, are still relatively low. We've had our share of violent incidents, like a few shootings and a homicide in the past decade within a few blocks. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family hasn't been directly impacted, aside from the occasional porch theft. Our town has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic, with many lives claimed by fentanyl overdoses. But we've got resources to combat this, including rehab centers and Narcan training for families and friends. Despite these challenges, there are plenty of positives. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with great staff who've ensured he hasn't faced any bullying. We have an active PTO planning annual events, and the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students. The town council has made improvements, but these are mainly in the city center and the west side, where most shopping and traffic are. The east side, where I live, often feels neglected. Yet, we love our home; it's comfortable and adequate. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hub nestled on a hill, surrounded by historic structures. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and just a block away, there's this awesome arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Lines often form, especially on weekends in June and July. A few blocks up, we have our city park, quite large for the area. Concrete walls surround it, with tall steps leading up. During winter, homeless folks set up tents in rows along the sidewalk and steps, huddled together for warmth. Rain, not snow, is our harsh winter visitor, making it tough to stay warm. Their tents are close to the family center for miles around, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my neighborhood isn't the historic buildings or the architecture, but the spirit of its people. Once infamous for gang violence, the Hilltop still bears its past, and stories are passed down generation to generation. People work hard to maintain it, and they care deeply about their community. You're warned not to walk around after dark if you're white, a reminder of old days and social conditioning. I'm dark enough to get by, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, aware of the reminders of racism and fear. No matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who offer help without asking for something in return. It's a place where laundromat owners extend their hours to let me charge my phone when caught in the rain. It's a place where I've felt invisible, huddled against storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop and give me a $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I hail from the heart of rural America, smack dab in the middle of small-town Michigan. From here, you're a stone's throw from miles of farmland and quaint tourist destinations, but you won't find any big city amenities. No sprawling malls, no Wal-mart or Target, not even an Applebee’s nearby. To get anywhere, you've got to hop in the car. Despite the drive, I live in one of the most breathtaking spots on earth, surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every direction you turn, there's a beach waiting for your toes. My 'city' is a quintessential small town. Houses aren't stacked like towers, but rather spaced out. They're unique, not cookie-cutter, and often feature older aluminum siding. Some are updated, others are time-worn, but all have full basements visible from the road. Most homes have yards, with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for the occasional animal. The houses are a snapshot of Middle America - hardworking folks raising families or having raised them. Kids run up and down the streets, people walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors know each other, and you can spot the outsiders. You'll hear grilling outside and pleasant smiles from passersby. The lawns are well-maintained, with no leaves from last fall and green grass under control. This isn't a fancy neighborhood, but it's perfect for families. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While average-looking, it's exceptional for what it represents - a place where people can feel safe and secure. Just around the corner, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department, the city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, and a small airport. You can hear the hum of small planes taking off and landing while playing outside or inside. A leisurely bike ride or walk to the local ice cream shop is no problem, and even the park is just a short distance away. It's a fantastic place to call home, really."
