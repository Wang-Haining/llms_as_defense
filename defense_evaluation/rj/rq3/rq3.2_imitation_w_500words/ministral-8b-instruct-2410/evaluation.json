            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

The unofficial motto, emblazoned on the back of a pizza and bar and venue and strip club (yeah, you read that right) is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some folks see it as a nod to a past Portland, less known, less expensive, brimming with creative and unique subcultures. Others see it as a call to action, an invitation to embrace the weird and be weird, if you will. And even with the influx of California transplants and their condos, Portland's weirdness remains intact. Now, weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it does mean we're accepting of the unexpected. We've got our modern conveniences and our modern gripes, like the rest of the country, we buy most of our stuff from China. There's a million ways to be weird, to not fit the mold, but Portland's got plenty of normal too. There's yoga and hipsters and suits. Maybe weird means we just don't take it all so seriously.

            "The mountains stand steadfast, north of where I live, greeting the sunrise and sunset daily. They are unyielding, even when my mind is elsewhere, lost in the whirlwind of work and life. When I'm most stressed or anxious, they call to me, offering respite and strength. I moved here for undergrad, and the mountains were what first captivated me. Sure, the campus has its own beauty with its buildings, ponds, and trees, but it's the mountains that command my attention. The rest of the town is charming, with beautiful cafes and a downtown area that bustles with energy, only to give way to the calm of the small-town vibe. The contrast of these atmospheres makes this city feel like an adventure waiting to be explored, filled with cherished memories like late-night walks past the rusted swings in the park or downtown runs to catch a movie. But it also holds harsh memories, as all places do. The ponds can be a place for reflection and tears, especially after an existential crisis. Watching the creatures living their lives can make one ponder their own purpose. One day, I realized I was walking north, towards the sunrise, and there they were. The mountains, as solid and strong as ever, adorned the sky, reminding me of my resilience.",

The trees, while beautiful, are often targeted for removal due to the view obstruction they cause. The houses here are built high up on the hill, with big glass windows to catch the ocean view. The weather is damp and overcast most days, with moss growing on everything, including my car, which turned green and furry in a month. There aren't many kids around, but there are plenty of dogs and wild rabbits, which my cats love to chase. The bay isn't wide, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. There are a few restaurants down the hill that serve fresh seafood, but not many stores. The view of the opposite shoreline is clear on most days, though the mist can be thick.",
            "I call home a typical suburban area in a small southern town nestled in Tennessee. Perched between two state highways, we've got more than our fair share of traffic, but other than that, it's a quiet, peaceful neighborhood. Folks around here are mainly content with their yard work and daily chores. Come winter, we make the most of the hills nearby for some good old-fashioned sledding. Our home's at the front corner of the street, so we're always in the loop with the comings and goings. We're a tight-knit crew, familiar with the cars and vehicles that frequent our streets. Whenever a new one appears, we take notice. Our neighbors like to walk for exercise or to walk their dogs, while the kids are always out on their bikes. We're a close-knit family, my wife and I, along with our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. We work from home, so we're well-known by the locals. We enjoy playing outside, even in the rain, and a barbecue on the back deck is always a hit. From March through October, you can't miss the steady hum of lawn mowers. Our neighborhood is filled with trees, a remnant of its past wooded glory, which means plenty of shade and a yearly leaf ritual in the fall. I'm partial to the smell of burning leaves, a sure sign of the changing season. Lately, winter has been a no-show, so it's felt more like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back, so the front door sees little use unless someone knocks, which isn't often. I enjoy tinkering with my truck and other projects in the garage, feeling more connected to the neighborhood when the doors are open. Holidays here are quiet affairs, with Thanksgiving and other holidays seeing a few extra cars parked along the street. All in all, I'm quite content with our little corner of the world. If it weren't a through street, it'd be perfect.",
            "My hood's smack dab in the high desert, where dirt is king, and when you do spot a lawn, you know someone's pouring cash into it. When I first landed here in the 90s, the houses were few and far between. Now, it's the same deal, but with a bunch of new additions. It's starting to look more city-like, I guess. Most folks are friendly, but like any city, it's got its ups and downs. I'm surrounded by nice old folks, so it's a pretty sweet neighborhood. The stores here are mostly chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. For upscale, you've got to travel, as I've never seen Whole Foods or the like. The city's job scene is construction-heavy, probably because it's still not that developed. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, so I'm right in the middle of it. What I love about my home is the critters. People flock here for the desert's stark beauty, and the kids and I are all about the lizards and desert bugs. As for attractions, Victorville's a solid spot for families, especially with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. Or, hit up the snow-covered peaks in nearby Wrightwood and take some winter sports lessons. If you're into natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum's got you covered with geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and more.",
            "When asked to describe my 'hood, I reckon my response is a bit off the beaten path. While others are likely to talk about their own homes and lives, I've got a different story. My 'hood is the college campus I call home, with my dorm mates as my community. The campus itself is my 'hood too, albeit less so. Despite this quirk, my 'hood has some feel-good stuff in common with regular neighborhoods. Just like any other, it's got houses, folks, shops, and parks. Let's dive into the 'houses' of my 'hood. There are three main types of housing in my area: apartments, actual houses, and dorms. Apartments usually fit 2-4 folks per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people per building. Actual houses are 2-4 bedroom setups for affiliated school alumni, but they're fewer in number. Dorms? That's where most of the students live, with two per room and thousands of students in those big buildings. Moving on to the people, my school's all about diversity, and it shows in my 'hood. Staff live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. It's hard to do the folks of my 'hood justice just by talking about them, so let's move on to the shops and parks. Since my school is basically its own town, there's a ton of stores and one park. The stores are a mix of dining spots and school-branded shops. The park? It's a playground for the diverse bunch in my 'hood, kept clean and safe by everyone.",
            "Well, since I've been living here for about 10 years now, I can share some insights. When I first arrived, I was pretty bummed to leave Riverdale for Stockbridge. I cried on my way here, missing my old neighborhood and friends, but my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved. Our new neighborhood was considered \"not ghetto,\" and I eventually got used to it, making new friends and getting to know some of our neighbors. I spent time with Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis for a bit. They became like family to me, and I'm always looking forward to special events like Mr. Glen's wedding, where I caught the wife's little white strap. We danced and had a blast, especially with Marsharii, one of their daughters. It's been a while since I've seen her, though, but I hope she's doing great.\n\nThe neighborhood itself feels like a maze, but with my GPS, it's easier to explore. I've only made it so far, hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games, and enjoying nature. I also enjoy practicing my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bringing my bokken wooden sword. We used to play tennis and basketball too, with my dad and Mr. Graves pushing us hard but having fun. There's plenty of stories from my time here, but these are the ones that stand out. I'm looking forward to more adventures and fun in the future!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, so living here suits me just fine. Mostly, it's a mix of apartment buildings and a few cool, reasonably priced eateries and watering holes. One of the bars just got a new name, and while it's pricier now, the service and drinks are still solid. The people here are generally friendly, either fellow students or those on a budget due to the affordable housing. With an elementary school nearby, there are plenty of kids around. My neighbors? I don't really know them and I'm not sure I want to, especially since they seem to enjoy a bit too much weed. The management stuck an air freshener by their door to combat the smell, which was amusing. The buildings are a mix of old and new, with a few recent constructions that don't seem well-built. One area has a nice big sidewalk and a lot of greenery, but the apartments there are cheaply constructed and expensively rented out. There's a restaurant nearby that serves microwaved food on paper plates and a gas station that's not the best place to work. However, the street where I live has plenty of trees, and while a few have been cut down, there are still more trees than down the road. Behind my building, there's a tree line and another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd Street, but right behind me is 43rd Street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape and the buildings look run-down, with a lot of trees hiding the poor condition. There's been some crime at an apartment complex nearby, but no point in singling them out just because of that. There are also a lot of transient residents in the apartments across the street. Overall, I like where I live because it's affordable and conveniently located near the university and two bus stops.",
            "My 'hood is filled with duplexes on a cul-de-sac, each painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs, making them look like individual homes. We all get along, though not everyone is friends. We gather at the end of our driveway some evenings, chatting as kids play with their toys or fly kites. It's a refreshing break from our tech-filled world. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds. This is my small-town heaven, but there's a downside: tornado warnings. Last night, I heard the sirens and ended up in my bathtub with my purse and pillows, clutching my little dog. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought heavy hail and a sudden temperature drop. After the storm, the road was steaming, and I saw a double rainbow. I snapped photos to share with my Facebook friends. The streets were quiet for an hour before people started coming home. Then it was back to normal, with kids playing and moms cooking dinner. I love the southern accent and my two-bedroom, two-bath apartment. The neighborhood is a hidden gem, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by rooster crows and in the evening, a donkey braying from a nearby farm. I was lucky to find this charming neighborhood.",
            "I rolled into this hood just as I was about to hit eighth grade. It was tough at first to connect with locals, but eventually, I hooked up with two guys, one two houses down and another on my block. They've since moved on, but the memories linger. The original cast of characters is still here for the most part. My 'hood is your typical American suburban vibe—lots of two-story homes, weekend chatter, and mostly quiet weekdays. I've never had a beef with my neighbors. They keep to themselves, except when you need help. I've had numerous packages delivered, none snatched. I trust these folks. There's a park a couple of minutes away with a ton of good and bad memories. I've played ball there with the locals, and while I've got a nose injury to remember, the good times far outweigh the bad. Now, it's a place for my cousin's kids who are way younger than me. The park's nostalgia factor is off the charts. The neighborhood's diverse, with every cuisine you could want nearby. GrubHub and DoorDash are the go-to for food delivery these days, but there's always a pizza joint around. Stores have everything you need, from dry cleaners to Walgreens, CVS, and even an Indian-owned spot for some South Asian fare. It's a pretty great place, really. Reading about other folks' horror stories on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine all the more.",
            "Nestled in the heart of South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming little town that blends seamlessly with others in the state, but it's especially distinguished for its agricultural prowess. Johnston is affectionately dubbed the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title that's proudly displayed at the town's welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by sprawling farmlands, a patchwork of peach orchards and cattle pastures. Houses outside the town center are scattered, typically two-story structures with metal roofs to guard against the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes often sit further back from the road, allowing the front fields to serve as grazing or planting grounds. The town's central hub is marked by a solitary four-way stop light, where the sole retail establishments reside. There's your typical fast food fare—Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A former pizza joint has since closed, but Maxwell and Halford Drug, a quaint family-owned pharmacy, still stands, known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Shoppers can also pop into Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, the only grocery store, though many prefer the convenience of a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The Dollar General store is a local favorite, bustling from morning till night with an array of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, a longstanding fixture, is run by a kind woman who employs two movers for delivery. Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Away from the town center, there’s a modest elementary school and veterinary practice, but for entertainment, the pickings are lean. No movie theaters, bowling alleys, or parks, but there are plans afoot for a 2.5-acre recreational area to boost outdoor fun and attract residents. Despite the limited offerings, it's a sweet, quiet town where you can breeze right through without notice!",
            "The first time I stumbled upon the story of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was unexpected to hear that nearly every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends had heard about this, and I guess it's just the struggle we're all dealing with. Many of my friends find themselves struggling to make ends meet and can't get a good night's sleep. Things are expensive, but we've learned to make the most of what we have. You start to appreciate the nostalgic smell of old flea market toys and second-hand clothes. The smell of adulthood is like dust collecting on closed-up books and the scent of old leather. There are three thrift stores nearby, and if you start on the far side, you can pop into two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but you'd never know it in the thrift stores. Despite the constant flow of people and vehicles, the stores are always quiet. It's a cozy place to while away an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more people and cars. It's a developing city, they say, with one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York. Everyone here has their own goals, and no one really asks anything from you. You can be alone, keep to yourself, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where being caring means you care too much. Here, you can keep your distance, and the city will carry on like waves on the beach. It's a vibrant place to live. With the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something happening. It's like we're not just neighbors, but a community of friends. We help each other out with our needs, celebrate together, mourn together, and support each other when we can. I feel lucky to be here. Most of my neighbors are pretty cool, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, which they return the favor with. We share our mail and enjoy each other's company. I live in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't mess up my life completely.",
            "The area where I live has that classic cookie-cutter suburban vibe, with a strong presence of a homeowner's association. Walking in, you'll find a sea of pristine single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's diligent maintenance. The front yards are all alike, with a small patch of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot a small tree. Every home has a two-car garage. As you drive through, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in excellent condition, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, but you'll sometimes see two-story homes as well. Unlike traditional single-family homes, we don't have individual mailboxes; instead, there's a large cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, accessible via a key system. There are also larger lockers for packages. The HOA's attention to uniformity is evident here too. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, making my neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban living. We have plenty of open space, including multiple community pools and walking trails. These are well-maintained and gated, offering a great place to exercise or just take an evening stroll. Most of the residents are retired, with a sprinkling of middle-aged and young professionals. The city is surprisingly large by population but has a cozy small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, like a single mall that's not huge but functional. It takes around 15 minutes to reach it, and it's stocked with various stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets with a minimal staff. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard. We have pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next to any major shopping hubs, it's just a short drive away from all the big-name chains you could want.",
            "I reside in a small town situated right on the cusp of a major metro area's suburbs. In the eastern part of town, where I call home, you'll find the most economically challenged neighborhood. Most homes here are either rented by or owned by those with low incomes, but the area is far from unpleasant. Neighbors are generally warm, offering a friendly \"hello\" if you're out for a stroll. While crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of town, they're still quite low. A few violent incidents, like shootings and even a homicide, have occurred nearby in the past decade. Our neighbors sadly lost their son in a bar shooting last year. Our family has been fortunate enough to avoid direct crime, though we've had the occasional item vanish from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. The opioid epidemic has taken a toll on our town; many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are various resources in place to combat this, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions. Despite these challenges, the town offers several positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support crew. With special needs, he hasn't faced any bullying due to the school's positive atmosphere, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO planning multiple events throughout the year to engage families and foster educational growth. With over 20% of our town's population living below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is seen as less because of their financial status, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are quite reasonable. The City Council has made improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and city park refurbishments. Most of these improvements have been made in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are concentrated and traffic is heavy. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a source of frustration for residents here. Nevertheless, I enjoy living in this town. The people are friendly, the schools are great, there's plenty of shopping options to meet our family's needs, and our home, though not worth much, is comfortable and adequate. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My hood is packed with culture, nestled on a hill, with buildings that tell stories through their architecture. I'm in a 7-story apartment across from a historic theater, and a block down, there's this rad arcade bar that draws a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Lines form on weekends in June and July, especially for this place. Not far, there's a big city park with concrete steps leading up to it. In the cold months, you'll find homeless folks setting up tents in neat rows, keeping warm and close to the family center for showers and meals. My city's charm isn't in the grand old buildings or the historic vibes; it's in the people. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence, and even today, whispers of those times echo through the generations. The folks here work hard to clean up, even if it's still considered one of the tougher 'hoods. They care about their city, their block. There's a warning that white people shouldn't walk around at night, but I feel right at home here, meeting people who've shown me kindness. I've had strangers offer me their jackets or money, and I've felt alive walking these streets. Laundry owners stayed open late to help me charge my phone, and on the greyest nights, I've found myself invisible, yet valued, with someone stopping to hand me cash and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable. This place, it's not perfect, but it's mine, and it feels alive.",
            "In the heart of Rural America, more specifically, small-town Michigan, the landscape shifts from sprawling farmland to tiny tourist havens. The nearest big-box stores or chain restaurants are all a drive away. Yet, I reside in one of the most breathtaking spots on Earth, with Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering beaches at every turn.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town living. Homes aren't stacked high but rather spread out, each unique. Some are newly updated, while others hold a quaint, vintage charm. Many have full basements visible from the road, and aluminum siding is a common sight. Houses come in an array of colors, reflecting the individuality of their owners. Many homes boast trampolines, playsets, and even gardens or animal pens. It’s the epitome of Middle America: hardworking folks raising families or already having raised them.\n\nNeighbors are familiar faces, and you can sense who fits in and who doesn’t. A friendly wave or smile is common, especially during barbecues or walks with the dog. Lawns are well-kept, green, and tidy, reflecting a sense of pride and community.\n\nWhile not a picture-perfect neighborhood, it possesses an understated beauty. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe—a haven where people yearn to live. Nearby, the county sheriff’s department and jail stand as a beacon of safety, while the health department and recycling center serve the community. Sports fields and an airport add to the tranquility, with the rumbles of small planes occasionally breaking the silence. A walk to the local ice cream shop or a bike ride to the park are common activities. Our small town airport is a short distance away, and my kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only 8 blocks away. It truly is a great place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

There's a public school that's been here for almost a century, stirring up nostalgia in the elders and hope in the youth.

The houses are predominantly brick and stucco, each boasting at least a half acre of land meticulously maintained. During springtime, an abundance of annual flowers and Midwestern trees paint the landscape. Driveways gleam with high-end Mercedes Benzes fresh from a car wash. As we approach my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor, always cheerful, is outside tending to his lawn. His humming over the mower's noise has become a neighborhood staple. He used to be a doctor, blending in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you'll reach my home. Geese abound in the side yard, chased by our Terrier. A stream feeds into the quarry, where bullfrogs croak and the occasional “moo” resonates from nearby farms. A wooden bridge leads to an untouched oasis filled with native trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood playground, from building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals, there was always something to do and a neighborhood companion to join. Winter in my small town can be harsh, but there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms into a frozen wilderness. Trees shed vibrant autumn colors to become skeletal branches. Snowfall creates a winter wonderland, with my sister's snow angels and snowmen lining the backyard. We'd build igloo-like forts, stocked with branches, for our snowball wars. In our own winter wonderland, we played pretend, lost in a world where nothing else mattered.",
            "First off, let me just drop some knowledge: Portland, Oregon is just about the weirdest town you'll ever meet. The unofficial motto, emblazoned on the back of a pizza and bar and venue and strip club (yeah, you read that right) is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some folks see it as a nod to a past Portland, less known, less expensive, brimming with creative and unique subcultures. Others see it as a call to action, an invitation to embrace the weird and be weird, if you will. And even with the influx of California transplants and their condos, Portland's weirdness remains intact. Now, weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it does mean we're accepting of the unexpected. We've got our modern conveniences and our modern gripes, like the rest of the country, we buy most of our stuff from China. There's a million ways to be weird, to not fit the mold, but Portland's got plenty of normal too. There's yoga and hipsters and suits. Maybe weird means we just don't take it all so seriously. In my hood, and many Portland hoods, you'll find colorful houses, home gardens, and free boxes. These aren't your average cardboard boxes, folks. They contain treasures, clothes, books, anything you need. The magical potential of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland's all about, to me at least. But Portland's about more than free boxes and colorful houses. Portland's got goat yoga, Timbers matches, people who love their dreams and their bars. And yes, Portland's got a drug problem, which is often linked to mental health issues, and the constant rain and clouds don't help. Portland's also got a homelessness problem, more services than most places, but still not enough. We're a mix of care and hatred, and in that, Portland's not weird at all. It's just Portland.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast, north of where I live, greeting the sunrise and sunset daily. They are unyielding, even when my mind is elsewhere, lost in the whirlwind of work and life. When I'm most stressed or anxious, they call to me, offering respite and strength. I moved here for undergrad, and the mountains were what first captivated me. Sure, the campus has its own beauty with its buildings, ponds, and trees, but it's the mountains that command my attention. The rest of the town is charming, with beautiful cafes and a downtown area that bustles with energy, only to give way to the calm of the small-town vibe. The contrast of these atmospheres makes this city feel like an adventure waiting to be explored, filled with cherished memories like late-night walks past the rusted swings in the park or downtown runs to catch a movie. But it also holds harsh memories, as all places do. The ponds can be a place for reflection and tears, especially after an existential crisis. Watching the creatures living their lives can make one ponder their own purpose. One day, I realized I was walking north, towards the sunrise, and there they were. The mountains, as solid and strong as ever, adorned the sky, reminding me of my resilience.",
            "If you're planning to swing by Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding your way. It's got great public transit, which is a staple in NYC. Bensonhurst is right in the city's heart, with plenty of Asian-owned stores, especially supermarkets and laundromats, which are popular among locals for their quality, low prices, and convenience. We've got four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other! It's not just Asian, though; it's diverse with immigrants and their kids too. More corporate buildings? Nah, mostly co-ops, condos, and two-family houses. Oh, and noise? It's there. Cars blasting music, morning traffic, you name it. Nighttime? Be cautious, some unpredictable folks around. I've seen my fair share of trouble here, but that was years ago. Packets? They get stolen sometimes. And dog waste? It's a morning routine. Keep your shoes clean!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live, so everyone walks on the road, which can feel a bit dangerous with its potholes and the tattered wires dangling overhead. The trees, while beautiful, are often targeted for removal due to the view obstruction they cause. The houses here are built high up on the hill, with big glass windows to catch the ocean view. The weather is damp and overcast most days, with moss growing on everything, including my car, which turned green and furry in a month. There aren't many kids around, but there are plenty of dogs and wild rabbits, which my cats love to chase. The bay isn't wide, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. There are a few restaurants down the hill that serve fresh seafood, but not many stores. The view of the opposite shoreline is clear on most days, though the mist can be thick.",
            "I call home a typical suburban area in a small southern town nestled in Tennessee. Perched between two state highways, we've got more than our fair share of traffic, but other than that, it's a quiet, peaceful neighborhood. Folks around here are mainly content with their yard work and daily chores. Come winter, we make the most of the hills nearby for some good old-fashioned sledding. Our home's at the front corner of the street, so we're always in the loop with the comings and goings. We're a tight-knit crew, familiar with the cars and vehicles that frequent our streets. Whenever a new one appears, we take notice. Our neighbors like to walk for exercise or to walk their dogs, while the kids are always out on their bikes. We're a close-knit family, my wife and I, along with our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. We work from home, so we're well-known by the locals. We enjoy playing outside, even in the rain, and a barbecue on the back deck is always a hit. From March through October, you can't miss the steady hum of lawn mowers. Our neighborhood is filled with trees, a remnant of its past wooded glory, which means plenty of shade and a yearly leaf ritual in the fall. I'm partial to the smell of burning leaves, a sure sign of the changing season. Lately, winter has been a no-show, so it's felt more like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back, so the front door sees little use unless someone knocks, which isn't often. I enjoy tinkering with my truck and other projects in the garage, feeling more connected to the neighborhood when the doors are open. Holidays here are quiet affairs, with Thanksgiving and other holidays seeing a few extra cars parked along the street. All in all, I'm quite content with our little corner of the world. If it weren't a through street, it'd be perfect.",
            "My hood's smack dab in the high desert, where dirt is king, and when you do spot a lawn, you know someone's pouring cash into it. When I first landed here in the 90s, the houses were few and far between. Now, it's the same deal, but with a bunch of new additions. It's starting to look more city-like, I guess. Most folks are friendly, but like any city, it's got its ups and downs. I'm surrounded by nice old folks, so it's a pretty sweet neighborhood. The stores here are mostly chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. For upscale, you've got to travel, as I've never seen Whole Foods or the like. The city's job scene is construction-heavy, probably because it's still not that developed. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, so I'm right in the middle of it. What I love about my home is the critters. People flock here for the desert's stark beauty, and the kids and I are all about the lizards and desert bugs. As for attractions, Victorville's a solid spot for families, especially with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. Or, hit up the snow-covered peaks in nearby Wrightwood and take some winter sports lessons. If you're into natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum's got you covered with geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and more.",
            "When asked to describe my 'hood, I reckon my response is a bit off the beaten path. While others are likely to talk about their own homes and lives, I've got a different story. My 'hood is the college campus I call home, with my dorm mates as my community. The campus itself is my 'hood too, albeit less so. Despite this quirk, my 'hood has some feel-good stuff in common with regular neighborhoods. Just like any other, it's got houses, folks, shops, and parks. Let's dive into the 'houses' of my 'hood. There are three main types of housing in my area: apartments, actual houses, and dorms. Apartments usually fit 2-4 folks per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people per building. Actual houses are 2-4 bedroom setups for affiliated school alumni, but they're fewer in number. Dorms? That's where most of the students live, with two per room and thousands of students in those big buildings. Moving on to the people, my school's all about diversity, and it shows in my 'hood. Staff live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. It's hard to do the folks of my 'hood justice just by talking about them, so let's move on to the shops and parks. Since my school is basically its own town, there's a ton of stores and one park. The stores are a mix of dining spots and school-branded shops. The park? It's a playground for the diverse bunch in my 'hood, kept clean and safe by everyone.",
            "Well, since I've been living here for about 10 years now, I can share some insights. When I first arrived, I was pretty bummed to leave Riverdale for Stockbridge. I cried on my way here, missing my old neighborhood and friends, but my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved. Our new neighborhood was considered \"not ghetto,\" and I eventually got used to it, making new friends and getting to know some of our neighbors. I spent time with Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis for a bit. They became like family to me, and I'm always looking forward to special events like Mr. Glen's wedding, where I caught the wife's little white strap. We danced and had a blast, especially with Marsharii, one of their daughters. It's been a while since I've seen her, though, but I hope she's doing great.\n\nThe neighborhood itself feels like a maze, but with my GPS, it's easier to explore. I've only made it so far, hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games, and enjoying nature. I also enjoy practicing my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bringing my bokken wooden sword. We used to play tennis and basketball too, with my dad and Mr. Graves pushing us hard but having fun. There's plenty of stories from my time here, but these are the ones that stand out. I'm looking forward to more adventures and fun in the future!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, so living here suits me just fine. Mostly, it's a mix of apartment buildings and a few cool, reasonably priced eateries and watering holes. One of the bars just got a new name, and while it's pricier now, the service and drinks are still solid. The people here are generally friendly, either fellow students or those on a budget due to the affordable housing. With an elementary school nearby, there are plenty of kids around. My neighbors? I don't really know them and I'm not sure I want to, especially since they seem to enjoy a bit too much weed. The management stuck an air freshener by their door to combat the smell, which was amusing. The buildings are a mix of old and new, with a few recent constructions that don't seem well-built. One area has a nice big sidewalk and a lot of greenery, but the apartments there are cheaply constructed and expensively rented out. There's a restaurant nearby that serves microwaved food on paper plates and a gas station that's not the best place to work. However, the street where I live has plenty of trees, and while a few have been cut down, there are still more trees than down the road. Behind my building, there's a tree line and another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd Street, but right behind me is 43rd Street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape and the buildings look run-down, with a lot of trees hiding the poor condition. There's been some crime at an apartment complex nearby, but no point in singling them out just because of that. There are also a lot of transient residents in the apartments across the street. Overall, I like where I live because it's affordable and conveniently located near the university and two bus stops.",
            "My 'hood is filled with duplexes on a cul-de-sac, each painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs, making them look like individual homes. We all get along, though not everyone is friends. We gather at the end of our driveway some evenings, chatting as kids play with their toys or fly kites. It's a refreshing break from our tech-filled world. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds. This is my small-town heaven, but there's a downside: tornado warnings. Last night, I heard the sirens and ended up in my bathtub with my purse and pillows, clutching my little dog. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought heavy hail and a sudden temperature drop. After the storm, the road was steaming, and I saw a double rainbow. I snapped photos to share with my Facebook friends. The streets were quiet for an hour before people started coming home. Then it was back to normal, with kids playing and moms cooking dinner. I love the southern accent and my two-bedroom, two-bath apartment. The neighborhood is a hidden gem, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by rooster crows and in the evening, a donkey braying from a nearby farm. I was lucky to find this charming neighborhood.",
            "I rolled into this hood just as I was about to hit eighth grade. It was tough at first to connect with locals, but eventually, I hooked up with two guys, one two houses down and another on my block. They've since moved on, but the memories linger. The original cast of characters is still here for the most part. My 'hood is your typical American suburban vibe—lots of two-story homes, weekend chatter, and mostly quiet weekdays. I've never had a beef with my neighbors. They keep to themselves, except when you need help. I've had numerous packages delivered, none snatched. I trust these folks. There's a park a couple of minutes away with a ton of good and bad memories. I've played ball there with the locals, and while I've got a nose injury to remember, the good times far outweigh the bad. Now, it's a place for my cousin's kids who are way younger than me. The park's nostalgia factor is off the charts. The neighborhood's diverse, with every cuisine you could want nearby. GrubHub and DoorDash are the go-to for food delivery these days, but there's always a pizza joint around. Stores have everything you need, from dry cleaners to Walgreens, CVS, and even an Indian-owned spot for some South Asian fare. It's a pretty great place, really. Reading about other folks' horror stories on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine all the more.",
            "Nestled in the heart of South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming little town that blends seamlessly with others in the state, but it's especially distinguished for its agricultural prowess. Johnston is affectionately dubbed the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title that's proudly displayed at the town's welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by sprawling farmlands, a patchwork of peach orchards and cattle pastures. Houses outside the town center are scattered, typically two-story structures with metal roofs to guard against the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes often sit further back from the road, allowing the front fields to serve as grazing or planting grounds. The town's central hub is marked by a solitary four-way stop light, where the sole retail establishments reside. There's your typical fast food fare—Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A former pizza joint has since closed, but Maxwell and Halford Drug, a quaint family-owned pharmacy, still stands, known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Shoppers can also pop into Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, the only grocery store, though many prefer the convenience of a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The Dollar General store is a local favorite, bustling from morning till night with an array of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, a longstanding fixture, is run by a kind woman who employs two movers for delivery. Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Away from the town center, there’s a modest elementary school and veterinary practice, but for entertainment, the pickings are lean. No movie theaters, bowling alleys, or parks, but there are plans afoot for a 2.5-acre recreational area to boost outdoor fun and attract residents. Despite the limited offerings, it's a sweet, quiet town where you can breeze right through without notice!",
            "The first time I stumbled upon the story of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was unexpected to hear that nearly every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends had heard about this, and I guess it's just the struggle we're all dealing with. Many of my friends find themselves struggling to make ends meet and can't get a good night's sleep. Things are expensive, but we've learned to make the most of what we have. You start to appreciate the nostalgic smell of old flea market toys and second-hand clothes. The smell of adulthood is like dust collecting on closed-up books and the scent of old leather. There are three thrift stores nearby, and if you start on the far side, you can pop into two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but you'd never know it in the thrift stores. Despite the constant flow of people and vehicles, the stores are always quiet. It's a cozy place to while away an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more people and cars. It's a developing city, they say, with one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York. Everyone here has their own goals, and no one really asks anything from you. You can be alone, keep to yourself, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where being caring means you care too much. Here, you can keep your distance, and the city will carry on like waves on the beach. It's a vibrant place to live. With the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something happening. It's like we're not just neighbors, but a community of friends. We help each other out with our needs, celebrate together, mourn together, and support each other when we can. I feel lucky to be here. Most of my neighbors are pretty cool, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, which they return the favor with. We share our mail and enjoy each other's company. I live in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't mess up my life completely.",
            "The area where I live has that classic cookie-cutter suburban vibe, with a strong presence of a homeowner's association. Walking in, you'll find a sea of pristine single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's diligent maintenance. The front yards are all alike, with a small patch of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot a small tree. Every home has a two-car garage. As you drive through, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in excellent condition, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, but you'll sometimes see two-story homes as well. Unlike traditional single-family homes, we don't have individual mailboxes; instead, there's a large cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, accessible via a key system. There are also larger lockers for packages. The HOA's attention to uniformity is evident here too. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, making my neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban living. We have plenty of open space, including multiple community pools and walking trails. These are well-maintained and gated, offering a great place to exercise or just take an evening stroll. Most of the residents are retired, with a sprinkling of middle-aged and young professionals. The city is surprisingly large by population but has a cozy small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, like a single mall that's not huge but functional. It takes around 15 minutes to reach it, and it's stocked with various stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets with a minimal staff. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard. We have pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next to any major shopping hubs, it's just a short drive away from all the big-name chains you could want.",
            "I reside in a small town situated right on the cusp of a major metro area's suburbs. In the eastern part of town, where I call home, you'll find the most economically challenged neighborhood. Most homes here are either rented by or owned by those with low incomes, but the area is far from unpleasant. Neighbors are generally warm, offering a friendly \"hello\" if you're out for a stroll. While crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of town, they're still quite low. A few violent incidents, like shootings and even a homicide, have occurred nearby in the past decade. Our neighbors sadly lost their son in a bar shooting last year. Our family has been fortunate enough to avoid direct crime, though we've had the occasional item vanish from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. The opioid epidemic has taken a toll on our town; many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are various resources in place to combat this, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions. Despite these challenges, the town offers several positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support crew. With special needs, he hasn't faced any bullying due to the school's positive atmosphere, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO planning multiple events throughout the year to engage families and foster educational growth. With over 20% of our town's population living below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is seen as less because of their financial status, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are quite reasonable. The City Council has made improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and city park refurbishments. Most of these improvements have been made in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are concentrated and traffic is heavy. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a source of frustration for residents here. Nevertheless, I enjoy living in this town. The people are friendly, the schools are great, there's plenty of shopping options to meet our family's needs, and our home, though not worth much, is comfortable and adequate. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My hood is packed with culture, nestled on a hill, with buildings that tell stories through their architecture. I'm in a 7-story apartment across from a historic theater, and a block down, there's this rad arcade bar that draws a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Lines form on weekends in June and July, especially for this place. Not far, there's a big city park with concrete steps leading up to it. In the cold months, you'll find homeless folks setting up tents in neat rows, keeping warm and close to the family center for showers and meals. My city's charm isn't in the grand old buildings or the historic vibes; it's in the people. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence, and even today, whispers of those times echo through the generations. The folks here work hard to clean up, even if it's still considered one of the tougher 'hoods. They care about their city, their block. There's a warning that white people shouldn't walk around at night, but I feel right at home here, meeting people who've shown me kindness. I've had strangers offer me their jackets or money, and I've felt alive walking these streets. Laundry owners stayed open late to help me charge my phone, and on the greyest nights, I've found myself invisible, yet valued, with someone stopping to hand me cash and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable. This place, it's not perfect, but it's mine, and it feels alive.",
            "In the heart of Rural America, more specifically, small-town Michigan, the landscape shifts from sprawling farmland to tiny tourist havens. The nearest big-box stores or chain restaurants are all a drive away. Yet, I reside in one of the most breathtaking spots on Earth, with Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering beaches at every turn.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town living. Homes aren't stacked high but rather spread out, each unique. Some are newly updated, while others hold a quaint, vintage charm. Many have full basements visible from the road, and aluminum siding is a common sight. Houses come in an array of colors, reflecting the individuality of their owners. Many homes boast trampolines, playsets, and even gardens or animal pens. It’s the epitome of Middle America: hardworking folks raising families or already having raised them.\n\nNeighbors are familiar faces, and you can sense who fits in and who doesn’t. A friendly wave or smile is common, especially during barbecues or walks with the dog. Lawns are well-kept, green, and tidy, reflecting a sense of pride and community.\n\nWhile not a picture-perfect neighborhood, it possesses an understated beauty. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe—a haven where people yearn to live. Nearby, the county sheriff’s department and jail stand as a beacon of safety, while the health department and recycling center serve the community. Sports fields and an airport add to the tranquility, with the rumbles of small planes occasionally breaking the silence. A walk to the local ice cream shop or a bike ride to the park are common activities. Our small town airport is a short distance away, and my kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only 8 blocks away. It truly is a great place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "At first glance, you might overlook it - it's just a residential area hidden behind a shopping strip, not exactly the kind of place you'd expect to find a thriving community. But if you venture behind the long-abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that only fill up for a few days each summer, you'll stumble upon a lively neighborhood.

The street intersects with another residential road, leading to a park with children playing and retired folks walking their dogs. Nearby is a sushi place, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat hibachi chicken all in one visit - the strip mall's charm. There's even a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens gather with their skateboards, enjoying their sweet treats while performing tricks. This neighborhood is a slice of classic American life, frozen in time in the sleepy south.",
            "“Where's everything?” she asked, as we rolled past endless corn fields stretching to the horizon. “This is it!” I declared, knowing she'd be taken aback by the vast expanse. Hailing from a town where the grocery store was five minutes' walk from her house, she'd never seen such open space. Caught off guard by the omnipresent corn fields, I shared my rural Ohio upbringing and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you'll find a quarry filled with water, just past which lies the small development where I live. The houses are predominantly brick and stucco, each boasting at least a half acre of land meticulously maintained. During springtime, an abundance of annual flowers and Midwestern trees paint the landscape. Driveways gleam with high-end Mercedes Benzes fresh from a car wash. As we approach my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor, always cheerful, is outside tending to his lawn. His humming over the mower's noise has become a neighborhood staple. He used to be a doctor, blending in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you'll reach my home. Geese abound in the side yard, chased by our Terrier. A stream feeds into the quarry, where bullfrogs croak and the occasional “moo” resonates from nearby farms. A wooden bridge leads to an untouched oasis filled with native trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood playground, from building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals, there was always something to do and a neighborhood companion to join. Winter in my small town can be harsh, but there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms into a frozen wilderness. Trees shed vibrant autumn colors to become skeletal branches. Snowfall creates a winter wonderland, with my sister's snow angels and snowmen lining the backyard. We'd build igloo-like forts, stocked with branches, for our snowball wars. In our own winter wonderland, we played pretend, lost in a world where nothing else mattered.",
            "First off, let me just drop some knowledge: Portland, Oregon is just about the weirdest town you'll ever meet. The unofficial motto, emblazoned on the back of a pizza and bar and venue and strip club (yeah, you read that right) is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some folks see it as a nod to a past Portland, less known, less expensive, brimming with creative and unique subcultures. Others see it as a call to action, an invitation to embrace the weird and be weird, if you will. And even with the influx of California transplants and their condos, Portland's weirdness remains intact. Now, weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it does mean we're accepting of the unexpected. We've got our modern conveniences and our modern gripes, like the rest of the country, we buy most of our stuff from China. There's a million ways to be weird, to not fit the mold, but Portland's got plenty of normal too. There's yoga and hipsters and suits. Maybe weird means we just don't take it all so seriously. In my hood, and many Portland hoods, you'll find colorful houses, home gardens, and free boxes. These aren't your average cardboard boxes, folks. They contain treasures, clothes, books, anything you need. The magical potential of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland's all about, to me at least. But Portland's about more than free boxes and colorful houses. Portland's got goat yoga, Timbers matches, people who love their dreams and their bars. And yes, Portland's got a drug problem, which is often linked to mental health issues, and the constant rain and clouds don't help. Portland's also got a homelessness problem, more services than most places, but still not enough. We're a mix of care and hatred, and in that, Portland's not weird at all. It's just Portland.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast, north of where I live, greeting the sunrise and sunset daily. They are unyielding, even when my mind is elsewhere, lost in the whirlwind of work and life. When I'm most stressed or anxious, they call to me, offering respite and strength. I moved here for undergrad, and the mountains were what first captivated me. Sure, the campus has its own beauty with its buildings, ponds, and trees, but it's the mountains that command my attention. The rest of the town is charming, with beautiful cafes and a downtown area that bustles with energy, only to give way to the calm of the small-town vibe. The contrast of these atmospheres makes this city feel like an adventure waiting to be explored, filled with cherished memories like late-night walks past the rusted swings in the park or downtown runs to catch a movie. But it also holds harsh memories, as all places do. The ponds can be a place for reflection and tears, especially after an existential crisis. Watching the creatures living their lives can make one ponder their own purpose. One day, I realized I was walking north, towards the sunrise, and there they were. The mountains, as solid and strong as ever, adorned the sky, reminding me of my resilience.",
            "If you're planning to swing by Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding your way. It's got great public transit, which is a staple in NYC. Bensonhurst is right in the city's heart, with plenty of Asian-owned stores, especially supermarkets and laundromats, which are popular among locals for their quality, low prices, and convenience. We've got four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other! It's not just Asian, though; it's diverse with immigrants and their kids too. More corporate buildings? Nah, mostly co-ops, condos, and two-family houses. Oh, and noise? It's there. Cars blasting music, morning traffic, you name it. Nighttime? Be cautious, some unpredictable folks around. I've seen my fair share of trouble here, but that was years ago. Packets? They get stolen sometimes. And dog waste? It's a morning routine. Keep your shoes clean!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live, so everyone walks on the road, which can feel a bit dangerous with its potholes and the tattered wires dangling overhead. The trees, while beautiful, are often targeted for removal due to the view obstruction they cause. The houses here are built high up on the hill, with big glass windows to catch the ocean view. The weather is damp and overcast most days, with moss growing on everything, including my car, which turned green and furry in a month. There aren't many kids around, but there are plenty of dogs and wild rabbits, which my cats love to chase. The bay isn't wide, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. There are a few restaurants down the hill that serve fresh seafood, but not many stores. The view of the opposite shoreline is clear on most days, though the mist can be thick.",
            "I call home a typical suburban area in a small southern town nestled in Tennessee. Perched between two state highways, we've got more than our fair share of traffic, but other than that, it's a quiet, peaceful neighborhood. Folks around here are mainly content with their yard work and daily chores. Come winter, we make the most of the hills nearby for some good old-fashioned sledding. Our home's at the front corner of the street, so we're always in the loop with the comings and goings. We're a tight-knit crew, familiar with the cars and vehicles that frequent our streets. Whenever a new one appears, we take notice. Our neighbors like to walk for exercise or to walk their dogs, while the kids are always out on their bikes. We're a close-knit family, my wife and I, along with our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. We work from home, so we're well-known by the locals. We enjoy playing outside, even in the rain, and a barbecue on the back deck is always a hit. From March through October, you can't miss the steady hum of lawn mowers. Our neighborhood is filled with trees, a remnant of its past wooded glory, which means plenty of shade and a yearly leaf ritual in the fall. I'm partial to the smell of burning leaves, a sure sign of the changing season. Lately, winter has been a no-show, so it's felt more like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back, so the front door sees little use unless someone knocks, which isn't often. I enjoy tinkering with my truck and other projects in the garage, feeling more connected to the neighborhood when the doors are open. Holidays here are quiet affairs, with Thanksgiving and other holidays seeing a few extra cars parked along the street. All in all, I'm quite content with our little corner of the world. If it weren't a through street, it'd be perfect.",
            "My hood's smack dab in the high desert, where dirt is king, and when you do spot a lawn, you know someone's pouring cash into it. When I first landed here in the 90s, the houses were few and far between. Now, it's the same deal, but with a bunch of new additions. It's starting to look more city-like, I guess. Most folks are friendly, but like any city, it's got its ups and downs. I'm surrounded by nice old folks, so it's a pretty sweet neighborhood. The stores here are mostly chains like Food4Less and Smart & Final. For upscale, you've got to travel, as I've never seen Whole Foods or the like. The city's job scene is construction-heavy, probably because it's still not that developed. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, so I'm right in the middle of it. What I love about my home is the critters. People flock here for the desert's stark beauty, and the kids and I are all about the lizards and desert bugs. As for attractions, Victorville's a solid spot for families, especially with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. Or, hit up the snow-covered peaks in nearby Wrightwood and take some winter sports lessons. If you're into natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum's got you covered with geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and more.",
            "When asked to describe my 'hood, I reckon my response is a bit off the beaten path. While others are likely to talk about their own homes and lives, I've got a different story. My 'hood is the college campus I call home, with my dorm mates as my community. The campus itself is my 'hood too, albeit less so. Despite this quirk, my 'hood has some feel-good stuff in common with regular neighborhoods. Just like any other, it's got houses, folks, shops, and parks. Let's dive into the 'houses' of my 'hood. There are three main types of housing in my area: apartments, actual houses, and dorms. Apartments usually fit 2-4 folks per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people per building. Actual houses are 2-4 bedroom setups for affiliated school alumni, but they're fewer in number. Dorms? That's where most of the students live, with two per room and thousands of students in those big buildings. Moving on to the people, my school's all about diversity, and it shows in my 'hood. Staff live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. It's hard to do the folks of my 'hood justice just by talking about them, so let's move on to the shops and parks. Since my school is basically its own town, there's a ton of stores and one park. The stores are a mix of dining spots and school-branded shops. The park? It's a playground for the diverse bunch in my 'hood, kept clean and safe by everyone.",
            "Well, since I've been living here for about 10 years now, I can share some insights. When I first arrived, I was pretty bummed to leave Riverdale for Stockbridge. I cried on my way here, missing my old neighborhood and friends, but my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved. Our new neighborhood was considered \"not ghetto,\" and I eventually got used to it, making new friends and getting to know some of our neighbors. I spent time with Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis for a bit. They became like family to me, and I'm always looking forward to special events like Mr. Glen's wedding, where I caught the wife's little white strap. We danced and had a blast, especially with Marsharii, one of their daughters. It's been a while since I've seen her, though, but I hope she's doing great.\n\nThe neighborhood itself feels like a maze, but with my GPS, it's easier to explore. I've only made it so far, hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games, and enjoying nature. I also enjoy practicing my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bringing my bokken wooden sword. We used to play tennis and basketball too, with my dad and Mr. Graves pushing us hard but having fun. There's plenty of stories from my time here, but these are the ones that stand out. I'm looking forward to more adventures and fun in the future!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, so living here suits me just fine. Mostly, it's a mix of apartment buildings and a few cool, reasonably priced eateries and watering holes. One of the bars just got a new name, and while it's pricier now, the service and drinks are still solid. The people here are generally friendly, either fellow students or those on a budget due to the affordable housing. With an elementary school nearby, there are plenty of kids around. My neighbors? I don't really know them and I'm not sure I want to, especially since they seem to enjoy a bit too much weed. The management stuck an air freshener by their door to combat the smell, which was amusing. The buildings are a mix of old and new, with a few recent constructions that don't seem well-built. One area has a nice big sidewalk and a lot of greenery, but the apartments there are cheaply constructed and expensively rented out. There's a restaurant nearby that serves microwaved food on paper plates and a gas station that's not the best place to work. However, the street where I live has plenty of trees, and while a few have been cut down, there are still more trees than down the road. Behind my building, there's a tree line and another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd Street, but right behind me is 43rd Street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape and the buildings look run-down, with a lot of trees hiding the poor condition. There's been some crime at an apartment complex nearby, but no point in singling them out just because of that. There are also a lot of transient residents in the apartments across the street. Overall, I like where I live because it's affordable and conveniently located near the university and two bus stops.",
            "My 'hood is filled with duplexes on a cul-de-sac, each painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs, making them look like individual homes. We all get along, though not everyone is friends. We gather at the end of our driveway some evenings, chatting as kids play with their toys or fly kites. It's a refreshing break from our tech-filled world. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds. This is my small-town heaven, but there's a downside: tornado warnings. Last night, I heard the sirens and ended up in my bathtub with my purse and pillows, clutching my little dog. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought heavy hail and a sudden temperature drop. After the storm, the road was steaming, and I saw a double rainbow. I snapped photos to share with my Facebook friends. The streets were quiet for an hour before people started coming home. Then it was back to normal, with kids playing and moms cooking dinner. I love the southern accent and my two-bedroom, two-bath apartment. The neighborhood is a hidden gem, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by rooster crows and in the evening, a donkey braying from a nearby farm. I was lucky to find this charming neighborhood.",
            "I rolled into this hood just as I was about to hit eighth grade. It was tough at first to connect with locals, but eventually, I hooked up with two guys, one two houses down and another on my block. They've since moved on, but the memories linger. The original cast of characters is still here for the most part. My 'hood is your typical American suburban vibe—lots of two-story homes, weekend chatter, and mostly quiet weekdays. I've never had a beef with my neighbors. They keep to themselves, except when you need help. I've had numerous packages delivered, none snatched. I trust these folks. There's a park a couple of minutes away with a ton of good and bad memories. I've played ball there with the locals, and while I've got a nose injury to remember, the good times far outweigh the bad. Now, it's a place for my cousin's kids who are way younger than me. The park's nostalgia factor is off the charts. The neighborhood's diverse, with every cuisine you could want nearby. GrubHub and DoorDash are the go-to for food delivery these days, but there's always a pizza joint around. Stores have everything you need, from dry cleaners to Walgreens, CVS, and even an Indian-owned spot for some South Asian fare. It's a pretty great place, really. Reading about other folks' horror stories on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine all the more.",
            "Nestled in the heart of South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming little town that blends seamlessly with others in the state, but it's especially distinguished for its agricultural prowess. Johnston is affectionately dubbed the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title that's proudly displayed at the town's welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by sprawling farmlands, a patchwork of peach orchards and cattle pastures. Houses outside the town center are scattered, typically two-story structures with metal roofs to guard against the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes often sit further back from the road, allowing the front fields to serve as grazing or planting grounds. The town's central hub is marked by a solitary four-way stop light, where the sole retail establishments reside. There's your typical fast food fare—Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A former pizza joint has since closed, but Maxwell and Halford Drug, a quaint family-owned pharmacy, still stands, known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Shoppers can also pop into Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, the only grocery store, though many prefer the convenience of a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The Dollar General store is a local favorite, bustling from morning till night with an array of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, a longstanding fixture, is run by a kind woman who employs two movers for delivery. Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Away from the town center, there’s a modest elementary school and veterinary practice, but for entertainment, the pickings are lean. No movie theaters, bowling alleys, or parks, but there are plans afoot for a 2.5-acre recreational area to boost outdoor fun and attract residents. Despite the limited offerings, it's a sweet, quiet town where you can breeze right through without notice!",
            "The first time I stumbled upon the story of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was unexpected to hear that nearly every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends had heard about this, and I guess it's just the struggle we're all dealing with. Many of my friends find themselves struggling to make ends meet and can't get a good night's sleep. Things are expensive, but we've learned to make the most of what we have. You start to appreciate the nostalgic smell of old flea market toys and second-hand clothes. The smell of adulthood is like dust collecting on closed-up books and the scent of old leather. There are three thrift stores nearby, and if you start on the far side, you can pop into two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but you'd never know it in the thrift stores. Despite the constant flow of people and vehicles, the stores are always quiet. It's a cozy place to while away an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more people and cars. It's a developing city, they say, with one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York. Everyone here has their own goals, and no one really asks anything from you. You can be alone, keep to yourself, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where being caring means you care too much. Here, you can keep your distance, and the city will carry on like waves on the beach. It's a vibrant place to live. With the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something happening. It's like we're not just neighbors, but a community of friends. We help each other out with our needs, celebrate together, mourn together, and support each other when we can. I feel lucky to be here. Most of my neighbors are pretty cool, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, which they return the favor with. We share our mail and enjoy each other's company. I live in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't mess up my life completely.",
            "The area where I live has that classic cookie-cutter suburban vibe, with a strong presence of a homeowner's association. Walking in, you'll find a sea of pristine single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's diligent maintenance. The front yards are all alike, with a small patch of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot a small tree. Every home has a two-car garage. As you drive through, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in excellent condition, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, but you'll sometimes see two-story homes as well. Unlike traditional single-family homes, we don't have individual mailboxes; instead, there's a large cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, accessible via a key system. There are also larger lockers for packages. The HOA's attention to uniformity is evident here too. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, making my neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban living. We have plenty of open space, including multiple community pools and walking trails. These are well-maintained and gated, offering a great place to exercise or just take an evening stroll. Most of the residents are retired, with a sprinkling of middle-aged and young professionals. The city is surprisingly large by population but has a cozy small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, like a single mall that's not huge but functional. It takes around 15 minutes to reach it, and it's stocked with various stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets with a minimal staff. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard. We have pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next to any major shopping hubs, it's just a short drive away from all the big-name chains you could want.",
            "I reside in a small town situated right on the cusp of a major metro area's suburbs. In the eastern part of town, where I call home, you'll find the most economically challenged neighborhood. Most homes here are either rented by or owned by those with low incomes, but the area is far from unpleasant. Neighbors are generally warm, offering a friendly \"hello\" if you're out for a stroll. While crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of town, they're still quite low. A few violent incidents, like shootings and even a homicide, have occurred nearby in the past decade. Our neighbors sadly lost their son in a bar shooting last year. Our family has been fortunate enough to avoid direct crime, though we've had the occasional item vanish from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. The opioid epidemic has taken a toll on our town; many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are various resources in place to combat this, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions. Despite these challenges, the town offers several positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support crew. With special needs, he hasn't faced any bullying due to the school's positive atmosphere, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO planning multiple events throughout the year to engage families and foster educational growth. With over 20% of our town's population living below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is seen as less because of their financial status, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are quite reasonable. The City Council has made improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and city park refurbishments. Most of these improvements have been made in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are concentrated and traffic is heavy. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a source of frustration for residents here. Nevertheless, I enjoy living in this town. The people are friendly, the schools are great, there's plenty of shopping options to meet our family's needs, and our home, though not worth much, is comfortable and adequate. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My hood is packed with culture, nestled on a hill, with buildings that tell stories through their architecture. I'm in a 7-story apartment across from a historic theater, and a block down, there's this rad arcade bar that draws a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Lines form on weekends in June and July, especially for this place. Not far, there's a big city park with concrete steps leading up to it. In the cold months, you'll find homeless folks setting up tents in neat rows, keeping warm and close to the family center for showers and meals. My city's charm isn't in the grand old buildings or the historic vibes; it's in the people. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence, and even today, whispers of those times echo through the generations. The folks here work hard to clean up, even if it's still considered one of the tougher 'hoods. They care about their city, their block. There's a warning that white people shouldn't walk around at night, but I feel right at home here, meeting people who've shown me kindness. I've had strangers offer me their jackets or money, and I've felt alive walking these streets. Laundry owners stayed open late to help me charge my phone, and on the greyest nights, I've found myself invisible, yet valued, with someone stopping to hand me cash and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable. This place, it's not perfect, but it's mine, and it feels alive.",
            "In the heart of Rural America, more specifically, small-town Michigan, the landscape shifts from sprawling farmland to tiny tourist havens. The nearest big-box stores or chain restaurants are all a drive away. Yet, I reside in one of the most breathtaking spots on Earth, with Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering beaches at every turn.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town living. Homes aren't stacked high but rather spread out, each unique. Some are newly updated, while others hold a quaint, vintage charm. Many have full basements visible from the road, and aluminum siding is a common sight. Houses come in an array of colors, reflecting the individuality of their owners. Many homes boast trampolines, playsets, and even gardens or animal pens. It’s the epitome of Middle America: hardworking folks raising families or already having raised them.\n\nNeighbors are familiar faces, and you can sense who fits in and who doesn’t. A friendly wave or smile is common, especially during barbecues or walks with the dog. Lawns are well-kept, green, and tidy, reflecting a sense of pride and community.\n\nWhile not a picture-perfect neighborhood, it possesses an understated beauty. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe—a haven where people yearn to live. Nearby, the county sheriff’s department and jail stand as a beacon of safety, while the health department and recycling center serve the community. Sports fields and an airport add to the tranquility, with the rumbles of small planes occasionally breaking the silence. A walk to the local ice cream shop or a bike ride to the park are common activities. Our small town airport is a short distance away, and my kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only 8 blocks away. It truly is a great place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a sprawling metropolis means my hood is a hot mess of diverse neighborhoods, interspersed with commercial zones that are a mishmash of offices, stores, and joints. New eats and shops are always popping up, from big-name corps to cozy boutiques. Parks are packed with kids; we've got a vibrant LGBTQ+ crew, Orthodox Jews, and former Soviet immigrants all in one small area. Further out, you'll find pockets of various cultures like Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia, all within a stone's throw of each other. But a short drive can be a long journey thanks to killer traffic, especially during peak hours. Nobody walks around here, and parking's a nightmare. Despite the recent influx of new apartment buildings, some residents aren't thrilled with more people moving in or driving around. But it's not just high-rises; we've got houses and duplexes too, all sorts of housing options. The peeps are as diverse as the places, and I ain't intimate with most of my neighbors, though there were some cool memories growing up.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting mix of old and new, much like the American dream it represents. You'll find single-family homes, some split into two while still attached, all with small yards and driveways. The houses are a reminder of a simpler time, but the dream seems to be fading. The people here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, and the upkeep of the little yards has suffered. Yet, car-filled driveways and kids playing in the streets still fill the neighborhood with life. The historic public school, a beacon of the past, stands tall, while the basketball courts remain bustling. The houses may look different, but the spirit remains the same. A large Yemeni-owned supermarket, Super \"A\", is a staple, and the majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, perfect for kids playing football, while the residents are mostly long-term, with generations of stories to tell. A karate school that's now a pharmacy, a movie theater playing old films, and a single expressway that passes through our town are all part of the neighborhood's charm. There's a debate about adding an exit to our town, with the youth supporting it while the elders reject it. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to decide on a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin as the town's best representation.",
            "You might not give it a second glance - it's just a residential area behind a shopping strip, not exactly a place one would expect to find a thriving community. Frankly, it's not the kind of place most people would want to live. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and keep going past the hotels that only see action during a few summer reunions, you'll discover a whole different world. Nestled there are a few apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls carefully taken apart and placed side by side along the road. The first ones you'll see might have made headlines for some unsavory activities, so let's skip those. But the complexes next to them and the ones beside those are a whole other story, almost unknown to the locals. Across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus, a quiet little set of buildings where students stroll in at 7 AM with coffee, yawning as they start their sleepy days. The iron gates groan open to admit them, while morning commuters in their cars shake their fists and groan at the slow pace. The road intersects with another residential street, where a park and a rehabilitation center for folks with broken bones stand side by side. The rehab center has cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids are playing in the park, doing cartwheels and pinwheeling, while bees lazily buzz around the flower beds. Grandparents walk their dogs on the path, giving disapproving looks to skateboarding teens and nodding politely at teenage girls by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall near the park with affordable food and a swimming supply store next door, along with a nail salon in between. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken all at once - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt place where teens can be found with cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt, doing tricks on their skateboards and vaping. The entire neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "“Where are we going?” she asked as we cruised past the endless corn fields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. “This is it!” I declared, knowing full well she’d be taken aback by the sheer emptiness of the open landscape. She was from a town where the nearest grocery store was a five-minute walk from her doorstep—she’d never seen so much open country in her life. Overwhelmed by the omnipresence of corn fields, I shared my upbringing in rural Ohio with her, and in that instant, she finally understood who I was and where I hailed from. As we drove down a two-lane country road, you’ll come across a quarry brimming with water. Just beyond it lies the small development where I reside. The homes are mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least a half acre of land, which everyone takes great care to maintain. In the spring, vibrant flowers and midwestern trees in full bloom dot the landscape. The driveways are lined with high-end Mercedes-Benzes that gleam in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we approach my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside, greeting us with a warm smile. He spends his days mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he’s always genuine and has a unique past. He was once a doctor, and now he blends seamlessly with the lawn and his mower. Finally, you’ll arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese abound and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched Eden filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to “hunting” (chasing) animals, there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood kid eager for a playmate. The winters in my small town can be unforgiving, yet nothing is more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into a stark wilderness. The trees that once bore vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become barren skeletons of bark. With rare snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels and snowmen made by my younger sister, and snowballs are our winter weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our arsenal, usually using branches. In our own little wonderland, we’d play pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids with no cares in the world.",
            "The first thing you gotta get in your head about Portland, Oregon is this: it's weird. The unofficial town motto, scrawled on the side of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club (all rolled into one, and on the edge of legality), is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, it's a call to nostalgia, a Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less pricey, fostering creative and unique subcultures. To others, it's an invitation - come on down, where weird is now a compliment. Despite a flood of affluent Californians and constant construction of condos for these new residents, Portland remains weird. Weird here doesn't mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of the unexpected. It doesn't mean no modern conveniences or fights, we're just as consumer-driven as the rest of the country, buying most of our stuff from China. There's a million ways to be weird, but Portland's got plenty of normal too - yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe weird just means we take all of this a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, there are vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes, traditionally cardboard, but sometimes plastic, containing items people are giving away. They've got clothes, books, or even other treasures. The magical potential of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland's all about to me, but I'm just one flavor of weird among many. Some of my neighbors would never dream of picking clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (Portland's soccer team). Portland's full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland's full of dreamers, or at least people who like to dream while hanging out at the bar. Yeah, Portland's got a drug problem. Most drug problems are rooted in mental health issues, and the persistent rain and gloomy skies don't help. Portland's also got a homelessness issue, like everywhere else. Our social services are better than most, but they're still not enough. The non-homeless population swings between caring and hating. In this, Portland's not unique.",
            "The mountains have always been a constant in my life. They greet the sunrise and sunset each day, steadfast and unyielding, regardless of how preoccupied I am with work and life. On days when I'm overwhelmed, they call out to me, and when I turn to them, they offer solace and strength to carry on. It was during my undergrad years that I first moved here, and the mountains to the north of campus were the first thing that captivated me. Though the university has its own share of beautiful sights, it's the mountains that hold the real allure. The town itself is lovely, filled with cozy cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by coffee and study. You can venture a bit further to downtown, where old brick buildings and historic restaurants create an atmosphere of antiquity and energy reminiscent of urban life. But a short walk away, you can escape to the quiet, charming small-town feel with its quaint parks and houses. This blend of old and new gives the city a unique charm, beckoning exploration and cherished memories. Whether it's late-night walks with friends past the rusted swings in the park or a quick dash downtown to catch a movie, each locale holds a special place in my heart. However, not all memories are pleasant. The ponds, in particular, have witnessed my share of tears and existential crises. Watching the turtles and ducks go about their day can be a bittersweet reminder of my own struggles. But when I reach the main street and look up at the sunrise, I find myself walking north, towards those towering mountains. As they grace the sky, they remind me of my resilience, their silent presence a beacon of strength.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding your way. Public transport is super accessible and a New York City staple. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban area, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. Expect to see a slew of Asian stores around; over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a wave of Asian inhabitants. Walking down the streets, you'll find an Asian-owned store every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being the most popular. These places are a hit with locals thanks to their high-quality food, cheap prices, and convenience. There are even four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. Not to say Bensonhurst is dominated by Asians; it's a diverse melting pot with immigrants and their kids. Most big-name businesses are Asian-owned, and there's a newly renovated park nearby with ten basketball courts, a large field for sports, four handball courts, playgrounds for kids, and a water fountain. The park is a diverse hub where everyone gets along. There aren't many corporate buildings; mostly co-op dwellings and condos. Most residences are two-family houses, and while the locals are generally nice, the neighborhood can be noisy. Expect to hear car stereos blasting and gas pedals floored, especially in the morning. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with bullies and thieves around. I've been physically assaulted here, but that was years ago. There's also been package theft. Pets aren't well-behaved here; dog waste is an issue. Most people don't pick up after their dogs. Expect to see dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. This is my biggest gripe. Keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, sidewalks are a rare sight. My house is perched at the peak of the steepest incline in the neighborhood, earning it the moniker \"the work out hill\" for its popularity among joggers. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which is rough in places and can be treacherous to drive on. Telephone and electric wires are strung up, looking weather-beaten, with frequent repairs making them appear haphazard. Our area gets a lot of rain and storms, with branches and debris often taking out power lines. We have plenty of tall evergreen trees, but locals hate them because they block the ocean view. Houses are built high up with large glass fronted second stories to take in the bay view. Sunsets are spectacular when the water glows and the sky turns orange, but it's usually overcast, with most days being damp and mossy. Cars, roofs, and railings are often covered in moss, and I've had to spend hours scraping it off my car. Kids are scarce, but there are plenty of dogs running around. If you leave a door or window open, you might find one inside. Rabbits are common and love to dig up plants and lawns, much to the gardeners' annoyance. My cats keep them in check, though. We have a variety of birds, and the occasional hawk or eagle is spotted until chased off by neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but a hike downhill to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach is limited, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't wide, so you can see the opposite shoreline even through the mist.",
            "I nestle in a standard suburban zone of a little southern Tennessee town, right where two state highways intersect, so our block sees more traffic than I fancy. Beyond that, it's a peaceful neighborhood where people keep to themselves, tending to their yards and daily tasks. In winter, we make the most of the nearby hill, sledding down with the kids. Our house is at the front of the street, so we greet everyone who passes by and are well-versed with the local car fleet. Whenever a new vehicle cruises through, we take note. Neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their pups, children zoom on their bikes, and the usual suburban bustle unfolds. We're usually home, with my wife and two daughters (ages eleven and fourteen) working remotely. We step out for playtime, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, where the barbecue scent fills the air. Lawn mowers hum daily from March to October, and the changing seasons bring extra chores like raking and burning leaves. The smell of smoke from leaf fires signals the arrival of fall, which this year has felt endless. Our garage sits at the house's back, so the front door's only used when someone knocks, which is rare. I've taken to working in the garage on personal projects, and with the garage doors open, I stay connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a lull, but Thanksgiving and other such occasions see neighbors welcoming in loved ones from afar, leaving extra vehicles parked around. All in all, I enjoy our home, but if it weren't a through street, it'd be ideal.",
            "My hood's planted smack dab in the high desert, where dirt's the norm. Unless you've felt the desert's dry embrace, you won't truly understand the constant brown-ness and the lawns that scream \"unbelievable green.\" In the 90s, houses were scattered far apart, but now, it's mostly the same, with new developments cropping up daily. It's starting to feel more urban, city-like, but that's happening everywhere. Folks here are generally friendly, though like any city, there's a good and bad. My 'hood's mostly filled with kind seniors. Stores? Chains like Food for Less and Smart and Final. Organic options? Rare as a unicorn. The city's big on construction – it's undeveloped, so there's plenty of space to build. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and I love the desert's critters. My kids are lizard and bug enthusiasts, right now they're outside chasing specimens. Attractions? We have the Victorville Fair and Wrightwood's snowy peaks. And if you're into nature and history, check out the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When someone asks me about my neighborhood, I'll give you a unique answer. Unlike those who live nearby, I don't have a traditional street address or neighbors with their own lives. My neighborhood is the college campus where I reside, and the people in my dormitory are my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this quirk, my neighborhood shares common elements with more conventional ones. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses. Before diving in, it's important to clarify the types of houses in my neighborhood. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, and there are about 4-6 rooms per floor. On average, a building houses around 20 people. Actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually alumni living in 2-4 bedroom setups, but there are only a few of these scattered around. Dormitories house hundreds of students, with two people per room, and are the most common type of housing. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My campus values diversity, and this is reflected in my neighborhood. You'll find people from all cultures and ages. The professional staff tend to live in the houses, while newer students live in dorms and older students in apartments. Trying to describe the people here would be an understatement, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my neighborhood is self-contained, it has a variety of stores and a single park. You'll find dining options and unique school-branded stores, so anything you need can be found here. The park is a playground for the diverse residents, kept clean and crime-free by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Well, since I've been here for nearly a decade, I suppose I can dish out some insights. When I first arrived, I was far from thrilled. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a tearjerker, as I missed my old stomping grounds and the comforting familiarity. My parents, though, were hell-bent on providing the best for my sister and me, so we upped sticks to a ‘less ghetto’ hood with a better high school. It didn't take long to adapt, and I made some new chums (and foes) at school. Over the years, I've managed to get to know our neighbors, namely Mr. Glen, his clan, and Dennis, who live next door. They've become like family, especially when they tied the knot and invited us to the bash. I caught Ms. Veda’s garter, but alas, the bouquet? Missed it by a mile. We danced the night away, and it was a blast, though I haven't seen Marsharii, their daughter, since. I hope she's doing well.\n\nNavigating this neighborhood is like solving a maze, but my GPS has made it much easier to explore. I've ventured as far as the park, where I enjoy nature walks and practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken. My pals Kason and Curtis used to keep me company while we played vid games and just lived life to the fullest. There's also a basketball and tennis court, remnants of my tennis days under Mr. Graves' tutelage. It's been a while since I've picked up a racket, but it's always nice to have it there for when I feel like giving it another swing. Through it all, there's been plenty of fun, and I'm confident that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is within strolling distance of the college I attend, making my living situation quite convenient. While the area is dominated by apartment buildings, there are a handful of restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and relatively budget-friendly. One of the bars recently underwent a name change and is a bit pricier, but the service and drinks are still decent. The locals are generally nice, with a mix of college students and lower-income residents due to the affordable housing. The elementary school nearby means there are a lot of kids around, and while I don’t know my neighbors, their frequent weed smoking has led to a humorous air freshener unit outside their door. The buildings around me are mostly old but well-maintained, though there are newer ones down the street that I find unappealing due to their shoddy construction. One cheap eatery and a gas station are nearby, with the latter being notorious for its poor working conditions but redeemed by a recent road improvement project. My current building is surrounded by tall trees, with some stumps left behind after recent trimmings. Behind my complex is another apartment block, and across 42nd Street is 43rd Street, which is less appealing due to its dilapidated sidewalks and shabby buildings. The area also has a higher-than-average crime rate, especially around certain complexes, but I appreciate the affordability and proximity to the university and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, scattered and spaced out in a way that makes each one look like a standalone home. They're all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, and most of the neighbors are cordial with each other. We sometimes gather at the end of the driveway on quiet evenings, chatting while the kids play with their toys or fly kites. It’s a refreshing change from our modern, tech-filled world, like a step back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with a blue sky and white clouds overhead. The only downside this season was the tornado warnings; last night, we heard sirens for real, so we took shelter. I was in my bathtub with my little dog, a purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighborhood was quiet, save for the sound of large hail striking the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop—it was 92°F before the storm and 75°F afterwards. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as the clearing skies emerged, it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared, so I rushed inside to snap some photos for my Facebook friends and family; they were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for another hour before people began returning home, and then it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. It’s a friendly neighborhood for this gal who’s recently moved from NH to NC. We all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, but they’re not all the same inside. Some are quite small. I love walking by the biggest field behind my place and heading to the non-swimming pond where I’ve seen deer. The morning is greeted by rooster crowing from nearby farms, and in the evening, a donkey from a nearby farm lets out a bray. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood, just forty minutes outside of Charlotte. It’s like living in a small, self-contained village.",
            "I rolled into this hood just as I was about to dive into my eighth-grade year. Making friends initially was a struggle, but I eventually hit it off with a kid two doors down and another guy on my street. They're both gone now, but the memories linger. The originals who were here when I first arrived are still kicking around. My 'hood? Pretty standard suburban fare: two-story houses as far as the eye can see. The weekends are filled with the sound of kids playing outside whenever the weather permits. Monday through Friday? Quiet as a mouse. Neighborly relations have always been excellent – if you need a hand, you've got it. I've never had a package snagged off my porch, so I trust these folks. There's a park just a stone's throw away, filled with memories of youthful sports battles. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there. Sure, I've got a few war stories, like that time I got a football to the nose, but the good outweighs the bad. Now? I take my little cousins there to play on the swings and slides. Just seeing them light up makes me feel all nostalgic. Diversity? You won't find it lacking here. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian eats abound within a mile radius, and if you're feeling lazy, apps like GrubHub and DoorDash will deliver. Fast food is ubiquitous, of course, but there's also a plethora of pizza joints. Stores? They've got it all. Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco – even an Indian-owned shop for those authentic curries or ready-made meals. Overall, I dig my 'hood. Watching the news or scrolling through social media, seeing what others go through with their neighbors, it makes me appreciate mine all the more.",
            "The little town I call home is like many others in South Carolina, unassuming but integral to the state's agricultural landscape. Johnston, the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" proudly displays this title on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, either sprouting peach trees or grazing cattle. Houses, often two-story with metal or gray shingle roofs, dot the countryside, with many perched on front fields for crops and livestock. In the town's core, a single stoplight oversees a four-way intersection, home to the town's singular stores. Fast food options include Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, while Maxwell and Halford Drug is the go-to spot for Cherry Coca-Cola. The sole grocery store is the pricy IGA, though many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General is the town's main hub, brisk with activity from morning till night. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a community-loved woman, sits next to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet services. Medical care is provided by a doctor's and vet practice, though both are small and unassuming. Johnston Elementary School serves students through fifth grade, after which they must travel to the next town for middle and high school. The town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area, but it's not exactly bustling with entertainment. With no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or parks, it's a quiet town, small enough to quickly pass through without notice!",
            "The first time I'd heard of where I live, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit of a shock to learn that nearly every apartment in the area was going for over a grand a month. I hadn't heard anything about it before, and neither had any of my friends. Life's expensive, but we've found ways to be frugal over the years. You get used to the smell of dusty flea market toys and mothballed clothes. The aroma of adulthood is a mix of old magazines stacked on a closed piano and a leather chair that never loses its scent even after washing. In my neighborhood, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's as quiet as a library. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. The city's growing, with more people and cars every year. It's like New York, everyone's focused on their own goals, and you can be as independent as you want. You don't have to be concerned, like in the South where people might pry. You can keep your distance here, and the city will roll with it like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with a pianist next door and amateur vocalists upstairs. We have more of a community of friends than a collection of strangers. We help each other out, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and just enjoy each other's company. I'm lucky to live here. My neighbors are great, and we look out for each other. I leave them food and take care of their mail, and they do the same for me. I might live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make it feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "The neighborhood I call home is a textbook example of cookie-cutter suburbia. The homeowner's association here is a force to be reckoned with, ensuring that every home is pristine. The yards are uniformly landscaped with grass patches, decorative pebbles, and short drives, and the two-car garages are a staple. As you drive through, you'll notice the roads are newly paved and in top condition, with no potholes to be found. Most homes are single-story, but occasionally you'll spot a two-story residence. Instead of individual mailboxes, we have a communal setup at the end of the street, with lockers for packages. The neighborhood is a mix of rural and suburban, with plenty of land for outdoor activities like swimming in one of the several community pools or walking on the many trails. The majority of residents are retirees, but there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city we're part of is surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a mall (though it's not massive) and stores ranging from high-end grocery stores stocked with organic foods to bargain outlets with minimal staff. All in all, it's a safe, well-maintained area with a lot of nice things like pools and trails. While we're not right next door to big-time shopping, a quick car ride gets you to any major chain you could want.",
            "I call this small Midwestern town my home, tucked right outside the sprawling suburbs of a major city. My immediate 'hood, the east side, is where the financially disadvantaged folks dwell. The properties are cheap, with most homes rented or owned by those making ends meet. It's not all aesthetically pleasing, but my neighbors are warm and will greet you with a smile. Crime's a tad higher here, but it's not a war zone—just a few violent incidents over the past decade. Our town's been hit hard by the opioid crisis, with fentanyl overdoses claiming lives. But we've got resources: rehab centers and Narcan training. Despite its struggles, this town has its charms. My kid's elementary school's top-notch, with staff who go above and beyond. He's thriving, no bullying, and the PTO keeps things lit. The school feeds all kids, no one goes hungry. The City Council's done a lot, but the east side's been left out. Over 20% live below the poverty line, but they're not treated as less. Our family's here for the long haul. We've seen ups and downs, but it's home.",
            "My 'hood is a cultural haven. It's nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings with rich history. I live in a 7-story apartment across from the old Live Theater, and just a block down is an arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Lines form often, especially in June and July, for a taste of that lively atmosphere. A few blocks up, there's a large park that's bigger than you'd expect. Its concrete encirclement and tall stairs around it provide shelter for the homeless during the harsh winters. Though it doesn't snow much, the relentless rain makes it tough to stay warm. They set up tents in rows, central and visible, close to the family center where they can bathe and shower. But what makes my 'hood special isn't the architectural beauty or history. It's the people. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and while the stories are still told, the people are resilient. They work hard to keep the neighborhood clean, and they care about what happens in their community. You hear warnings about walking alone on the Hill at night if you're white, but maybe it's just a reminder of the past, or maybe I'm dark enough to slide through the cracks. Maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own. It's a place where kindness is offered freely, and strangers help each other. It's a home, and I feel alive walking those streets, meeting people who've shown me more kindness than expected. I've found a sense of belonging here, and it's a place I'll always call home.",
            "I hail from rural America, nestled in the heart of small town Michigan. From farm country to tourist hotspots, there's not much in the way of bustling city life. Forget about big malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or even Applebee’s – everything is a drive away. But I live in one of the most breathtaking places on Earth, bookended by two stunning lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you'll find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood echoes the essence of small town America. Houses aren't stacked like canned goods; they're older homes, some updated, some not. Many have full basements, and you'll find a kaleidoscope of colors in the siding. From trampolines to gardens, each yard is unique. Neighbors are close-knit, and you'll recognize the faces. People wave, smile, and greet each other, keeping their properties well-maintained. Granted, it's not the flashiest neighborhood, but it's a haven for raising a family – peaceful, safe, and quiet. A stroll around the block might lead you to the county sheriff's department, health department, or city recycling center. Baseball fields and the local airport are nearby, and the sound of planes taking off and landing adds to the charm. You can walk to the ice cream shop or make a bike ride down to town. My kids can pedal to the park just 8 blocks away. It’s a perfect place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a sprawling metropolis means my hood is a hot mess of diverse neighborhoods, interspersed with commercial zones that are a mishmash of offices, stores, and joints. New eats and shops are always popping up, from big-name corps to cozy boutiques. Parks are packed with kids; we've got a vibrant LGBTQ+ crew, Orthodox Jews, and former Soviet immigrants all in one small area. Further out, you'll find pockets of various cultures like Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia, all within a stone's throw of each other. But a short drive can be a long journey thanks to killer traffic, especially during peak hours. Nobody walks around here, and parking's a nightmare. Despite the recent influx of new apartment buildings, some residents aren't thrilled with more people moving in or driving around. But it's not just high-rises; we've got houses and duplexes too, all sorts of housing options. The peeps are as diverse as the places, and I ain't intimate with most of my neighbors, though there were some cool memories growing up.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting mix of old and new, much like the American dream it represents. You'll find single-family homes, some split into two while still attached, all with small yards and driveways. The houses are a reminder of a simpler time, but the dream seems to be fading. The people here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, and the upkeep of the little yards has suffered. Yet, car-filled driveways and kids playing in the streets still fill the neighborhood with life. The historic public school, a beacon of the past, stands tall, while the basketball courts remain bustling. The houses may look different, but the spirit remains the same. A large Yemeni-owned supermarket, Super \"A\", is a staple, and the majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, perfect for kids playing football, while the residents are mostly long-term, with generations of stories to tell. A karate school that's now a pharmacy, a movie theater playing old films, and a single expressway that passes through our town are all part of the neighborhood's charm. There's a debate about adding an exit to our town, with the youth supporting it while the elders reject it. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to decide on a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin as the town's best representation.",
            "You might not give it a second glance - it's just a residential area behind a shopping strip, not exactly a place one would expect to find a thriving community. Frankly, it's not the kind of place most people would want to live. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and keep going past the hotels that only see action during a few summer reunions, you'll discover a whole different world. Nestled there are a few apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls carefully taken apart and placed side by side along the road. The first ones you'll see might have made headlines for some unsavory activities, so let's skip those. But the complexes next to them and the ones beside those are a whole other story, almost unknown to the locals. Across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus, a quiet little set of buildings where students stroll in at 7 AM with coffee, yawning as they start their sleepy days. The iron gates groan open to admit them, while morning commuters in their cars shake their fists and groan at the slow pace. The road intersects with another residential street, where a park and a rehabilitation center for folks with broken bones stand side by side. The rehab center has cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids are playing in the park, doing cartwheels and pinwheeling, while bees lazily buzz around the flower beds. Grandparents walk their dogs on the path, giving disapproving looks to skateboarding teens and nodding politely at teenage girls by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall near the park with affordable food and a swimming supply store next door, along with a nail salon in between. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken all at once - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt place where teens can be found with cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt, doing tricks on their skateboards and vaping. The entire neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "“Where are we going?” she asked as we cruised past the endless corn fields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. “This is it!” I declared, knowing full well she’d be taken aback by the sheer emptiness of the open landscape. She was from a town where the nearest grocery store was a five-minute walk from her doorstep—she’d never seen so much open country in her life. Overwhelmed by the omnipresence of corn fields, I shared my upbringing in rural Ohio with her, and in that instant, she finally understood who I was and where I hailed from. As we drove down a two-lane country road, you’ll come across a quarry brimming with water. Just beyond it lies the small development where I reside. The homes are mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least a half acre of land, which everyone takes great care to maintain. In the spring, vibrant flowers and midwestern trees in full bloom dot the landscape. The driveways are lined with high-end Mercedes-Benzes that gleam in the midday sun after a thorough car wash.

He spends his days mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower.

Out back, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms.

From building tree forts to “hunting” (chasing) animals, there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood kid eager for a playmate. The winters in my small town can be unforgiving, yet nothing is more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into a stark wilderness. The trees that once bore vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become barren skeletons of bark. With rare snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels and snowmen made by my younger sister, and snowballs are our winter weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our arsenal, usually using branches. In our own little wonderland, we’d play pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids with no cares in the world.",
            "The first thing you gotta get in your head about Portland, Oregon is this: it's weird. The unofficial town motto, scrawled on the side of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club (all rolled into one, and on the edge of legality), is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, it's a call to nostalgia, a Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less pricey, fostering creative and unique subcultures. To others, it's an invitation - come on down, where weird is now a compliment. Despite a flood of affluent Californians and constant construction of condos for these new residents, Portland remains weird. Weird here doesn't mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of the unexpected. It doesn't mean no modern conveniences or fights, we're just as consumer-driven as the rest of the country, buying most of our stuff from China. There's a million ways to be weird, but Portland's got plenty of normal too - yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe weird just means we take all of this a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, there are vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes, traditionally cardboard, but sometimes plastic, containing items people are giving away. They've got clothes, books, or even other treasures. The magical potential of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland's all about to me, but I'm just one flavor of weird among many. Some of my neighbors would never dream of picking clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (Portland's soccer team). Portland's full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland's full of dreamers, or at least people who like to dream while hanging out at the bar. Yeah, Portland's got a drug problem. Most drug problems are rooted in mental health issues, and the persistent rain and gloomy skies don't help. Portland's also got a homelessness issue, like everywhere else. Our social services are better than most, but they're still not enough. The non-homeless population swings between caring and hating. In this, Portland's not unique.",
            "The mountains have always been a constant in my life. They greet the sunrise and sunset each day, steadfast and unyielding, regardless of how preoccupied I am with work and life. On days when I'm overwhelmed, they call out to me, and when I turn to them, they offer solace and strength to carry on. It was during my undergrad years that I first moved here, and the mountains to the north of campus were the first thing that captivated me. Though the university has its own share of beautiful sights, it's the mountains that hold the real allure. The town itself is lovely, filled with cozy cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by coffee and study. You can venture a bit further to downtown, where old brick buildings and historic restaurants create an atmosphere of antiquity and energy reminiscent of urban life. But a short walk away, you can escape to the quiet, charming small-town feel with its quaint parks and houses. This blend of old and new gives the city a unique charm, beckoning exploration and cherished memories. Whether it's late-night walks with friends past the rusted swings in the park or a quick dash downtown to catch a movie, each locale holds a special place in my heart. However, not all memories are pleasant. The ponds, in particular, have witnessed my share of tears and existential crises. Watching the turtles and ducks go about their day can be a bittersweet reminder of my own struggles. But when I reach the main street and look up at the sunrise, I find myself walking north, towards those towering mountains. As they grace the sky, they remind me of my resilience, their silent presence a beacon of strength.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding your way. Public transport is super accessible and a New York City staple. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban area, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. Expect to see a slew of Asian stores around; over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a wave of Asian inhabitants. Walking down the streets, you'll find an Asian-owned store every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being the most popular. These places are a hit with locals thanks to their high-quality food, cheap prices, and convenience. There are even four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. Not to say Bensonhurst is dominated by Asians; it's a diverse melting pot with immigrants and their kids. Most big-name businesses are Asian-owned, and there's a newly renovated park nearby with ten basketball courts, a large field for sports, four handball courts, playgrounds for kids, and a water fountain. The park is a diverse hub where everyone gets along. There aren't many corporate buildings; mostly co-op dwellings and condos. Most residences are two-family houses, and while the locals are generally nice, the neighborhood can be noisy. Expect to hear car stereos blasting and gas pedals floored, especially in the morning. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with bullies and thieves around. I've been physically assaulted here, but that was years ago. There's also been package theft. Pets aren't well-behaved here; dog waste is an issue. Most people don't pick up after their dogs. Expect to see dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. This is my biggest gripe. Keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, sidewalks are a rare sight. My house is perched at the peak of the steepest incline in the neighborhood, earning it the moniker \"the work out hill\" for its popularity among joggers. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which is rough in places and can be treacherous to drive on. Telephone and electric wires are strung up, looking weather-beaten, with frequent repairs making them appear haphazard. Our area gets a lot of rain and storms, with branches and debris often taking out power lines. We have plenty of tall evergreen trees, but locals hate them because they block the ocean view. Houses are built high up with large glass fronted second stories to take in the bay view. Sunsets are spectacular when the water glows and the sky turns orange, but it's usually overcast, with most days being damp and mossy. Cars, roofs, and railings are often covered in moss, and I've had to spend hours scraping it off my car. Kids are scarce, but there are plenty of dogs running around. If you leave a door or window open, you might find one inside. Rabbits are common and love to dig up plants and lawns, much to the gardeners' annoyance. My cats keep them in check, though. We have a variety of birds, and the occasional hawk or eagle is spotted until chased off by neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but a hike downhill to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach is limited, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't wide, so you can see the opposite shoreline even through the mist.",
            "I nestle in a standard suburban zone of a little southern Tennessee town, right where two state highways intersect, so our block sees more traffic than I fancy. Beyond that, it's a peaceful neighborhood where people keep to themselves, tending to their yards and daily tasks. In winter, we make the most of the nearby hill, sledding down with the kids. Our house is at the front of the street, so we greet everyone who passes by and are well-versed with the local car fleet. Whenever a new vehicle cruises through, we take note. Neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their pups, children zoom on their bikes, and the usual suburban bustle unfolds. We're usually home, with my wife and two daughters (ages eleven and fourteen) working remotely. We step out for playtime, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, where the barbecue scent fills the air. Lawn mowers hum daily from March to October, and the changing seasons bring extra chores like raking and burning leaves. The smell of smoke from leaf fires signals the arrival of fall, which this year has felt endless. Our garage sits at the house's back, so the front door's only used when someone knocks, which is rare. I've taken to working in the garage on personal projects, and with the garage doors open, I stay connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a lull, but Thanksgiving and other such occasions see neighbors welcoming in loved ones from afar, leaving extra vehicles parked around. All in all, I enjoy our home, but if it weren't a through street, it'd be ideal.",
            "My hood's planted smack dab in the high desert, where dirt's the norm. Unless you've felt the desert's dry embrace, you won't truly understand the constant brown-ness and the lawns that scream \"unbelievable green.\" In the 90s, houses were scattered far apart, but now, it's mostly the same, with new developments cropping up daily. It's starting to feel more urban, city-like, but that's happening everywhere. Folks here are generally friendly, though like any city, there's a good and bad. My 'hood's mostly filled with kind seniors. Stores? Chains like Food for Less and Smart and Final. Organic options? Rare as a unicorn. The city's big on construction – it's undeveloped, so there's plenty of space to build. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and I love the desert's critters. My kids are lizard and bug enthusiasts, right now they're outside chasing specimens. Attractions? We have the Victorville Fair and Wrightwood's snowy peaks. And if you're into nature and history, check out the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When someone asks me about my neighborhood, I'll give you a unique answer. Unlike those who live nearby, I don't have a traditional street address or neighbors with their own lives. My neighborhood is the college campus where I reside, and the people in my dormitory are my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this quirk, my neighborhood shares common elements with more conventional ones. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses. Before diving in, it's important to clarify the types of houses in my neighborhood. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, and there are about 4-6 rooms per floor. On average, a building houses around 20 people. Actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually alumni living in 2-4 bedroom setups, but there are only a few of these scattered around. Dormitories house hundreds of students, with two people per room, and are the most common type of housing. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My campus values diversity, and this is reflected in my neighborhood. You'll find people from all cultures and ages. The professional staff tend to live in the houses, while newer students live in dorms and older students in apartments. Trying to describe the people here would be an understatement, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my neighborhood is self-contained, it has a variety of stores and a single park. You'll find dining options and unique school-branded stores, so anything you need can be found here. The park is a playground for the diverse residents, kept clean and crime-free by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Well, since I've been here for nearly a decade, I suppose I can dish out some insights. When I first arrived, I was far from thrilled. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a tearjerker, as I missed my old stomping grounds and the comforting familiarity. My parents, though, were hell-bent on providing the best for my sister and me, so we upped sticks to a ‘less ghetto’ hood with a better high school. It didn't take long to adapt, and I made some new chums (and foes) at school. Over the years, I've managed to get to know our neighbors, namely Mr. Glen, his clan, and Dennis, who live next door. They've become like family, especially when they tied the knot and invited us to the bash. I caught Ms. Veda’s garter, but alas, the bouquet? Missed it by a mile. We danced the night away, and it was a blast, though I haven't seen Marsharii, their daughter, since. I hope she's doing well.\n\nNavigating this neighborhood is like solving a maze, but my GPS has made it much easier to explore. I've ventured as far as the park, where I enjoy nature walks and practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken. My pals Kason and Curtis used to keep me company while we played vid games and just lived life to the fullest. There's also a basketball and tennis court, remnants of my tennis days under Mr. Graves' tutelage. It's been a while since I've picked up a racket, but it's always nice to have it there for when I feel like giving it another swing. Through it all, there's been plenty of fun, and I'm confident that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is within strolling distance of the college I attend, making my living situation quite convenient. While the area is dominated by apartment buildings, there are a handful of restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and relatively budget-friendly. One of the bars recently underwent a name change and is a bit pricier, but the service and drinks are still decent. The locals are generally nice, with a mix of college students and lower-income residents due to the affordable housing. The elementary school nearby means there are a lot of kids around, and while I don’t know my neighbors, their frequent weed smoking has led to a humorous air freshener unit outside their door. The buildings around me are mostly old but well-maintained, though there are newer ones down the street that I find unappealing due to their shoddy construction. One cheap eatery and a gas station are nearby, with the latter being notorious for its poor working conditions but redeemed by a recent road improvement project. My current building is surrounded by tall trees, with some stumps left behind after recent trimmings. Behind my complex is another apartment block, and across 42nd Street is 43rd Street, which is less appealing due to its dilapidated sidewalks and shabby buildings. The area also has a higher-than-average crime rate, especially around certain complexes, but I appreciate the affordability and proximity to the university and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, scattered and spaced out in a way that makes each one look like a standalone home. They're all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, and most of the neighbors are cordial with each other. We sometimes gather at the end of the driveway on quiet evenings, chatting while the kids play with their toys or fly kites. It’s a refreshing change from our modern, tech-filled world, like a step back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with a blue sky and white clouds overhead. The only downside this season was the tornado warnings; last night, we heard sirens for real, so we took shelter. I was in my bathtub with my little dog, a purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighborhood was quiet, save for the sound of large hail striking the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop—it was 92°F before the storm and 75°F afterwards. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as the clearing skies emerged, it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared, so I rushed inside to snap some photos for my Facebook friends and family; they were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for another hour before people began returning home, and then it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. It’s a friendly neighborhood for this gal who’s recently moved from NH to NC. We all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, but they’re not all the same inside. Some are quite small. I love walking by the biggest field behind my place and heading to the non-swimming pond where I’ve seen deer. The morning is greeted by rooster crowing from nearby farms, and in the evening, a donkey from a nearby farm lets out a bray. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood, just forty minutes outside of Charlotte. It’s like living in a small, self-contained village.",
            "I rolled into this hood just as I was about to dive into my eighth-grade year. Making friends initially was a struggle, but I eventually hit it off with a kid two doors down and another guy on my street. They're both gone now, but the memories linger. The originals who were here when I first arrived are still kicking around. My 'hood? Pretty standard suburban fare: two-story houses as far as the eye can see. The weekends are filled with the sound of kids playing outside whenever the weather permits. Monday through Friday? Quiet as a mouse. Neighborly relations have always been excellent – if you need a hand, you've got it. I've never had a package snagged off my porch, so I trust these folks. There's a park just a stone's throw away, filled with memories of youthful sports battles. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there. Sure, I've got a few war stories, like that time I got a football to the nose, but the good outweighs the bad. Now? I take my little cousins there to play on the swings and slides. Just seeing them light up makes me feel all nostalgic. Diversity? You won't find it lacking here. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian eats abound within a mile radius, and if you're feeling lazy, apps like GrubHub and DoorDash will deliver. Fast food is ubiquitous, of course, but there's also a plethora of pizza joints. Stores? They've got it all. Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco – even an Indian-owned shop for those authentic curries or ready-made meals. Overall, I dig my 'hood. Watching the news or scrolling through social media, seeing what others go through with their neighbors, it makes me appreciate mine all the more.",
            "The little town I call home is like many others in South Carolina, unassuming but integral to the state's agricultural landscape. Johnston, the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" proudly displays this title on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, either sprouting peach trees or grazing cattle. Houses, often two-story with metal or gray shingle roofs, dot the countryside, with many perched on front fields for crops and livestock. In the town's core, a single stoplight oversees a four-way intersection, home to the town's singular stores. Fast food options include Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, while Maxwell and Halford Drug is the go-to spot for Cherry Coca-Cola. The sole grocery store is the pricy IGA, though many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General is the town's main hub, brisk with activity from morning till night. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a community-loved woman, sits next to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet services. Medical care is provided by a doctor's and vet practice, though both are small and unassuming. Johnston Elementary School serves students through fifth grade, after which they must travel to the next town for middle and high school. The town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area, but it's not exactly bustling with entertainment. With no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or parks, it's a quiet town, small enough to quickly pass through without notice!",
            "The first time I'd heard of where I live, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit of a shock to learn that nearly every apartment in the area was going for over a grand a month. I hadn't heard anything about it before, and neither had any of my friends. Life's expensive, but we've found ways to be frugal over the years. You get used to the smell of dusty flea market toys and mothballed clothes. The aroma of adulthood is a mix of old magazines stacked on a closed piano and a leather chair that never loses its scent even after washing. In my neighborhood, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's as quiet as a library. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. The city's growing, with more people and cars every year. It's like New York, everyone's focused on their own goals, and you can be as independent as you want. You don't have to be concerned, like in the South where people might pry. You can keep your distance here, and the city will roll with it like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with a pianist next door and amateur vocalists upstairs. We have more of a community of friends than a collection of strangers. We help each other out, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and just enjoy each other's company. I'm lucky to live here. My neighbors are great, and we look out for each other. I leave them food and take care of their mail, and they do the same for me. I might live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make it feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "The neighborhood I call home is a textbook example of cookie-cutter suburbia. The homeowner's association here is a force to be reckoned with, ensuring that every home is pristine. The yards are uniformly landscaped with grass patches, decorative pebbles, and short drives, and the two-car garages are a staple. As you drive through, you'll notice the roads are newly paved and in top condition, with no potholes to be found. Most homes are single-story, but occasionally you'll spot a two-story residence. Instead of individual mailboxes, we have a communal setup at the end of the street, with lockers for packages. The neighborhood is a mix of rural and suburban, with plenty of land for outdoor activities like swimming in one of the several community pools or walking on the many trails. The majority of residents are retirees, but there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city we're part of is surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a mall (though it's not massive) and stores ranging from high-end grocery stores stocked with organic foods to bargain outlets with minimal staff. All in all, it's a safe, well-maintained area with a lot of nice things like pools and trails. While we're not right next door to big-time shopping, a quick car ride gets you to any major chain you could want.",
            "I call this small Midwestern town my home, tucked right outside the sprawling suburbs of a major city. My immediate 'hood, the east side, is where the financially disadvantaged folks dwell. The properties are cheap, with most homes rented or owned by those making ends meet. It's not all aesthetically pleasing, but my neighbors are warm and will greet you with a smile. Crime's a tad higher here, but it's not a war zone—just a few violent incidents over the past decade. Our town's been hit hard by the opioid crisis, with fentanyl overdoses claiming lives. But we've got resources: rehab centers and Narcan training. Despite its struggles, this town has its charms. My kid's elementary school's top-notch, with staff who go above and beyond. He's thriving, no bullying, and the PTO keeps things lit. The school feeds all kids, no one goes hungry. The City Council's done a lot, but the east side's been left out. Over 20% live below the poverty line, but they're not treated as less. Our family's here for the long haul. We've seen ups and downs, but it's home.",
            "My 'hood is a cultural haven. It's nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings with rich history. I live in a 7-story apartment across from the old Live Theater, and just a block down is an arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Lines form often, especially in June and July, for a taste of that lively atmosphere. A few blocks up, there's a large park that's bigger than you'd expect. Its concrete encirclement and tall stairs around it provide shelter for the homeless during the harsh winters. Though it doesn't snow much, the relentless rain makes it tough to stay warm. They set up tents in rows, central and visible, close to the family center where they can bathe and shower. But what makes my 'hood special isn't the architectural beauty or history. It's the people. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and while the stories are still told, the people are resilient. They work hard to keep the neighborhood clean, and they care about what happens in their community. You hear warnings about walking alone on the Hill at night if you're white, but maybe it's just a reminder of the past, or maybe I'm dark enough to slide through the cracks. Maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own. It's a place where kindness is offered freely, and strangers help each other. It's a home, and I feel alive walking those streets, meeting people who've shown me more kindness than expected. I've found a sense of belonging here, and it's a place I'll always call home.",
            "I hail from rural America, nestled in the heart of small town Michigan. From farm country to tourist hotspots, there's not much in the way of bustling city life. Forget about big malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or even Applebee’s – everything is a drive away. But I live in one of the most breathtaking places on Earth, bookended by two stunning lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you'll find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood echoes the essence of small town America. Houses aren't stacked like canned goods; they're older homes, some updated, some not. Many have full basements, and you'll find a kaleidoscope of colors in the siding. From trampolines to gardens, each yard is unique. Neighbors are close-knit, and you'll recognize the faces. People wave, smile, and greet each other, keeping their properties well-maintained. Granted, it's not the flashiest neighborhood, but it's a haven for raising a family – peaceful, safe, and quiet. A stroll around the block might lead you to the county sheriff's department, health department, or city recycling center. Baseball fields and the local airport are nearby, and the sound of planes taking off and landing adds to the charm. You can walk to the ice cream shop or make a bike ride down to town. My kids can pedal to the park just 8 blocks away. It’s a perfect place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a sprawling metropolis means my hood is a hot mess of diverse neighborhoods, interspersed with commercial zones that are a mishmash of offices, stores, and joints. New eats and shops are always popping up, from big-name corps to cozy boutiques. Parks are packed with kids; we've got a vibrant LGBTQ+ crew, Orthodox Jews, and former Soviet immigrants all in one small area. Further out, you'll find pockets of various cultures like Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia, all within a stone's throw of each other. But a short drive can be a long journey thanks to killer traffic, especially during peak hours. Nobody walks around here, and parking's a nightmare. Despite the recent influx of new apartment buildings, some residents aren't thrilled with more people moving in or driving around. But it's not just high-rises; we've got houses and duplexes too, all sorts of housing options. The peeps are as diverse as the places, and I ain't intimate with most of my neighbors, though there were some cool memories growing up.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting mix of old and new, much like the American dream it represents. You'll find single-family homes, some split into two while still attached, all with small yards and driveways. The houses are a reminder of a simpler time, but the dream seems to be fading. The people here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, and the upkeep of the little yards has suffered. Yet, car-filled driveways and kids playing in the streets still fill the neighborhood with life. The historic public school, a beacon of the past, stands tall, while the basketball courts remain bustling. The houses may look different, but the spirit remains the same. A large Yemeni-owned supermarket, Super \"A\", is a staple, and the majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, perfect for kids playing football, while the residents are mostly long-term, with generations of stories to tell. A karate school that's now a pharmacy, a movie theater playing old films, and a single expressway that passes through our town are all part of the neighborhood's charm. There's a debate about adding an exit to our town, with the youth supporting it while the elders reject it. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to decide on a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin as the town's best representation.",
            "You might not give it a second glance - it's just a residential area behind a shopping strip, not exactly a place one would expect to find a thriving community. Frankly, it's not the kind of place most people would want to live. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and keep going past the hotels that only see action during a few summer reunions, you'll discover a whole different world. Nestled there are a few apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls carefully taken apart and placed side by side along the road. The first ones you'll see might have made headlines for some unsavory activities, so let's skip those. But the complexes next to them and the ones beside those are a whole other story, almost unknown to the locals. Across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus, a quiet little set of buildings where students stroll in at 7 AM with coffee, yawning as they start their sleepy days. The iron gates groan open to admit them, while morning commuters in their cars shake their fists and groan at the slow pace. The road intersects with another residential street, where a park and a rehabilitation center for folks with broken bones stand side by side. The rehab center has cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids are playing in the park, doing cartwheels and pinwheeling, while bees lazily buzz around the flower beds. Grandparents walk their dogs on the path, giving disapproving looks to skateboarding teens and nodding politely at teenage girls by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall near the park with affordable food and a swimming supply store next door, along with a nail salon in between. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken all at once - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt place where teens can be found with cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt, doing tricks on their skateboards and vaping. The entire neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "“Where are we going?” she asked as we cruised past the endless corn fields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. “This is it!” I declared, knowing full well she’d be taken aback by the sheer emptiness of the open landscape. She was from a town where the nearest grocery store was a five-minute walk from her doorstep—she’d never seen so much open country in her life. Overwhelmed by the omnipresence of corn fields, I shared my upbringing in rural Ohio with her, and in that instant, she finally understood who I was and where I hailed from. As we drove down a two-lane country road, you’ll come across a quarry brimming with water. Just beyond it lies the small development where I reside. The homes are mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least a half acre of land, which everyone takes great care to maintain. In the spring, vibrant flowers and midwestern trees in full bloom dot the landscape. The driveways are lined with high-end Mercedes-Benzes that gleam in the midday sun after a thorough car wash.

The trees that once bore vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become barren skeletons of bark. With rare snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels and snowmen made by my younger sister, and snowballs are our winter weapon of choice.

We were just young kids with no cares in the world.",
            "The first thing you gotta get in your head about Portland, Oregon is this: it's weird. The unofficial town motto, scrawled on the side of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club (all rolled into one, and on the edge of legality), is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, it's a call to nostalgia, a Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less pricey, fostering creative and unique subcultures. To others, it's an invitation - come on down, where weird is now a compliment. Despite a flood of affluent Californians and constant construction of condos for these new residents, Portland remains weird. Weird here doesn't mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of the unexpected. It doesn't mean no modern conveniences or fights, we're just as consumer-driven as the rest of the country, buying most of our stuff from China. There's a million ways to be weird, but Portland's got plenty of normal too - yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe weird just means we take all of this a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, there are vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes, traditionally cardboard, but sometimes plastic, containing items people are giving away. They've got clothes, books, or even other treasures. The magical potential of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland's all about to me, but I'm just one flavor of weird among many. Some of my neighbors would never dream of picking clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (Portland's soccer team). Portland's full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland's full of dreamers, or at least people who like to dream while hanging out at the bar. Yeah, Portland's got a drug problem. Most drug problems are rooted in mental health issues, and the persistent rain and gloomy skies don't help. Portland's also got a homelessness issue, like everywhere else. Our social services are better than most, but they're still not enough. The non-homeless population swings between caring and hating. In this, Portland's not unique.",
            "The mountains have always been a constant in my life. They greet the sunrise and sunset each day, steadfast and unyielding, regardless of how preoccupied I am with work and life. On days when I'm overwhelmed, they call out to me, and when I turn to them, they offer solace and strength to carry on. It was during my undergrad years that I first moved here, and the mountains to the north of campus were the first thing that captivated me. Though the university has its own share of beautiful sights, it's the mountains that hold the real allure. The town itself is lovely, filled with cozy cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by coffee and study. You can venture a bit further to downtown, where old brick buildings and historic restaurants create an atmosphere of antiquity and energy reminiscent of urban life. But a short walk away, you can escape to the quiet, charming small-town feel with its quaint parks and houses. This blend of old and new gives the city a unique charm, beckoning exploration and cherished memories. Whether it's late-night walks with friends past the rusted swings in the park or a quick dash downtown to catch a movie, each locale holds a special place in my heart. However, not all memories are pleasant. The ponds, in particular, have witnessed my share of tears and existential crises. Watching the turtles and ducks go about their day can be a bittersweet reminder of my own struggles. But when I reach the main street and look up at the sunrise, I find myself walking north, towards those towering mountains. As they grace the sky, they remind me of my resilience, their silent presence a beacon of strength.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding your way. Public transport is super accessible and a New York City staple. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban area, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. Expect to see a slew of Asian stores around; over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a wave of Asian inhabitants. Walking down the streets, you'll find an Asian-owned store every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being the most popular. These places are a hit with locals thanks to their high-quality food, cheap prices, and convenience. There are even four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. Not to say Bensonhurst is dominated by Asians; it's a diverse melting pot with immigrants and their kids. Most big-name businesses are Asian-owned, and there's a newly renovated park nearby with ten basketball courts, a large field for sports, four handball courts, playgrounds for kids, and a water fountain. The park is a diverse hub where everyone gets along. There aren't many corporate buildings; mostly co-op dwellings and condos. Most residences are two-family houses, and while the locals are generally nice, the neighborhood can be noisy. Expect to hear car stereos blasting and gas pedals floored, especially in the morning. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with bullies and thieves around. I've been physically assaulted here, but that was years ago. There's also been package theft. Pets aren't well-behaved here; dog waste is an issue. Most people don't pick up after their dogs. Expect to see dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. This is my biggest gripe. Keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, sidewalks are a rare sight. My house is perched at the peak of the steepest incline in the neighborhood, earning it the moniker \"the work out hill\" for its popularity among joggers. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which is rough in places and can be treacherous to drive on. Telephone and electric wires are strung up, looking weather-beaten, with frequent repairs making them appear haphazard. Our area gets a lot of rain and storms, with branches and debris often taking out power lines. We have plenty of tall evergreen trees, but locals hate them because they block the ocean view. Houses are built high up with large glass fronted second stories to take in the bay view. Sunsets are spectacular when the water glows and the sky turns orange, but it's usually overcast, with most days being damp and mossy. Cars, roofs, and railings are often covered in moss, and I've had to spend hours scraping it off my car. Kids are scarce, but there are plenty of dogs running around. If you leave a door or window open, you might find one inside. Rabbits are common and love to dig up plants and lawns, much to the gardeners' annoyance. My cats keep them in check, though. We have a variety of birds, and the occasional hawk or eagle is spotted until chased off by neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but a hike downhill to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach is limited, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't wide, so you can see the opposite shoreline even through the mist.",
            "I nestle in a standard suburban zone of a little southern Tennessee town, right where two state highways intersect, so our block sees more traffic than I fancy. Beyond that, it's a peaceful neighborhood where people keep to themselves, tending to their yards and daily tasks. In winter, we make the most of the nearby hill, sledding down with the kids. Our house is at the front of the street, so we greet everyone who passes by and are well-versed with the local car fleet. Whenever a new vehicle cruises through, we take note. Neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their pups, children zoom on their bikes, and the usual suburban bustle unfolds. We're usually home, with my wife and two daughters (ages eleven and fourteen) working remotely. We step out for playtime, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, where the barbecue scent fills the air. Lawn mowers hum daily from March to October, and the changing seasons bring extra chores like raking and burning leaves. The smell of smoke from leaf fires signals the arrival of fall, which this year has felt endless. Our garage sits at the house's back, so the front door's only used when someone knocks, which is rare. I've taken to working in the garage on personal projects, and with the garage doors open, I stay connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a lull, but Thanksgiving and other such occasions see neighbors welcoming in loved ones from afar, leaving extra vehicles parked around. All in all, I enjoy our home, but if it weren't a through street, it'd be ideal.",
            "My hood's planted smack dab in the high desert, where dirt's the norm. Unless you've felt the desert's dry embrace, you won't truly understand the constant brown-ness and the lawns that scream \"unbelievable green.\" In the 90s, houses were scattered far apart, but now, it's mostly the same, with new developments cropping up daily. It's starting to feel more urban, city-like, but that's happening everywhere. Folks here are generally friendly, though like any city, there's a good and bad. My 'hood's mostly filled with kind seniors. Stores? Chains like Food for Less and Smart and Final. Organic options? Rare as a unicorn. The city's big on construction – it's undeveloped, so there's plenty of space to build. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and I love the desert's critters. My kids are lizard and bug enthusiasts, right now they're outside chasing specimens. Attractions? We have the Victorville Fair and Wrightwood's snowy peaks. And if you're into nature and history, check out the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When someone asks me about my neighborhood, I'll give you a unique answer. Unlike those who live nearby, I don't have a traditional street address or neighbors with their own lives. My neighborhood is the college campus where I reside, and the people in my dormitory are my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this quirk, my neighborhood shares common elements with more conventional ones. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses. Before diving in, it's important to clarify the types of houses in my neighborhood. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, and there are about 4-6 rooms per floor. On average, a building houses around 20 people. Actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually alumni living in 2-4 bedroom setups, but there are only a few of these scattered around. Dormitories house hundreds of students, with two people per room, and are the most common type of housing. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My campus values diversity, and this is reflected in my neighborhood. You'll find people from all cultures and ages. The professional staff tend to live in the houses, while newer students live in dorms and older students in apartments. Trying to describe the people here would be an understatement, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my neighborhood is self-contained, it has a variety of stores and a single park. You'll find dining options and unique school-branded stores, so anything you need can be found here. The park is a playground for the diverse residents, kept clean and crime-free by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Well, since I've been here for nearly a decade, I suppose I can dish out some insights. When I first arrived, I was far from thrilled. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a tearjerker, as I missed my old stomping grounds and the comforting familiarity. My parents, though, were hell-bent on providing the best for my sister and me, so we upped sticks to a ‘less ghetto’ hood with a better high school. It didn't take long to adapt, and I made some new chums (and foes) at school. Over the years, I've managed to get to know our neighbors, namely Mr. Glen, his clan, and Dennis, who live next door. They've become like family, especially when they tied the knot and invited us to the bash. I caught Ms. Veda’s garter, but alas, the bouquet? Missed it by a mile. We danced the night away, and it was a blast, though I haven't seen Marsharii, their daughter, since. I hope she's doing well.\n\nNavigating this neighborhood is like solving a maze, but my GPS has made it much easier to explore. I've ventured as far as the park, where I enjoy nature walks and practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken. My pals Kason and Curtis used to keep me company while we played vid games and just lived life to the fullest. There's also a basketball and tennis court, remnants of my tennis days under Mr. Graves' tutelage. It's been a while since I've picked up a racket, but it's always nice to have it there for when I feel like giving it another swing. Through it all, there's been plenty of fun, and I'm confident that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is within strolling distance of the college I attend, making my living situation quite convenient. While the area is dominated by apartment buildings, there are a handful of restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and relatively budget-friendly. One of the bars recently underwent a name change and is a bit pricier, but the service and drinks are still decent. The locals are generally nice, with a mix of college students and lower-income residents due to the affordable housing. The elementary school nearby means there are a lot of kids around, and while I don’t know my neighbors, their frequent weed smoking has led to a humorous air freshener unit outside their door. The buildings around me are mostly old but well-maintained, though there are newer ones down the street that I find unappealing due to their shoddy construction. One cheap eatery and a gas station are nearby, with the latter being notorious for its poor working conditions but redeemed by a recent road improvement project. My current building is surrounded by tall trees, with some stumps left behind after recent trimmings. Behind my complex is another apartment block, and across 42nd Street is 43rd Street, which is less appealing due to its dilapidated sidewalks and shabby buildings. The area also has a higher-than-average crime rate, especially around certain complexes, but I appreciate the affordability and proximity to the university and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, scattered and spaced out in a way that makes each one look like a standalone home. They're all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, and most of the neighbors are cordial with each other. We sometimes gather at the end of the driveway on quiet evenings, chatting while the kids play with their toys or fly kites. It’s a refreshing change from our modern, tech-filled world, like a step back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with a blue sky and white clouds overhead. The only downside this season was the tornado warnings; last night, we heard sirens for real, so we took shelter. I was in my bathtub with my little dog, a purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighborhood was quiet, save for the sound of large hail striking the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop—it was 92°F before the storm and 75°F afterwards. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as the clearing skies emerged, it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared, so I rushed inside to snap some photos for my Facebook friends and family; they were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for another hour before people began returning home, and then it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. It’s a friendly neighborhood for this gal who’s recently moved from NH to NC. We all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, but they’re not all the same inside. Some are quite small. I love walking by the biggest field behind my place and heading to the non-swimming pond where I’ve seen deer. The morning is greeted by rooster crowing from nearby farms, and in the evening, a donkey from a nearby farm lets out a bray. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood, just forty minutes outside of Charlotte. It’s like living in a small, self-contained village.",
            "I rolled into this hood just as I was about to dive into my eighth-grade year. Making friends initially was a struggle, but I eventually hit it off with a kid two doors down and another guy on my street. They're both gone now, but the memories linger. The originals who were here when I first arrived are still kicking around. My 'hood? Pretty standard suburban fare: two-story houses as far as the eye can see. The weekends are filled with the sound of kids playing outside whenever the weather permits. Monday through Friday? Quiet as a mouse. Neighborly relations have always been excellent – if you need a hand, you've got it. I've never had a package snagged off my porch, so I trust these folks. There's a park just a stone's throw away, filled with memories of youthful sports battles. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there. Sure, I've got a few war stories, like that time I got a football to the nose, but the good outweighs the bad. Now? I take my little cousins there to play on the swings and slides. Just seeing them light up makes me feel all nostalgic. Diversity? You won't find it lacking here. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian eats abound within a mile radius, and if you're feeling lazy, apps like GrubHub and DoorDash will deliver. Fast food is ubiquitous, of course, but there's also a plethora of pizza joints. Stores? They've got it all. Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco – even an Indian-owned shop for those authentic curries or ready-made meals. Overall, I dig my 'hood. Watching the news or scrolling through social media, seeing what others go through with their neighbors, it makes me appreciate mine all the more.",
            "The little town I call home is like many others in South Carolina, unassuming but integral to the state's agricultural landscape. Johnston, the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" proudly displays this title on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, either sprouting peach trees or grazing cattle. Houses, often two-story with metal or gray shingle roofs, dot the countryside, with many perched on front fields for crops and livestock. In the town's core, a single stoplight oversees a four-way intersection, home to the town's singular stores. Fast food options include Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, while Maxwell and Halford Drug is the go-to spot for Cherry Coca-Cola. The sole grocery store is the pricy IGA, though many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General is the town's main hub, brisk with activity from morning till night. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a community-loved woman, sits next to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet services. Medical care is provided by a doctor's and vet practice, though both are small and unassuming. Johnston Elementary School serves students through fifth grade, after which they must travel to the next town for middle and high school. The town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area, but it's not exactly bustling with entertainment. With no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or parks, it's a quiet town, small enough to quickly pass through without notice!",
            "The first time I'd heard of where I live, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit of a shock to learn that nearly every apartment in the area was going for over a grand a month. I hadn't heard anything about it before, and neither had any of my friends. Life's expensive, but we've found ways to be frugal over the years. You get used to the smell of dusty flea market toys and mothballed clothes. The aroma of adulthood is a mix of old magazines stacked on a closed piano and a leather chair that never loses its scent even after washing. In my neighborhood, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's as quiet as a library. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. The city's growing, with more people and cars every year. It's like New York, everyone's focused on their own goals, and you can be as independent as you want. You don't have to be concerned, like in the South where people might pry. You can keep your distance here, and the city will roll with it like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with a pianist next door and amateur vocalists upstairs. We have more of a community of friends than a collection of strangers. We help each other out, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and just enjoy each other's company. I'm lucky to live here. My neighbors are great, and we look out for each other. I leave them food and take care of their mail, and they do the same for me. I might live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make it feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "The neighborhood I call home is a textbook example of cookie-cutter suburbia. The homeowner's association here is a force to be reckoned with, ensuring that every home is pristine. The yards are uniformly landscaped with grass patches, decorative pebbles, and short drives, and the two-car garages are a staple. As you drive through, you'll notice the roads are newly paved and in top condition, with no potholes to be found. Most homes are single-story, but occasionally you'll spot a two-story residence. Instead of individual mailboxes, we have a communal setup at the end of the street, with lockers for packages. The neighborhood is a mix of rural and suburban, with plenty of land for outdoor activities like swimming in one of the several community pools or walking on the many trails. The majority of residents are retirees, but there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city we're part of is surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a mall (though it's not massive) and stores ranging from high-end grocery stores stocked with organic foods to bargain outlets with minimal staff. All in all, it's a safe, well-maintained area with a lot of nice things like pools and trails. While we're not right next door to big-time shopping, a quick car ride gets you to any major chain you could want.",
            "I call this small Midwestern town my home, tucked right outside the sprawling suburbs of a major city. My immediate 'hood, the east side, is where the financially disadvantaged folks dwell. The properties are cheap, with most homes rented or owned by those making ends meet. It's not all aesthetically pleasing, but my neighbors are warm and will greet you with a smile. Crime's a tad higher here, but it's not a war zone—just a few violent incidents over the past decade. Our town's been hit hard by the opioid crisis, with fentanyl overdoses claiming lives. But we've got resources: rehab centers and Narcan training. Despite its struggles, this town has its charms. My kid's elementary school's top-notch, with staff who go above and beyond. He's thriving, no bullying, and the PTO keeps things lit. The school feeds all kids, no one goes hungry. The City Council's done a lot, but the east side's been left out. Over 20% live below the poverty line, but they're not treated as less. Our family's here for the long haul. We've seen ups and downs, but it's home.",
            "My 'hood is a cultural haven. It's nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings with rich history. I live in a 7-story apartment across from the old Live Theater, and just a block down is an arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Lines form often, especially in June and July, for a taste of that lively atmosphere. A few blocks up, there's a large park that's bigger than you'd expect. Its concrete encirclement and tall stairs around it provide shelter for the homeless during the harsh winters. Though it doesn't snow much, the relentless rain makes it tough to stay warm. They set up tents in rows, central and visible, close to the family center where they can bathe and shower. But what makes my 'hood special isn't the architectural beauty or history. It's the people. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and while the stories are still told, the people are resilient. They work hard to keep the neighborhood clean, and they care about what happens in their community. You hear warnings about walking alone on the Hill at night if you're white, but maybe it's just a reminder of the past, or maybe I'm dark enough to slide through the cracks. Maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own. It's a place where kindness is offered freely, and strangers help each other. It's a home, and I feel alive walking those streets, meeting people who've shown me more kindness than expected. I've found a sense of belonging here, and it's a place I'll always call home.",
            "I hail from rural America, nestled in the heart of small town Michigan. From farm country to tourist hotspots, there's not much in the way of bustling city life. Forget about big malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or even Applebee’s – everything is a drive away. But I live in one of the most breathtaking places on Earth, bookended by two stunning lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you'll find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood echoes the essence of small town America. Houses aren't stacked like canned goods; they're older homes, some updated, some not. Many have full basements, and you'll find a kaleidoscope of colors in the siding. From trampolines to gardens, each yard is unique. Neighbors are close-knit, and you'll recognize the faces. People wave, smile, and greet each other, keeping their properties well-maintained. Granted, it's not the flashiest neighborhood, but it's a haven for raising a family – peaceful, safe, and quiet. A stroll around the block might lead you to the county sheriff's department, health department, or city recycling center. Baseball fields and the local airport are nearby, and the sound of planes taking off and landing adds to the charm. You can walk to the ice cream shop or make a bike ride down to town. My kids can pedal to the park just 8 blocks away. It’s a perfect place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Expand a bit, and you'll find a mosaic of ethnic enclaves like Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia, though reaching them can be a lengthy journey due to the city's size and traffic. Rush hour grinds progress to a halt, with parking spots as elusive as the elusive unicorn. Ironically, recent years have seen a boom in construction, with towering apartment buildings sprouting up, much to the dismay of locals dreading the influx of more people and vehicles.

And certainly not places most people would want to dwell. But if you venture behind the old, disused Whole Foods store, and weave your way through the hotels that only come alive for family reunions in the summertime, you'll uncover a thriving community. Nestled along these streets are a cluster of apartment complexes, arranged like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully dismantled and set side by side. The first batch of apartments you'll see have been in the news for some shady dealings, so we won't dwell on those here - appearances can be deceiving. But the ones beside that complex, and the ones next to that, are a world of their own that few locals know about. Right across from these communities lies a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings where students start their day with a yawn over coffee, and commuters roll their eyes at the traffic delays caused by students arriving in droves. The road here is a T-bone, leading into another residential road with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who've had unfortunate bone breaks. The center is equipped with cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan, churning the warm, thick summer air. Kids dart about in the park, performing cartwheels and pirouettes over prickly grass, while bees lazily buzz in the nearby flower patches. Old folks walk their dogs along the path, giving disapproving looks to skateboarders and polite nods to teenage girls gossiping by the playground equipment. There's a sushi place, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon in a nearby strip mall, offering a one-stop shop for seasonal pool fills, manicures, and hibachi chicken. A DIY frozen yogurt shop is also nearby, where teens often share their cold, dripping treats while performing tricks on their skateboards.

            "Where is everything going on? she asked as we cruised past the endless corn fields that stretched out before us. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she'd be blown away by the sheer emptiness of the open landscape.

Mesmerized by the corn fields, I took the opportunity to share my upbringing in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.

            "If you’re trying to get your head around Portland, Oregon, you gotta start with the phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\". It's more than just a catchy slogan; it's a rallying cry for the Portland of yesteryears, a time when it was less known, less expensive, and brimming with creative eccentricities. To some, it's an invitation to a place where being weird is seen as a compliment. The city's charm hasn't been eroded by the influx of wealthy Californians and their condos, nor by the constant construction that has followed. Portland remains weird, accepting of the unusual, but also holding onto its quirky spirit. It's a place where yoga and hipsters mingle with business professionals, and even the most mundane tasks are approached with a hint of whimsy. Neighborhoods like mine are peppered with colorful houses, home gardens, and free boxes containing treasures that appear like magic to the wandering eye. These boxes are usually filled with clothes and books, but you never know what you might find. The magic of Portland is that it’s a place where anything can happen, a belief shared by people who love goats (yes, goat yoga and Timbers matches), dreamers who hit the town and the bar a little too often, and of course, those who are dealing with drug and mental health issues. Portland's homelessness problem is a reflection of a global issue, and while Portland offers better social services, they struggle to keep up. There's a constant tug-of-war between care and hatred in the crowd. But in this, Portland is just like everywhere else.",
            "The mountains are always there, a constant companion to the sun’s daily journey. No matter how busy I get or how much I forget about them, they stand tall and unyielding, unaffected by life's ups and downs. On my most stressful days, they demand my attention, and when I turn to them, they offer a sense of calm, giving me the strength to endure one more day. I first moved here for my undergrad, and the mountains north of campus immediately caught my eye. Sure, the university has its own share of beauty in its buildings and ponds and trees, but the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is a stark contrast to the bustling city nearby, with its charming cafés and antique brick buildings. This blend of atmospheres creates a unique charm, making the city feel like a place to explore. I have made many cherished memories here, from studying at the local cafés to running through downtown to catch a movie. However, it’s also home to some painful memories, as all places are. The ponds can be a place of reflection, even tears during existential crises. As I watch the pond's inhabitants live their lives, I often question my own purpose in navigating life. Walking north, I find myself drawn to the mountains, where the sun paints the sky with its rays. The mountains, as they always do, remind me of my resilience, standing tall and steadfast.",
            "Heading to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn? No sweat! Public transport is a breeze and a go-to in NYC. With its urban vibe, you'll feel right at home. Explore the area and you'll find Asian shops galore. For the past 20 years or so, Bensonhurt's seen a influx of Asian inhabitants, so expect to pass at least one Asian-owned supermarket or laundromat every block. Locals swear by these places for their quality food, lower prices, and convenience. I've got four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk from my spot, perfect for quick grocery runs. But Bensonhurt's not just Asian. It's a melting pot with immigrants and their kids, and a good chunk of local businesses are Asian-owned. Plus, there's a newly spruced-up park nearby with ten basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, four handball courts, swings, and a playground. Diverse fun abounds, and it's all within reach. Skip the corporate buildings; it's mostly co-ops and condos here, with two-family houses being the norm. People are generally friendly, but expect some noise—cars blasting tunes, early morning revs, and the occasional ruckus. Nighttime can be dicey, with unpredictable folks and potential trouble. I've had my share of issues: past physical assault and package theft. Doggy doo is a problem too; I see it daily. Keep your shoes clean and be cautious!",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are a rare commodity. The streets slope downwards, and my house perches at the summit of the steepest hill, affectionately dubbed the \"workout hill\" due to the joggers who regularly traverse it. The lack of sidewalks means pedestrians have no choice but to walk on the road, which is marred by potholes and can feel treacherous to drive on. The telephone and electrical wires strung across the block are in poor condition, tattered by the elements. Rain and storms are frequent, and the resultant debris often brings down power lines, leaving them looking like a patchwork quilt. Evergreen trees dot the landscape, but locals despise them, preferring to cut them down as they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill, with spacious glass-fronted second stories to capture the view of the bay. Sunsets are breathtaking, with the water appearing illuminated from below and the sky turning orange. However, it's often overcast, and the view is filtered through a haze. Most days are damp and dreary, with moss growing on everything from rooftops to cars and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and it was covered in green furry moss by the time I returned. It took three hours to scrub it off.\n\nKids are scarce in the neighborhood, but a school is nearby. Most residents are elderly, many retired, and dogs fill the void left by children. They lounge in lawns or race down the street, occasionally sneaking into open homes. Rabbits are a common sight, digging up plant roots and burrowing into lawns, much to the gardeners' dismay. However, my cats have hunted many of them out. Birds are plentiful, ranging from tiny sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle, which is usually chased away by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but a hike downhill leads to a few waterfront restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore provide a fun spot for tossing into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and the opposite shoreline is clearly visible, even through the mist.",
            "I call this place home - a typical southern suburb, nestled between two state highways, so we get the occasional traffic, but the neighborhood is otherwise quiet. We're a neighborhood that sticks together, so everyone knows each other and their cars. We have our routines - yard work, daily chores, winter sledding on the side street. We're a family of four - myself, my wife, and two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. We're often seen coming and going, so we're part of the familiar scenery. There's a rhythm to our days, dictated by the changing seasons. Spring and summer are filled with the hum of lawnmowers, while fall brings the smell of burning leaves. Our backyard is our sanctuary, where we grill, play, and enjoy the shade from the trees. Winter is a bit of a letdown this year, as it feels like a long fall. Our garage is our workshop, a place where I tinker with my truck and keep an ear on the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet here, except for the extra cars parked around during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas. It's a simple life, but I wouldn't have it any other way. If only it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My 'hood's right in the thick of the high desert, where dirt reigns supreme. Unless you've been here, it's hard to grasp the constant brown landscape and the rarity of well-maintained lawns. Back in the 90s, houses were spread out like they were in the wild west. Now, it's pretty much the same, but there are new additions popping up, making it look like a city. The locals are mostly friendly, though like any city, there are good and bad areas. My neck of the woods is filled with friendly old-timers, so it's a pleasant neighborhood. The stores here are mostly chain places like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're after upscale, you'll have to venture out. We're not exactly Whole Foods territory. Construction seems to be the main gig here, with plenty of wide-open spaces for building. It's a bit scary, as I love how things are now. I swapped the big city for this and I'm not keen on going back. My full-time gig is drywall and T-bar installation, right in the middle of it all. One of the cool things about living here is the diverse animals. Folks flock here for the stark beauty of the desert, and the unique ecosystems it creates. Residents should learn about the wildlife to coexist safely. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and they're out there hunting for specimens right now. There are attractions too, like the San Bernardino County Fair, which is a must-visit. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-capped mountains and winter sports. And if you're into natural history, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's packed with geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "When someone asks me to describe my hood, my response is more than a little unusual. While most people picture houses and families, I live in a college campus. My dorm is my home, and my community is the people around me. Even the surrounding campus feels like part of my neighborhood, albeit less so. Despite its unconventionality, my neighborhood shares traits with any standard one. You'll find houses, folk, stores, and parks aplenty. Let's start with the houses that make up my neighborhood, and clarify what they're actually like. There are three types of housing in my immediate area: apartments, houses, and dorms. Apartments house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. Most buildings have 2 floors, so they fit around 20 people. Actual houses are for rent, usually by alumni, and are spread thin. The majority of my neighborhood is dorm-style, with 100s of students living in them. About 2 people share a room, with some exceptions. Now for the people. My school loves diversity, which reflects in the folks living here. Professionals live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. It's hard to truly capture the diversity here, so let's move on to stores and parks. As a self-contained campus, my neighborhood has dining options and unique stores, plus a park where everyone hangs out. It's clean and crime-free thanks to all of us living here!",
            "Considering I've been here for a decade, let me share my experiences. When I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was genuinely bummed. The change was a lot to handle, but my parents wanted the best for me and my sister. The new neighborhood wasn't exactly where I wanted to be, but I adapted and made some friends, and even a few enemies, in school. Over the years, I've grown close to Mr. Glen and his kids, Dennis too, and I consider them part of the family. I was at Mr. Glen's wedding and even caught his wife's garter! I haven't seen Marsharii since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood can be a bit of a labyrinth, but with a GPS, I explore more. I've spent time with Kason and Curtis, playing video games, enjoying nature, and practicing my balance with sticks from Home Depot. There's a basketball and tennis court, too, a reminder of my days learning tennis with Mr. Graves. I've had many fun times here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My pad is in the vicinity of the college I attend, and that's a plus. The neighborhood's mostly apartment buildings, but there are a couple of eateries and bars that are budget-friendly and fun. One bar recently got a new name, but it's pricier, though quality isn't suffering too much. People around here are generally friendly, college kids or lower-income residents since housing is affordable. An elementary school is nearby, so there's plenty of kid action. I don't know my neighbors much, and that's fine with me. They enjoy their weed, and the management's response was to put an air freshener by their door. It's amusing but slightly insulting. The buildings here are mostly old but well-maintained. Further down the road, there are newer apartments, but they're cheaply constructed and overpriced, thanks to their proximity to campus. A nearby restaurant serves meals on paper plates and mostly microwaves its dishes. A gas station is next door, and although it's not great for employees, the city's recent roadwork has improved the area with new sidewalks and greenery. My place is shaded by plenty of trees, and there's a large tree line behind my complex. The street behind me, 43rd, is a bit rougher, with shabby buildings and poor sidewalks. Crime has been an issue, including at nearby complexes. Still, I like living here. It's affordable, and amenities are within walking distance, especially the university. There are also two bus stops nearby, making it easy to get around.",

We're not all pals, but most of us are friends, and we enjoy hanging out at the end of our driveways, chatting while the kids play. It's a refreshing break from the modern, tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields, trees, and clear blue skies, but this season's tornado warnings have been a bit scary. Last night, my smallest dog and I took shelter in the bathtub during a storm, while the big one stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, but the hail was heavy. After the storm, the road steamed as the temperature dropped from 92 to 75 degrees. It was surreal to see the hail melt instantly and then watch a double rainbow appear. I snapped some photos to share with friends and family. The streets were quiet for a while before people started to return home. It's a friendly neighborhood, perfect for someone like me who moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else, but the interiors vary. I love the southern accent and the big field behind my place, where I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs sing. I'm fortunate to live in this small community village just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by rooster crows and in the evening, a donkey's bray from a nearby farm. It's a gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I rolled into this hood just as my eighth grade was kicking off. Establishing friendships was a grind initially, but I eventually buddied up with a dude two doors down and another fella on my street. We might not be neighbors anymore, but the memories linger. The original residents are still here, making it feel like a classic American suburban joint. Two-story dwellings and weekends filled with kids' laughter outside are the norm. Weekdays are quiet, except for the odd time when I need a helping hand. Package snatching? Never happened. I trust my neighbors. The park a few minutes away is a treasure trove of nostalgia. I've played soccer, basketball, and baseball there, with memorable highs and lows, like that one football incident. Now it's all about watching my cousin's little ones enjoy the swings and slides. Just thinking about it brings back a flood of memories. The neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures and cuisines. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian eats. Food delivery apps are all the rage these days, but there's always room for a local pizza slice. The streets are lined with all the necessities: dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco, and even an Indian grocery store. Hearing about other folks' neighborly woes makes me appreciate mine all the more.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a picturesque little town, Johnston, which, while indistinguishable from any other, wields a considerable influence on the agricultural scene. The town is known far and wide as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it proudly flaunts on its welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by sprawling farmlands, with peach groves and cattle ranches being the primary sights. Houses scattered throughout the town are mostly two-story structures, distinguished by either metallic roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are quite remote, often situated far from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. The town's commercial hub is marked by a single traffic light at a major intersection, where the sole retail outlets are located. You'll find three fast food joints: Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once stood here, but it shuttered its doors not long ago. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a locally-owned pharmacy, is known more for its Cherry Coke than anything else. Then there's the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, a pricey little grocery store that serves as the town's only option, though most residents prefer to travel to the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The town's busiest store is Dollar General, stocked with everyday essentials and perpetually bustling with customers. Possibilities Furniture & More is a well-loved local furniture store, complete with movers. Adjacent to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming and boarding facility offering a range of services. Doctors and vets operate out of small, well-equipped practices away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only educational institution; after fifth grade, kids head to the next town for middle and high school. Parks are scarce, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is in the works to provide more leisure and attract visitors. There's a lack of entertainment options: no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots; children's playgrounds or pet walking areas; and a limited selection of restaurants. Despite this, it's a charming town, so small you can zip by in a blink and barely notice it!",
            "The first time I caught wind of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a shock to the system. Rent was astronomical, over a grand a month for just about every apartment in the area. I was clueless, and so were my friends. Guess it's just part of the struggle. A few pals cry themselves to sleep at night, complaining about the costs. But we've adapted over time, embracing the smell of flea market finds and second-hand clothes. The city's scent is a mix of dusty magazines and the damp leather of old records, a smell that clings even after a good wash. There are three thrift stores within walking distance, and if you start on the far side, you can score charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and even a curio shop. Downtown's dense, with cars and people flooding the streets daily, but the stores are peaceful havens. No matter the commotion outside, the thrift is quiet. It's a great spot to kill an afternoon. The city's growing, with e-commerce and delivery empires moving in. It's like New York, everyone's got their own hustle, and no one really asks for much. You can blend in, be quiet, and independent, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you mind your own business, and people do the same. You can keep your shell, and the city will flow around you like waves. It's a lively place, with neighbors who're more like friends. We meet for birthdays, mourn together, and help each other out. I'm lucky to call this place home. I get along with most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself, leave them food, and they return the favor. It's like we're family. I live in a sprawling, impersonal city, but it's the people like these that make me feel like I haven't completely wasted my life.",
            "The place I live can be described as the quintessential cookie cutter suburbia. You know the drill - a homeowner's association in charge, and homes that are all chirpy and neat. Drive in and you'll see manicured lawns, decorative pebbles, and driveways that are more like parking strips. Occasionally, there'll be a tree, but that's rare. Every house has a two-car garage, and the roads are pristine, no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, but you might see a two-story every so often. Mail delivery is handled with a community mailbox system, keyed access mailboxes lined up at the end of the street. Plus, there are package lockers for those who use delivery services. The neighborhood is at the outskirts of a city, so it's a mix of rural and suburban vibes. We've got plenty of land, including community pools and walking trails for dogs and leisurely strolls. The community is geriatric, but there's a sprinkling of young professionals. The city itself? Big by population but small-town charming. We've got all the amenities you'd expect - like a mall that's on the cozy side. It takes about 15 minutes to reach any significant area, and once there, you have your pick of stores, from high-end grocery chains to bargain outlets. The neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty by the book. And while we're not right next to a shopping district, a quick drive gets you there in style.",
            "I'm nestled in a small Midwestern town, just on the outskirts of a major city, in the east side neighborhood that's often overlooked for being the most economically challenged part of town. While property values are low and most homes are occupied by low-income folks, it's not an unpleasant place. Neighbors are generally welcoming, crime rates are higher than other parts of town but generally low, and despite a few violent incidents nearby, my family hasn't been directly affected. The opioid epidemic has hit hard, but there are plenty of resources to help, including rehab centers and Narcan training. My son's elementary school, despite facing special needs, is a positive place, and the PTO keeps things engaging. The school provides free meals to all students, treating everyone equally. While the town has made improvements, they're mainly on the west side where the shopping areas are, leaving the east side somewhat neglected. But overall, it's a town I've come to love, with friendly people, great schools, and a home that, while not worth much, is comfortable. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hotspot, sitting on a hill with buildings steeped in history and a cool arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. The old live Theater is right across the street from my 7-story apartment building, and a block away is a spacious city park encircled by concrete steps. In the cold months, homeless folks set up tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, keeping warm and close to the only family center for miles. The true beauty of my city isn't the historic architecture spattered across the hills leading to the ocean; it's the culture of my people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, still echoes with stories from decades past. The community works hard to keep it clean, and the warning against walking alone after dark is a remnant of those days. I feel at home here, even though it's considered one of the rougher neighborhoods. The people are welcoming, and I've experienced more kindness than expected. They remind me of the resilience of the city and the reminders of systemic issues that still linger. It's a place where strangers offer kindness and where I've felt valued and seen.",
            "I call home Rural America, nestled firmly in small town Michigan. Your journey from my abode takes you through farmlands and quaint tourist cities. Forget grand city malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or even Applebee’s - driving is the only way to get anywhere. Yet, I live in a slice of paradise, encircled by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are my neighbors. Beaches dot the landscape, inviting toes to dip in at every turn. My neighborhood embodies the essence of small town America, with houses that aren't cookie-cutter but rather, unique, some updated, some older. Basements are a common feature, often visible from the road. Aluminum siding, every color imaginable, adorns the houses. Yards are filled with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. This is Middle America: hardworking, family-oriented. Kids, dogs, bikes, and rollerblades are common sights on any given day. Neighbors know neighbors, and everyone fits right in. You might see someone grilling, wave, or catch a neighbor walking their dog with a friendly smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with green grass and well-trimmed plants. While not flashy, it’s a safe, peaceful haven. The county sheriff’s department and jail, health department, city recycling center, baseball fields, softball fields, and airport are within walking distance. An ice cream shop and downtown are just a bike ride away. It’s a great place to live, safe and quiet, perfect for raising a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "If you’re trying to get your head around Portland, Oregon, you gotta start with the phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\". It's more than just a catchy slogan; it's a rallying cry for the Portland of yesteryears, a time when it was less known, less expensive, and brimming with creative eccentricities. To some, it's an invitation to a place where being weird is seen as a compliment. The city's charm hasn't been eroded by the influx of wealthy Californians and their condos, nor by the constant construction that has followed. Portland remains weird, accepting of the unusual, but also holding onto its quirky spirit. It's a place where yoga and hipsters mingle with business professionals, and even the most mundane tasks are approached with a hint of whimsy. Neighborhoods like mine are peppered with colorful houses, home gardens, and free boxes containing treasures that appear like magic to the wandering eye. These boxes are usually filled with clothes and books, but you never know what you might find. The magic of Portland is that it’s a place where anything can happen, a belief shared by people who love goats (yes, goat yoga and Timbers matches), dreamers who hit the town and the bar a little too often, and of course, those who are dealing with drug and mental health issues. Portland's homelessness problem is a reflection of a global issue, and while Portland offers better social services, they struggle to keep up. There's a constant tug-of-war between care and hatred in the crowd. But in this, Portland is just like everywhere else.",

I first moved here for my undergrad, and the mountains north of campus immediately caught my eye.

Explore the area and you'll find Asian shops galore. For the past 20 years or so, Bensonhurt's seen a influx of Asian inhabitants, so expect to pass at least one Asian-owned supermarket or laundromat every block. Locals swear by these places for their quality food, lower prices, and convenience. I've got four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk from my spot, perfect for quick grocery runs. But Bensonhurt's not just Asian. It's a melting pot with immigrants and their kids, and a good chunk of local businesses are Asian-owned.

            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are a rare commodity. The streets slope downwards, and my house perches at the summit of the steepest hill, affectionately dubbed the \"workout hill\" due to the joggers who regularly traverse it. The lack of sidewalks means pedestrians have no choice but to walk on the road, which is marred by potholes and can feel treacherous to drive on. The telephone and electrical wires strung across the block are in poor condition, tattered by the elements. Rain and storms are frequent, and the resultant debris often brings down power lines, leaving them looking like a patchwork quilt. Evergreen trees dot the landscape, but locals despise them, preferring to cut them down as they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill, with spacious glass-fronted second stories to capture the view of the bay. Sunsets are breathtaking, with the water appearing illuminated from below and the sky turning orange. However, it's often overcast, and the view is filtered through a haze. Most days are damp and dreary, with moss growing on everything from rooftops to cars and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and it was covered in green furry moss by the time I returned. It took three hours to scrub it off.\n\nKids are scarce in the neighborhood, but a school is nearby. Most residents are elderly, many retired, and dogs fill the void left by children. They lounge in lawns or race down the street, occasionally sneaking into open homes. Rabbits are a common sight, digging up plant roots and burrowing into lawns, much to the gardeners' dismay. However, my cats have hunted many of them out. Birds are plentiful, ranging from tiny sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle, which is usually chased away by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but a hike downhill leads to a few waterfront restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore provide a fun spot for tossing into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and the opposite shoreline is clearly visible, even through the mist.",
            "I call this place home - a typical southern suburb, nestled between two state highways, so we get the occasional traffic, but the neighborhood is otherwise quiet. We're a neighborhood that sticks together, so everyone knows each other and their cars. We have our routines - yard work, daily chores, winter sledding on the side street. We're a family of four - myself, my wife, and two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. We're often seen coming and going, so we're part of the familiar scenery. There's a rhythm to our days, dictated by the changing seasons. Spring and summer are filled with the hum of lawnmowers, while fall brings the smell of burning leaves. Our backyard is our sanctuary, where we grill, play, and enjoy the shade from the trees. Winter is a bit of a letdown this year, as it feels like a long fall. Our garage is our workshop, a place where I tinker with my truck and keep an ear on the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet here, except for the extra cars parked around during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas. It's a simple life, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

Now, it's pretty much the same, but there are new additions popping up, making it look like a city. The locals are mostly friendly, though like any city, there are good and bad areas. My neck of the woods is filled with friendly old-timers, so it's a pleasant neighborhood. The stores here are mostly chain places like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're after upscale, you'll have to venture out. We're not exactly Whole Foods territory. Construction seems to be the main gig here, with plenty of wide-open spaces for building. It's a bit scary, as I love how things are now. I swapped the big city for this and I'm not keen on going back. My full-time gig is drywall and T-bar installation, right in the middle of it all. One of the cool things about living here is the diverse animals. Folks flock here for the stark beauty of the desert, and the unique ecosystems it creates. Residents should learn about the wildlife to coexist safely. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and they're out there hunting for specimens right now. There are attractions too, like the San Bernardino County Fair, which is a must-visit. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-capped mountains and winter sports. And if you're into natural history, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's packed with geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "When someone asks me to describe my hood, my response is more than a little unusual. While most people picture houses and families, I live in a college campus. My dorm is my home, and my community is the people around me. Even the surrounding campus feels like part of my neighborhood, albeit less so. Despite its unconventionality, my neighborhood shares traits with any standard one. You'll find houses, folk, stores, and parks aplenty. Let's start with the houses that make up my neighborhood, and clarify what they're actually like. There are three types of housing in my immediate area: apartments, houses, and dorms. Apartments house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. Most buildings have 2 floors, so they fit around 20 people. Actual houses are for rent, usually by alumni, and are spread thin. The majority of my neighborhood is dorm-style, with 100s of students living in them. About 2 people share a room, with some exceptions. Now for the people. My school loves diversity, which reflects in the folks living here. Professionals live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. It's hard to truly capture the diversity here, so let's move on to stores and parks. As a self-contained campus, my neighborhood has dining options and unique stores, plus a park where everyone hangs out. It's clean and crime-free thanks to all of us living here!",
            "Considering I've been here for a decade, let me share my experiences. When I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was genuinely bummed. The change was a lot to handle, but my parents wanted the best for me and my sister. The new neighborhood wasn't exactly where I wanted to be, but I adapted and made some friends, and even a few enemies, in school. Over the years, I've grown close to Mr. Glen and his kids, Dennis too, and I consider them part of the family. I was at Mr. Glen's wedding and even caught his wife's garter! I haven't seen Marsharii since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood can be a bit of a labyrinth, but with a GPS, I explore more. I've spent time with Kason and Curtis, playing video games, enjoying nature, and practicing my balance with sticks from Home Depot. There's a basketball and tennis court, too, a reminder of my days learning tennis with Mr. Graves. I've had many fun times here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My pad is in the vicinity of the college I attend, and that's a plus. The neighborhood's mostly apartment buildings, but there are a couple of eateries and bars that are budget-friendly and fun. One bar recently got a new name, but it's pricier, though quality isn't suffering too much. People around here are generally friendly, college kids or lower-income residents since housing is affordable. An elementary school is nearby, so there's plenty of kid action. I don't know my neighbors much, and that's fine with me. They enjoy their weed, and the management's response was to put an air freshener by their door. It's amusing but slightly insulting. The buildings here are mostly old but well-maintained. Further down the road, there are newer apartments, but they're cheaply constructed and overpriced, thanks to their proximity to campus. A nearby restaurant serves meals on paper plates and mostly microwaves its dishes. A gas station is next door, and although it's not great for employees, the city's recent roadwork has improved the area with new sidewalks and greenery. My place is shaded by plenty of trees, and there's a large tree line behind my complex. The street behind me, 43rd, is a bit rougher, with shabby buildings and poor sidewalks. Crime has been an issue, including at nearby complexes. Still, I like living here. It's affordable, and amenities are within walking distance, especially the university. There are also two bus stops nearby, making it easy to get around.",
            "My neighborhood is a string of yellow duplexes with white porches and green roofs, scattered like individual homes along a cul-de-sac. We're not all pals, but most of us are friends, and we enjoy hanging out at the end of our driveways, chatting while the kids play. It's a refreshing break from the modern, tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields, trees, and clear blue skies, but this season's tornado warnings have been a bit scary. Last night, my smallest dog and I took shelter in the bathtub during a storm, while the big one stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, but the hail was heavy. After the storm, the road steamed as the temperature dropped from 92 to 75 degrees. It was surreal to see the hail melt instantly and then watch a double rainbow appear. I snapped some photos to share with friends and family. The streets were quiet for a while before people started to return home. It's a friendly neighborhood, perfect for someone like me who moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else, but the interiors vary. I love the southern accent and the big field behind my place, where I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs sing. I'm fortunate to live in this small community village just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by rooster crows and in the evening, a donkey's bray from a nearby farm. It's a gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I rolled into this hood just as my eighth grade was kicking off. Establishing friendships was a grind initially, but I eventually buddied up with a dude two doors down and another fella on my street. We might not be neighbors anymore, but the memories linger. The original residents are still here, making it feel like a classic American suburban joint. Two-story dwellings and weekends filled with kids' laughter outside are the norm. Weekdays are quiet, except for the odd time when I need a helping hand. Package snatching? Never happened. I trust my neighbors. The park a few minutes away is a treasure trove of nostalgia. I've played soccer, basketball, and baseball there, with memorable highs and lows, like that one football incident. Now it's all about watching my cousin's little ones enjoy the swings and slides. Just thinking about it brings back a flood of memories. The neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures and cuisines. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian eats. Food delivery apps are all the rage these days, but there's always room for a local pizza slice. The streets are lined with all the necessities: dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco, and even an Indian grocery store. Hearing about other folks' neighborly woes makes me appreciate mine all the more.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a picturesque little town, Johnston, which, while indistinguishable from any other, wields a considerable influence on the agricultural scene. The town is known far and wide as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it proudly flaunts on its welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by sprawling farmlands, with peach groves and cattle ranches being the primary sights. Houses scattered throughout the town are mostly two-story structures, distinguished by either metallic roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are quite remote, often situated far from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. The town's commercial hub is marked by a single traffic light at a major intersection, where the sole retail outlets are located. You'll find three fast food joints: Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once stood here, but it shuttered its doors not long ago. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a locally-owned pharmacy, is known more for its Cherry Coke than anything else. Then there's the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, a pricey little grocery store that serves as the town's only option, though most residents prefer to travel to the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The town's busiest store is Dollar General, stocked with everyday essentials and perpetually bustling with customers. Possibilities Furniture & More is a well-loved local furniture store, complete with movers. Adjacent to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming and boarding facility offering a range of services. Doctors and vets operate out of small, well-equipped practices away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only educational institution; after fifth grade, kids head to the next town for middle and high school. Parks are scarce, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is in the works to provide more leisure and attract visitors. There's a lack of entertainment options: no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots; children's playgrounds or pet walking areas; and a limited selection of restaurants. Despite this, it's a charming town, so small you can zip by in a blink and barely notice it!",
            "The first time I caught wind of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a shock to the system. Rent was astronomical, over a grand a month for just about every apartment in the area. I was clueless, and so were my friends. Guess it's just part of the struggle. A few pals cry themselves to sleep at night, complaining about the costs. But we've adapted over time, embracing the smell of flea market finds and second-hand clothes. The city's scent is a mix of dusty magazines and the damp leather of old records, a smell that clings even after a good wash. There are three thrift stores within walking distance, and if you start on the far side, you can score charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and even a curio shop. Downtown's dense, with cars and people flooding the streets daily, but the stores are peaceful havens. No matter the commotion outside, the thrift is quiet. It's a great spot to kill an afternoon. The city's growing, with e-commerce and delivery empires moving in. It's like New York, everyone's got their own hustle, and no one really asks for much. You can blend in, be quiet, and independent, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you mind your own business, and people do the same. You can keep your shell, and the city will flow around you like waves. It's a lively place, with neighbors who're more like friends. We meet for birthdays, mourn together, and help each other out. I'm lucky to call this place home. I get along with most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself, leave them food, and they return the favor. It's like we're family. I live in a sprawling, impersonal city, but it's the people like these that make me feel like I haven't completely wasted my life.",
            "The place I live can be described as the quintessential cookie cutter suburbia. You know the drill - a homeowner's association in charge, and homes that are all chirpy and neat. Drive in and you'll see manicured lawns, decorative pebbles, and driveways that are more like parking strips. Occasionally, there'll be a tree, but that's rare. Every house has a two-car garage, and the roads are pristine, no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, but you might see a two-story every so often. Mail delivery is handled with a community mailbox system, keyed access mailboxes lined up at the end of the street. Plus, there are package lockers for those who use delivery services. The neighborhood is at the outskirts of a city, so it's a mix of rural and suburban vibes. We've got plenty of land, including community pools and walking trails for dogs and leisurely strolls. The community is geriatric, but there's a sprinkling of young professionals. The city itself? Big by population but small-town charming. We've got all the amenities you'd expect - like a mall that's on the cozy side. It takes about 15 minutes to reach any significant area, and once there, you have your pick of stores, from high-end grocery chains to bargain outlets. The neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty by the book. And while we're not right next to a shopping district, a quick drive gets you there in style.",
            "I'm nestled in a small Midwestern town, just on the outskirts of a major city, in the east side neighborhood that's often overlooked for being the most economically challenged part of town. While property values are low and most homes are occupied by low-income folks, it's not an unpleasant place. Neighbors are generally welcoming, crime rates are higher than other parts of town but generally low, and despite a few violent incidents nearby, my family hasn't been directly affected. The opioid epidemic has hit hard, but there are plenty of resources to help, including rehab centers and Narcan training. My son's elementary school, despite facing special needs, is a positive place, and the PTO keeps things engaging. The school provides free meals to all students, treating everyone equally. While the town has made improvements, they're mainly on the west side where the shopping areas are, leaving the east side somewhat neglected. But overall, it's a town I've come to love, with friendly people, great schools, and a home that, while not worth much, is comfortable. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hotspot, sitting on a hill with buildings steeped in history and a cool arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. The old live Theater is right across the street from my 7-story apartment building, and a block away is a spacious city park encircled by concrete steps. In the cold months, homeless folks set up tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, keeping warm and close to the only family center for miles. The true beauty of my city isn't the historic architecture spattered across the hills leading to the ocean; it's the culture of my people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, still echoes with stories from decades past. The community works hard to keep it clean, and the warning against walking alone after dark is a remnant of those days. I feel at home here, even though it's considered one of the rougher neighborhoods. The people are welcoming, and I've experienced more kindness than expected. They remind me of the resilience of the city and the reminders of systemic issues that still linger. It's a place where strangers offer kindness and where I've felt valued and seen.",
            "I call home Rural America, nestled firmly in small town Michigan. Your journey from my abode takes you through farmlands and quaint tourist cities. Forget grand city malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or even Applebee’s - driving is the only way to get anywhere. Yet, I live in a slice of paradise, encircled by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are my neighbors. Beaches dot the landscape, inviting toes to dip in at every turn. My neighborhood embodies the essence of small town America, with houses that aren't cookie-cutter but rather, unique, some updated, some older. Basements are a common feature, often visible from the road. Aluminum siding, every color imaginable, adorns the houses. Yards are filled with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. This is Middle America: hardworking, family-oriented. Kids, dogs, bikes, and rollerblades are common sights on any given day. Neighbors know neighbors, and everyone fits right in. You might see someone grilling, wave, or catch a neighbor walking their dog with a friendly smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with green grass and well-trimmed plants. While not flashy, it’s a safe, peaceful haven. The county sheriff’s department and jail, health department, city recycling center, baseball fields, softball fields, and airport are within walking distance. An ice cream shop and downtown are just a bike ride away. It’s a great place to live, safe and quiet, perfect for raising a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "If you’re trying to get your head around Portland, Oregon, you gotta start with the phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\". It's more than just a catchy slogan; it's a rallying cry for the Portland of yesteryears, a time when it was less known, less expensive, and brimming with creative eccentricities. To some, it's an invitation to a place where being weird is seen as a compliment. The city's charm hasn't been eroded by the influx of wealthy Californians and their condos, nor by the constant construction that has followed. Portland remains weird, accepting of the unusual, but also holding onto its quirky spirit. It's a place where yoga and hipsters mingle with business professionals, and even the most mundane tasks are approached with a hint of whimsy. Neighborhoods like mine are peppered with colorful houses, home gardens, and free boxes containing treasures that appear like magic to the wandering eye. These boxes are usually filled with clothes and books, but you never know what you might find. The magic of Portland is that it’s a place where anything can happen, a belief shared by people who love goats (yes, goat yoga and Timbers matches), dreamers who hit the town and the bar a little too often, and of course, those who are dealing with drug and mental health issues. Portland's homelessness problem is a reflection of a global issue, and while Portland offers better social services, they struggle to keep up. There's a constant tug-of-war between care and hatred in the crowd. But in this, Portland is just like everywhere else.",

I first moved here for my undergrad, and the mountains north of campus immediately caught my eye.

            "Heading to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn? No sweat! Public transport is a breeze and a go-to in NYC. With its urban vibe, you'll feel right at home. Explore the area and you'll find Asian shops galore. For the past 20 years or so, Bensonhurt's seen a influx of Asian inhabitants, so expect to pass at least one Asian-owned supermarket or laundromat every block. Locals swear by these places for their quality food, lower prices, and convenience. I've got four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk from my spot, perfect for quick grocery runs. But Bensonhurt's not just Asian. It's a melting pot with immigrants and their kids, and a good chunk of local businesses are Asian-owned. Plus, there's a newly spruced-up park nearby with ten basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, four handball courts, swings, and a playground. Diverse fun abounds, and it's all within reach. Skip the corporate buildings; it's mostly co-ops and condos here, with two-family houses being the norm. People are generally friendly, but expect some noise—cars blasting tunes, early morning revs, and the occasional ruckus. Nighttime can be dicey, with unpredictable folks and potential trouble.

            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are a rare commodity. The streets slope downwards, and my house perches at the summit of the steepest hill, affectionately dubbed the \"workout hill\" due to the joggers who regularly traverse it. The lack of sidewalks means pedestrians have no choice but to walk on the road, which is marred by potholes and can feel treacherous to drive on. The telephone and electrical wires strung across the block are in poor condition, tattered by the elements. Rain and storms are frequent, and the resultant debris often brings down power lines, leaving them looking like a patchwork quilt. Evergreen trees dot the landscape, but locals despise them, preferring to cut them down as they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill, with spacious glass-fronted second stories to capture the view of the bay. Sunsets are breathtaking, with the water appearing illuminated from below and the sky turning orange. However, it's often overcast, and the view is filtered through a haze. Most days are damp and dreary, with moss growing on everything from rooftops to cars and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and it was covered in green furry moss by the time I returned. It took three hours to scrub it off.\n\nKids are scarce in the neighborhood, but a school is nearby. Most residents are elderly, many retired, and dogs fill the void left by children. They lounge in lawns or race down the street, occasionally sneaking into open homes. Rabbits are a common sight, digging up plant roots and burrowing into lawns, much to the gardeners' dismay. However, my cats have hunted many of them out. Birds are plentiful, ranging from tiny sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle, which is usually chased away by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but a hike downhill leads to a few waterfront restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore provide a fun spot for tossing into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and the opposite shoreline is clearly visible, even through the mist.",
            "I call this place home - a typical southern suburb, nestled between two state highways, so we get the occasional traffic, but the neighborhood is otherwise quiet. We're a neighborhood that sticks together, so everyone knows each other and their cars. We have our routines - yard work, daily chores, winter sledding on the side street. We're a family of four - myself, my wife, and two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. We're often seen coming and going, so we're part of the familiar scenery. There's a rhythm to our days, dictated by the changing seasons. Spring and summer are filled with the hum of lawnmowers, while fall brings the smell of burning leaves. Our backyard is our sanctuary, where we grill, play, and enjoy the shade from the trees. Winter is a bit of a letdown this year, as it feels like a long fall. Our garage is our workshop, a place where I tinker with my truck and keep an ear on the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet here, except for the extra cars parked around during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas. It's a simple life, but I wouldn't have it any other way. If only it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My 'hood's right in the thick of the high desert, where dirt reigns supreme. Unless you've been here, it's hard to grasp the constant brown landscape and the rarity of well-maintained lawns. Back in the 90s, houses were spread out like they were in the wild west. Now, it's pretty much the same, but there are new additions popping up, making it look like a city. The locals are mostly friendly, though like any city, there are good and bad areas. My neck of the woods is filled with friendly old-timers, so it's a pleasant neighborhood. The stores here are mostly chain places like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're after upscale, you'll have to venture out. We're not exactly Whole Foods territory. Construction seems to be the main gig here, with plenty of wide-open spaces for building. It's a bit scary, as I love how things are now. I swapped the big city for this and I'm not keen on going back. My full-time gig is drywall and T-bar installation, right in the middle of it all. One of the cool things about living here is the diverse animals. Folks flock here for the stark beauty of the desert, and the unique ecosystems it creates. Residents should learn about the wildlife to coexist safely. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and they're out there hunting for specimens right now. There are attractions too, like the San Bernardino County Fair, which is a must-visit. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-capped mountains and winter sports. And if you're into natural history, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's packed with geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "When someone asks me to describe my hood, my response is more than a little unusual. While most people picture houses and families, I live in a college campus. My dorm is my home, and my community is the people around me. Even the surrounding campus feels like part of my neighborhood, albeit less so. Despite its unconventionality, my neighborhood shares traits with any standard one. You'll find houses, folk, stores, and parks aplenty. Let's start with the houses that make up my neighborhood, and clarify what they're actually like. There are three types of housing in my immediate area: apartments, houses, and dorms. Apartments house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. Most buildings have 2 floors, so they fit around 20 people. Actual houses are for rent, usually by alumni, and are spread thin. The majority of my neighborhood is dorm-style, with 100s of students living in them. About 2 people share a room, with some exceptions. Now for the people. My school loves diversity, which reflects in the folks living here. Professionals live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. It's hard to truly capture the diversity here, so let's move on to stores and parks. As a self-contained campus, my neighborhood has dining options and unique stores, plus a park where everyone hangs out. It's clean and crime-free thanks to all of us living here!",
            "Considering I've been here for a decade, let me share my experiences. When I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was genuinely bummed. The change was a lot to handle, but my parents wanted the best for me and my sister. The new neighborhood wasn't exactly where I wanted to be, but I adapted and made some friends, and even a few enemies, in school. Over the years, I've grown close to Mr. Glen and his kids, Dennis too, and I consider them part of the family. I was at Mr. Glen's wedding and even caught his wife's garter! I haven't seen Marsharii since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood can be a bit of a labyrinth, but with a GPS, I explore more. I've spent time with Kason and Curtis, playing video games, enjoying nature, and practicing my balance with sticks from Home Depot. There's a basketball and tennis court, too, a reminder of my days learning tennis with Mr. Graves. I've had many fun times here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My pad is in the vicinity of the college I attend, and that's a plus. The neighborhood's mostly apartment buildings, but there are a couple of eateries and bars that are budget-friendly and fun. One bar recently got a new name, but it's pricier, though quality isn't suffering too much. People around here are generally friendly, college kids or lower-income residents since housing is affordable. An elementary school is nearby, so there's plenty of kid action. I don't know my neighbors much, and that's fine with me. They enjoy their weed, and the management's response was to put an air freshener by their door. It's amusing but slightly insulting. The buildings here are mostly old but well-maintained. Further down the road, there are newer apartments, but they're cheaply constructed and overpriced, thanks to their proximity to campus. A nearby restaurant serves meals on paper plates and mostly microwaves its dishes. A gas station is next door, and although it's not great for employees, the city's recent roadwork has improved the area with new sidewalks and greenery. My place is shaded by plenty of trees, and there's a large tree line behind my complex. The street behind me, 43rd, is a bit rougher, with shabby buildings and poor sidewalks. Crime has been an issue, including at nearby complexes. Still, I like living here. It's affordable, and amenities are within walking distance, especially the university. There are also two bus stops nearby, making it easy to get around.",
            "My neighborhood is a string of yellow duplexes with white porches and green roofs, scattered like individual homes along a cul-de-sac. We're not all pals, but most of us are friends, and we enjoy hanging out at the end of our driveways, chatting while the kids play. It's a refreshing break from the modern, tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields, trees, and clear blue skies, but this season's tornado warnings have been a bit scary. Last night, my smallest dog and I took shelter in the bathtub during a storm, while the big one stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, but the hail was heavy. After the storm, the road steamed as the temperature dropped from 92 to 75 degrees. It was surreal to see the hail melt instantly and then watch a double rainbow appear. I snapped some photos to share with friends and family. The streets were quiet for a while before people started to return home. It's a friendly neighborhood, perfect for someone like me who moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else, but the interiors vary. I love the southern accent and the big field behind my place, where I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs sing. I'm fortunate to live in this small community village just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by rooster crows and in the evening, a donkey's bray from a nearby farm. It's a gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I rolled into this hood just as my eighth grade was kicking off. Establishing friendships was a grind initially, but I eventually buddied up with a dude two doors down and another fella on my street. We might not be neighbors anymore, but the memories linger. The original residents are still here, making it feel like a classic American suburban joint. Two-story dwellings and weekends filled with kids' laughter outside are the norm. Weekdays are quiet, except for the odd time when I need a helping hand. Package snatching? Never happened. I trust my neighbors. The park a few minutes away is a treasure trove of nostalgia. I've played soccer, basketball, and baseball there, with memorable highs and lows, like that one football incident. Now it's all about watching my cousin's little ones enjoy the swings and slides. Just thinking about it brings back a flood of memories. The neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures and cuisines. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian eats. Food delivery apps are all the rage these days, but there's always room for a local pizza slice. The streets are lined with all the necessities: dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco, and even an Indian grocery store. Hearing about other folks' neighborly woes makes me appreciate mine all the more.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a picturesque little town, Johnston, which, while indistinguishable from any other, wields a considerable influence on the agricultural scene. The town is known far and wide as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it proudly flaunts on its welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by sprawling farmlands, with peach groves and cattle ranches being the primary sights. Houses scattered throughout the town are mostly two-story structures, distinguished by either metallic roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are quite remote, often situated far from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. The town's commercial hub is marked by a single traffic light at a major intersection, where the sole retail outlets are located. You'll find three fast food joints: Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once stood here, but it shuttered its doors not long ago. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a locally-owned pharmacy, is known more for its Cherry Coke than anything else. Then there's the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, a pricey little grocery store that serves as the town's only option, though most residents prefer to travel to the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The town's busiest store is Dollar General, stocked with everyday essentials and perpetually bustling with customers. Possibilities Furniture & More is a well-loved local furniture store, complete with movers. Adjacent to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming and boarding facility offering a range of services. Doctors and vets operate out of small, well-equipped practices away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only educational institution; after fifth grade, kids head to the next town for middle and high school. Parks are scarce, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is in the works to provide more leisure and attract visitors. There's a lack of entertainment options: no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots; children's playgrounds or pet walking areas; and a limited selection of restaurants. Despite this, it's a charming town, so small you can zip by in a blink and barely notice it!",
            "The first time I caught wind of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a shock to the system. Rent was astronomical, over a grand a month for just about every apartment in the area. I was clueless, and so were my friends. Guess it's just part of the struggle. A few pals cry themselves to sleep at night, complaining about the costs. But we've adapted over time, embracing the smell of flea market finds and second-hand clothes. The city's scent is a mix of dusty magazines and the damp leather of old records, a smell that clings even after a good wash. There are three thrift stores within walking distance, and if you start on the far side, you can score charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and even a curio shop. Downtown's dense, with cars and people flooding the streets daily, but the stores are peaceful havens. No matter the commotion outside, the thrift is quiet. It's a great spot to kill an afternoon. The city's growing, with e-commerce and delivery empires moving in. It's like New York, everyone's got their own hustle, and no one really asks for much. You can blend in, be quiet, and independent, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you mind your own business, and people do the same. You can keep your shell, and the city will flow around you like waves. It's a lively place, with neighbors who're more like friends. We meet for birthdays, mourn together, and help each other out. I'm lucky to call this place home. I get along with most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself, leave them food, and they return the favor. It's like we're family. I live in a sprawling, impersonal city, but it's the people like these that make me feel like I haven't completely wasted my life.",
            "The place I live can be described as the quintessential cookie cutter suburbia. You know the drill - a homeowner's association in charge, and homes that are all chirpy and neat. Drive in and you'll see manicured lawns, decorative pebbles, and driveways that are more like parking strips. Occasionally, there'll be a tree, but that's rare. Every house has a two-car garage, and the roads are pristine, no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, but you might see a two-story every so often. Mail delivery is handled with a community mailbox system, keyed access mailboxes lined up at the end of the street. Plus, there are package lockers for those who use delivery services. The neighborhood is at the outskirts of a city, so it's a mix of rural and suburban vibes. We've got plenty of land, including community pools and walking trails for dogs and leisurely strolls. The community is geriatric, but there's a sprinkling of young professionals. The city itself? Big by population but small-town charming. We've got all the amenities you'd expect - like a mall that's on the cozy side. It takes about 15 minutes to reach any significant area, and once there, you have your pick of stores, from high-end grocery chains to bargain outlets. The neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty by the book. And while we're not right next to a shopping district, a quick drive gets you there in style.",
            "I'm nestled in a small Midwestern town, just on the outskirts of a major city, in the east side neighborhood that's often overlooked for being the most economically challenged part of town. While property values are low and most homes are occupied by low-income folks, it's not an unpleasant place. Neighbors are generally welcoming, crime rates are higher than other parts of town but generally low, and despite a few violent incidents nearby, my family hasn't been directly affected. The opioid epidemic has hit hard, but there are plenty of resources to help, including rehab centers and Narcan training. My son's elementary school, despite facing special needs, is a positive place, and the PTO keeps things engaging. The school provides free meals to all students, treating everyone equally. While the town has made improvements, they're mainly on the west side where the shopping areas are, leaving the east side somewhat neglected. But overall, it's a town I've come to love, with friendly people, great schools, and a home that, while not worth much, is comfortable. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hotspot, sitting on a hill with buildings steeped in history and a cool arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. The old live Theater is right across the street from my 7-story apartment building, and a block away is a spacious city park encircled by concrete steps. In the cold months, homeless folks set up tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, keeping warm and close to the only family center for miles. The true beauty of my city isn't the historic architecture spattered across the hills leading to the ocean; it's the culture of my people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, still echoes with stories from decades past. The community works hard to keep it clean, and the warning against walking alone after dark is a remnant of those days. I feel at home here, even though it's considered one of the rougher neighborhoods. The people are welcoming, and I've experienced more kindness than expected. They remind me of the resilience of the city and the reminders of systemic issues that still linger. It's a place where strangers offer kindness and where I've felt valued and seen.",
            "I call home Rural America, nestled firmly in small town Michigan. Your journey from my abode takes you through farmlands and quaint tourist cities. Forget grand city malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or even Applebee’s - driving is the only way to get anywhere. Yet, I live in a slice of paradise, encircled by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are my neighbors. Beaches dot the landscape, inviting toes to dip in at every turn. My neighborhood embodies the essence of small town America, with houses that aren't cookie-cutter but rather, unique, some updated, some older. Basements are a common feature, often visible from the road. Aluminum siding, every color imaginable, adorns the houses. Yards are filled with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. This is Middle America: hardworking, family-oriented. Kids, dogs, bikes, and rollerblades are common sights on any given day. Neighbors know neighbors, and everyone fits right in. You might see someone grilling, wave, or catch a neighbor walking their dog with a friendly smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with green grass and well-trimmed plants. While not flashy, it’s a safe, peaceful haven. The county sheriff’s department and jail, health department, city recycling center, baseball fields, softball fields, and airport are within walking distance. An ice cream shop and downtown are just a bike ride away. It’s a great place to live, safe and quiet, perfect for raising a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My 'hood is a peculiar one, filled with single-family homes that have been divided into two, still somehow connected. My own crib has a tiny front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It’s a throwback to a time when living in the burbs was the American dream, something that once united us all but now seems to be drifting away. We're still holding onto it, though, with varying degrees of optimism. The upkeep of the yards isn't what it used to be, but the driveways still hold their spots, and the kids are still out there, living in their own world. The old public school, that's been here for nearly a century, still stands, a symbol of the future to the young and a nostalgic reminder to the old.

For some, it's a throwback to Portland's past, a time when it was less known and more affordable, fostering unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come visit, where you might be called weird, but in a good way.

Weird isn't about acceptance, but it is about accepting what's not typically accepted. Like the rest of the country, we buy a lot from China.

I first moved here for college, and the mountains right outside my campus window were the first things that drew me in. Sure, the campus has its own beauty in its architecture and nature, but it's the mountains that hold the power.

            "I reside in a neighborhood where sidewalks are scarce, and the terrain drops rather sharply, with my house perched at the highest point. The locals dub it the \"work out hill\" due to its popularity among joggers. Given the lack of sidewalks, everyone traverses the street, which can be a bit treacherous due to potholes and the occasional hazardous wire. The weather here is rather damp and stormy, with the trees being a constant target for lightning and debris. The neighborhood is a forest of towering evergreens, but the locals seem to have a love-hate relationship with them. They prefer to hack them down to appreciate the ocean view, resulting in many houses built high up the hill with expansive glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets are stunning when the water catches the glow from below and the sky turns a fiery orange, though it's often cloudy, and the view is often marred by a haze. Moss thrives here, coating roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month and it returned as a green, furry beast, requiring hours to clean. Children are few and far between, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is filled with retirees, and dogs often take the place of children. They're common sights in lawns or dashing down the street, sometimes sneaking into open homes. Rabbits roam freely, causing chaos in gardens, but they're a favorite for the cats. Our skies are often filled with birds, from sparrows to eagles and hawks, though they're usually chased away by the neighborhood crows. The nearest amenities are at the waterfront, where a few restaurants serve fresh seafood. The beach isn't much, but the rocky shore is a delight for throwing stones into the water. The bay is narrow, and the opposite shore is visible even through the mist.",
            "We call home a typical southern suburb nestled between two state highways, which means we get a bit more traffic than we'd prefer. But outside of that, it's a quiet neighborhood that's grown familiar over time. Most folks stick to their daily routines—yard work, chores, the occasional walk or bike ride. In winter, we make the most of the hill on our side street for sledding. Our house sits at the corner of the street, offering a prime view of the comings and goings. We're a family of four—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. We work from home, so our presence is as constant as the lawnmowers that hum day in and day out from March to October.\n\nWe've got a thing for Fall here, with trees aplenty, leaves to rake, and the aroma of burning leaves that signals the season. It's become a long Fall this year, with little winter in sight. Our garage is at the back, so we hardly use the front door unless someone rings the bell. I spend my time there working on my truck or other projects, and with the garage doors open, it feels like I'm connected to the rhythm of the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet, but Thanksgiving and the like bring extra cars and visitors from out of town. All said, I'm fond of our little slice of suburbia. If we weren't on a through street, it'd be ideal.",
            "My 'hood's smack dab in the heart of the high desert, which means dirt, dirt, and more dirt. If you've not lived here, you can't really compreh endorsing the constant brown. The only green you see belongs to those who shell out big bucks on lawn care. When I first landed here in the 90s, homes were spread out, and that's still the case today, albeit with some new additions. It's like a city's creeping in, but I suppose the same transformation's happening everywhere. Locals are generally friendly, though, like any city, there's both good and bad. In my neck of the woods, I'm surrounded by pleasant old folks, making it a cozy neighborhood. The shops here are mostly chains - Food4Less, Smart & Final, that sort. You won't find Whole Foods or similar here. The prominent jobs in town are in construction, as this city's still pretty undeveloped and wide open spaces are abundant. That bothers me; I like things just the way they are now. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and my home's got a unique charm with the different critters. People come here for the stark desert beauty, and the high desert climate creates diverse ecosystems. It's crucial for human residents to understand and respect the non-human residents to co-exist peacefully. My kids are lizard and beetle enthusiasts, and we've adapted well to the wildlife. Attractions? There's Victorville for a desert experience, and the San Bernardino County Fair's a must-visit. Plus, the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood are a winter sports lover's dream. For history buffs, check out the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When quizzed about my 'hood, I'm certain my response is a bit peculiar. While others might be homeowners with their own lives, I'm a resident of a college campus, with my dorm as my community. The surrounding campus is my neighborhood, albeit less so. Yet, my 'hood shares similarities with conventional ones - it's got houses, people, shops, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\". There's apartments (2-4 per room, 4-6 rooms per floor, 20-ish people per building), regular houses for affiliated renters, and dorms housing hundreds. Next, the people: my school's diverse makeup echoes in my 'hood. Staff, freshmen, and upperclassmen live in houses, dorms, and apartments, respectively. Moving on, my 'hood has dining options, school-branded clothing and grocery stores, and a crime-free park where everyone plays.",
            "Well, after living here for nearly a decade, I suppose I can share a bit of what I’ve learned. I must admit, I was quite sad when I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a tough transition, but my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we made the move. Our new neighborhood was considered \"not ghetto\" with better housing and a better high school, but it took time to adjust. I made new friends, but also some enemies at school. I eventually got to know our neighbors Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They've been lovely company, almost like family. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding (he re-married) and having a blast. I caught his wife's bouquet, but unfortunately missed the flowers. We danced the night away, and I enjoyed hanging out with his daughter, Marsharii. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but a GPS makes exploration enjoyable. I've only ventured as far as the park where I enjoy nature, and practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken. I also have a basketball and tennis court nearby, though it's been a while since I last played. My dad and Mr. Graves taught me tennis, and we always had fun. There's plenty of stories and moments of joy in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My hood's in close proximity to my college, which is a major plus. It's mostly apartments, but there are a few eats and pours that hit the spot and don't hit the wallet too hard. Just got a new joint down the block—it's pricier now, but quality's not too shabby. Folks are cool, they're mostly students or strapped, as the digs aren't expensive. There's a school just around the corner, so it's chock-full of kids. I'm not really chummy with the neighbors, they're into the green stuff, and the management's gone and stuck an air freshener by their door, which is pretty funny. The buildings are vintage, but they've spruced up the insides. Just down the way, there's a new development, but it's cheaply done and the rent's pricey. The school of hard knocks is just around the corner, with a no-star restaurant serving microwaved grub and a gas station that's not so hot to work at. The city's spruced up the street last year, though, with a big sidewalk, green medians, and all. The tree canopy's thick where I live, with a few stumps here and there, but it's nicer than the street behind me. The 43rd is a mess, sidewalks are falling apart, and buildings look run-down. Crime's a thing over there, but it's not just them—the complex across from me's got its share too. The transit's convenient with two stops nearby, and the uni's within stroll. Plus, the rent's affordable, so I'm good.",
            "My hood's a grid of identical duplexes, each with a yellow facade, white porch, and green metal roof, spaced out like individual houses. Most everyone here is pals with their neighbors. We chill at the end of a makeshift driveway some evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's a refreshing throwback to simpler times, with fields and trees, blue skies, and white clouds—until the recent tornado warnings. Last night, an actual siren alerted us, and I found myself in the bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my big dog stayed in the living room, nervous. The hail was massive, and the temperature dropped from 92 to 75. After the storm, the road was steaming, and a double rainbow appeared. I snapped some pics for my Facebook fam. We're a tight-knit community, but we've all got different-sized apartments. I love walking the big field behind my place and listening to the bullfrog sing in the morning. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Every morning is welcomed by rooster crows, and we've even got a donkey braying in the evening. I was fortunate to stumble upon this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I hit the ground running in this hood just as I hit the big leagues of eighth grade. Making pals wasn't easy at first, but I managed to connect with a buddy two doors down and another guy around my block. They're long gone now, but their presence is still etched in my mind. A lot of the folks who've been here since day one are still around. This neighborhood's got that classic American suburban vibe – two-story homes galore. On warmer days, the kids' laughter echoes through the streets. Most days are peaceful, and my neighbors have been nothing but cool. Once in a while, you'll hear about some unsavory incidents elsewhere, but here, we're all about keeping it real. My porch is a safe haven for packages too – never been snatched, touch wood. There's a park just a hop, skip, and a jump away. It's where I made some unforgettable memories playing ball with the locals. A few bruises and a busted nose came from it too, but the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I take the little ones from my cousin's for park visits. seeing them lose their minds on the swings triggers a wave of nostalgia. This neighborhood is a melting pot – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian eats, all within a mile. Food delivery's the new norm, but the classics like pizza and fast food are as ubiquitous as ever. The stores here are stocked with everything under the sun – dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store that's a Midwest staple. Even an Indian store popped up for a change of pace. All in all, I'm stoked to call this place home. Seeing the news and social media, you'd think the world's gone to the dogs, but my neighborhood's still got love to spare.",
            "My little town in South Carolina is nothing extraordinary, but it's got a big claim to fame in the agriculture world. It's the Peach Capital of the World, with farmland stretched out for miles, filled with peach orchards and cattle. The houses here are mostly two-story, with metal or gray shingle roofs, and they're spaced out, with plenty of room for animals and crops. The town center has a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the only shops. There's a small Chinese restaurant, a Mexican place, a burger joint, and a now-closed pizzeria. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a tiny family pharmacy known for its Cherry Coke, and there's an IGA grocery store for the basics, though many folks hit Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for more. Dollar General is the big attraction, packed from dawn till dusk. There's a long-standing furniture store run by a friendly lady, with movers to help deliver your purchase. Next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet grooming and boarding. Both the doctor's and vet's offices are a bit out of town but well-equipped. There's a single elementary school, and students head to the next town for middle and high school. The lack of parks is being addressed, with a new 2.5-acre recreational area in the works. As for entertainment, there's no movie theater or bowling alley, but it's a cozy town where you can pass right through without noticing.",
            "I first stumbled upon the story of my place while listening to a podcast about missing persons. Quite the shocker, considering every apartment in the neighborhood was listed for over a thousand bucks a month. None of my friends or I had even heard about it. Guess it's the struggle, right? A few of my pals even admitted to crying themselves to sleep at night. Expenses are through the roof, but we've gotten good at being frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty aroma of flea market trinkets and vintage clothes. Smells a lot less in adulthood, unless you're into the \"grown-up\" scent. Maybe it's the smoke, maybe it's just the state of things. But the thrift stores always draw me in. The scent of dusty magazines on a closed piano wedges itself into the leather and sticks around, even after a good wash. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but it's a different story inside the stores—silent and serene. A great spot to kill an afternoon. With each passing year, the city's only getting more crowded. Cars and people are flooding the streets, and it's all part of its growing pains. I've been living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's the friendly neighbors that make it feel like I haven't totally botched my life. I've got a knack for cleaning up after myself and leaving food for my neighbors, and they do the same in return. We take care of each other—bringing each other mail, celebrating birthdays, and mourning funerals. The pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs ensure there's always some music in the air. It's a lively place to be. I'm lucky to have a community of friendly neighbors. We treat each other well and make sure to keep our shell, and the city rolls along like waves on the beach. I've got the dusty smell of adulthood, the silent thrift stores, and the friendly neighbors to keep me company in this sprawl.",
            "My locale is a classic cookie-cutter suburbia, with a strong homeowner's association presence. Upon entering, you'll see pristine single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's vigilant maintenance. The front yards are uniform, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, often featuring small trees. Every house has a two-car garage, and the streets are immaculately paved. There are no individual mailboxes; instead, everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox in a large grouping at the end of the street, with two larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is a blend of rural and suburban, with plenty of land for community pools and walking trails. Most residents are retired, with a sprinkling of middle-aged and young professionals. The city is surprisingly populous but has a small-town vibe. Amenities abound, including a mall that caters to organic food lovers and bargain hunters alike. It takes about 15 minutes to reach significant attractions, but once there, you'll find a wide range of stores. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained area with plenty of nice things like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to major shopping, it's easily accessible by car.",
            "I call the small Midwestern town where I dwell my home, but it's a place that's just outside the urban sprawl of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, nestled on the east side of town, is the most economically challenged area. It's a low-value neighborhood, with most homes rented or owned by those on limited incomes. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place to live. The neighbors are quite friendly, offering warm smiles and hellos as I stroll down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher, are still relatively low. We've had our share of violent incidents, like a few shootings and a homicide in the past decade within a few blocks. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family hasn't been directly impacted, aside from the occasional porch theft. Our town has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic, with many lives claimed by fentanyl overdoses. But we've got resources to combat this, including rehab centers and Narcan training for families and friends. Despite these challenges, there are plenty of positives. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with great staff who've ensured he hasn't faced any bullying. We have an active PTO planning annual events, and the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students. The town council has made improvements, but these are mainly in the city center and the west side, where most shopping and traffic are. The east side, where I live, often feels neglected. Yet, we love our home; it's comfortable and adequate. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hub nestled on a hill, surrounded by historic structures. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and just a block away, there's this awesome arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Lines often form, especially on weekends in June and July. A few blocks up, we have our city park, quite large for the area. Concrete walls surround it, with tall steps leading up. During winter, homeless folks set up tents in rows along the sidewalk and steps, huddled together for warmth. Rain, not snow, is our harsh winter visitor, making it tough to stay warm. Their tents are close to the family center for miles around, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my neighborhood isn't the historic buildings or the architecture, but the spirit of its people. Once infamous for gang violence, the Hilltop still bears its past, and stories are passed down generation to generation. People work hard to maintain it, and they care deeply about their community. You're warned not to walk around after dark if you're white, a reminder of old days and social conditioning. I'm dark enough to get by, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, aware of the reminders of racism and fear. No matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who offer help without asking for something in return. It's a place where laundromat owners extend their hours to let me charge my phone when caught in the rain. It's a place where I've felt invisible, huddled against storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop and give me a $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I hail from the heart of rural America, smack dab in the middle of small-town Michigan. From here, you're a stone's throw from miles of farmland and quaint tourist destinations, but you won't find any big city amenities. No sprawling malls, no Wal-mart or Target, not even an Applebee’s nearby. To get anywhere, you've got to hop in the car. Despite the drive, I live in one of the most breathtaking spots on earth, surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every direction you turn, there's a beach waiting for your toes. My 'city' is a quintessential small town. Houses aren't stacked like towers, but rather spaced out. They're unique, not cookie-cutter, and often feature older aluminum siding. Some are updated, others are time-worn, but all have full basements visible from the road. Most homes have yards, with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for the occasional animal. The houses are a snapshot of Middle America - hardworking folks raising families or having raised them. Kids run up and down the streets, people walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors know each other, and you can spot the outsiders. You'll hear grilling outside and pleasant smiles from passersby. The lawns are well-maintained, with no leaves from last fall and green grass under control. This isn't a fancy neighborhood, but it's perfect for families. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While average-looking, it's exceptional for what it represents - a place where people can feel safe and secure. Just around the corner, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department, the city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, and a small airport. You can hear the hum of small planes taking off and landing while playing outside or inside. A leisurely bike ride or walk to the local ice cream shop is no problem, and even the park is just a short distance away. It's a fantastic place to call home, really."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, with a wide range of businesses—a mix of offices, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. New eateries and stores are prevalent, from well-known brand names to trendy boutiques, which line the streets near quiet neighborhoods. There are a couple of nearby parks that draw families with young kids.

However, navigating those distances can be daunting, with traffic often turning a short 10-mile drive into a two-hour journey.

            "My 'hood is a peculiar one, filled with single-family homes that have been divided into two, still somehow connected. My own crib has a tiny front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It’s a throwback to a time when living in the burbs was the American dream, something that once united us all but now seems to be drifting away. We're still holding onto it, though, with varying degrees of optimism. The upkeep of the yards isn't what it used to be, but the driveways still hold their spots, and the kids are still out there, living in their own world. The old public school, that's been here for nearly a century, still stands, a symbol of the future to the young and a nostalgic reminder to the old. The churches are few, the basketball courts are packed, and each house has its unique charm. There's a supermarket run by a Yemeni family, probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The locals are mostly African American, and the streets are wide enough for the kids to play football, stopping only when a car needs to pass. Generations of families have called this place home, and they've got stories galore from when everyone knew everyone. Once there was a karate school, but Hollywood's lack of karate kid flicks killed that business, so it's now a pharmacy, because, you know, drugs are the answer. There's an old movie theater that screens classic flicks, shunned by the youth but beloved by the old-timers. There's a single expressway cutting through our town, with its exit and entrance in the neighboring town. We once petitioned for our own exit, but the elders shot it down, saying it would ruin the town. Now, they're building a new high school, and we're debating on a mascot.

As we head to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always out and about, mowing his lawn and singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he’s always genuine and has a fascinating history. He’s gotten older and has lost some of his wit, but he was once a doctor. He blends in with the grass and his mower most days. Continuing down the road, you’ll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are aplenty and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry. You’ll hear bullfrogs, the stream’s gurgle, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to “hunting” animals (which mostly involved chasing them), there was always something to do, and a neighborhood kid to join in. Our winters can be brutal, but there’s nothing more enchanting. The yard transforms from a sea of green to a winter wonderland. The vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers of summer morph into barren tree skeletons. When snow falls, it blankets the landscape overnight. The backyard is a winter wonderland of snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister, and our snowballs were our weapons of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts stocked with branches, like a winter arsenal. In our frozen wonderland, we played pretend, untroubled by the world beyond.",
            "The very first thing you need to grasp about Portland, Oregon is its reputation for being, well, weird. The city's unofficial motto, scrawled on the side of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and barely clings to the law with half its endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a throwback to Portland's past, a time when it was less known and more affordable, fostering unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come visit, where you might be called weird, but in a good way. Despite the influx of rich Californians and the endless construction of condos to house them, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't about acceptance, but it is about accepting what's not typically accepted. Like the rest of the country, we buy a lot from China. There are countless ways to be not like everyone else, and Portland has no shortage of normals. We've got yoga and hipsters and business folks. Maybe weird just means we take all this a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others, you'll find colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes? They're cardboard or plastic containers filled with stuff someone's tossing, and they often contain treasures. Clothes, books, who knows what? The magic of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland's all about. To me, anyway. Portland's all about dreams and dreams about dreams, and maybe a bit too much time at the bar. Portland's not perfect, it's got a drug problem, a homelessness issue, and a climate that can be pretty dreary. The rain and the clouds aren't helping. Portland's homeless are drawn by our social services, but not everyone knows what to do about them. The non-homeless? We're a mix of care and hatred. Here, we're not weird at all.",
            "There's this constant backdrop to my life, these mountains that stand sentinel in the north. They've been there from the start, whether I notice them or not. When I'm stressed out and drowning in work or life, they call out to me, and when I turn to them, they let my anxious heart find some calm. I first moved here for college, and the mountains right outside my campus window were the first things that drew me in. Sure, the campus has its own beauty in its architecture and nature, but it's the mountains that hold the power. The town itself is a mix of charming cafes and the bustle of a downtown area, like a small town that's also got the heart of a city. The change between the two is stark, like a call to explore and find your own rhythm. There are good memories here, like late-night walks with friends or movie nights, but also tough times, like those crying sessions in the middle of the night. Yet, even in those moments, the mountains are there, steady and solid, helping me find my way forward, one step at a time. When I look up at the sunrise, they're always there, painting the sky, a symbol of strength and resilience. They're the silent guardians, the constant reminder that I can press on, no matter what life throws at me.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, finding your way won't be an issue—public transportation is easily accessible and a go-to in NYC. Bensonhurt is packed with Asian stores, a result of the neighborhood's growing Asian population over the past two decades. Every block has at least one Asian-owned business, and supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular. Locals swear by the food quality and cheaper prices at these stores. In fact, four Asian supermarkets are within walking distance of where I live, making grocery shopping a breeze. But Bensonhurt isn't solely Asian—it's diverse with immigrants and their children too. Many local businesses, even popular ones, are Asian-owned, and a recently renovated park nearby offers basketball, soccer/football, and handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain. NYC parks are always diverse, and Bensonhurt is no exception.\n\nBensonhurt doesn't have many corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-ops, condos, and two-family houses. The neighborhood is generally friendly, though it can be noisy, especially with music blasting from passing cars and constant early morning driving. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with potential for trouble from bullies and thieves. I've had my share of experiences here, including physical assault and package theft. Dog waste is a constant issue, despite NYC's fine for not cleaning up. You'll see dog waste daily as you walk to the train or supermarket. My biggest gripe? Dog waste everywhere. Keep your shoes clean and be careful!",
            "I reside in a neighborhood where sidewalks are scarce, and the terrain drops rather sharply, with my house perched at the highest point. The locals dub it the \"work out hill\" due to its popularity among joggers. Given the lack of sidewalks, everyone traverses the street, which can be a bit treacherous due to potholes and the occasional hazardous wire. The weather here is rather damp and stormy, with the trees being a constant target for lightning and debris. The neighborhood is a forest of towering evergreens, but the locals seem to have a love-hate relationship with them. They prefer to hack them down to appreciate the ocean view, resulting in many houses built high up the hill with expansive glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets are stunning when the water catches the glow from below and the sky turns a fiery orange, though it's often cloudy, and the view is often marred by a haze. Moss thrives here, coating roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month and it returned as a green, furry beast, requiring hours to clean. Children are few and far between, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is filled with retirees, and dogs often take the place of children. They're common sights in lawns or dashing down the street, sometimes sneaking into open homes. Rabbits roam freely, causing chaos in gardens, but they're a favorite for the cats. Our skies are often filled with birds, from sparrows to eagles and hawks, though they're usually chased away by the neighborhood crows. The nearest amenities are at the waterfront, where a few restaurants serve fresh seafood. The beach isn't much, but the rocky shore is a delight for throwing stones into the water. The bay is narrow, and the opposite shore is visible even through the mist.",
            "We call home a typical southern suburb nestled between two state highways, which means we get a bit more traffic than we'd prefer. But outside of that, it's a quiet neighborhood that's grown familiar over time. Most folks stick to their daily routines—yard work, chores, the occasional walk or bike ride. In winter, we make the most of the hill on our side street for sledding. Our house sits at the corner of the street, offering a prime view of the comings and goings. We're a family of four—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. We work from home, so our presence is as constant as the lawnmowers that hum day in and day out from March to October.\n\nWe've got a thing for Fall here, with trees aplenty, leaves to rake, and the aroma of burning leaves that signals the season. It's become a long Fall this year, with little winter in sight. Our garage is at the back, so we hardly use the front door unless someone rings the bell. I spend my time there working on my truck or other projects, and with the garage doors open, it feels like I'm connected to the rhythm of the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet, but Thanksgiving and the like bring extra cars and visitors from out of town. All said, I'm fond of our little slice of suburbia. If we weren't on a through street, it'd be ideal.",
            "My 'hood's smack dab in the heart of the high desert, which means dirt, dirt, and more dirt. If you've not lived here, you can't really compreh endorsing the constant brown. The only green you see belongs to those who shell out big bucks on lawn care. When I first landed here in the 90s, homes were spread out, and that's still the case today, albeit with some new additions. It's like a city's creeping in, but I suppose the same transformation's happening everywhere. Locals are generally friendly, though, like any city, there's both good and bad. In my neck of the woods, I'm surrounded by pleasant old folks, making it a cozy neighborhood. The shops here are mostly chains - Food4Less, Smart & Final, that sort. You won't find Whole Foods or similar here. The prominent jobs in town are in construction, as this city's still pretty undeveloped and wide open spaces are abundant. That bothers me; I like things just the way they are now. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and my home's got a unique charm with the different critters. People come here for the stark desert beauty, and the high desert climate creates diverse ecosystems. It's crucial for human residents to understand and respect the non-human residents to co-exist peacefully. My kids are lizard and beetle enthusiasts, and we've adapted well to the wildlife. Attractions? There's Victorville for a desert experience, and the San Bernardino County Fair's a must-visit. Plus, the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood are a winter sports lover's dream. For history buffs, check out the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When quizzed about my 'hood, I'm certain my response is a bit peculiar. While others might be homeowners with their own lives, I'm a resident of a college campus, with my dorm as my community. The surrounding campus is my neighborhood, albeit less so. Yet, my 'hood shares similarities with conventional ones - it's got houses, people, shops, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\". There's apartments (2-4 per room, 4-6 rooms per floor, 20-ish people per building), regular houses for affiliated renters, and dorms housing hundreds. Next, the people: my school's diverse makeup echoes in my 'hood. Staff, freshmen, and upperclassmen live in houses, dorms, and apartments, respectively. Moving on, my 'hood has dining options, school-branded clothing and grocery stores, and a crime-free park where everyone plays.",
            "Well, after living here for nearly a decade, I suppose I can share a bit of what I’ve learned. I must admit, I was quite sad when I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a tough transition, but my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we made the move. Our new neighborhood was considered \"not ghetto\" with better housing and a better high school, but it took time to adjust. I made new friends, but also some enemies at school. I eventually got to know our neighbors Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They've been lovely company, almost like family. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding (he re-married) and having a blast. I caught his wife's bouquet, but unfortunately missed the flowers. We danced the night away, and I enjoyed hanging out with his daughter, Marsharii. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but a GPS makes exploration enjoyable. I've only ventured as far as the park where I enjoy nature, and practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken. I also have a basketball and tennis court nearby, though it's been a while since I last played. My dad and Mr. Graves taught me tennis, and we always had fun. There's plenty of stories and moments of joy in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My hood's in close proximity to my college, which is a major plus. It's mostly apartments, but there are a few eats and pours that hit the spot and don't hit the wallet too hard. Just got a new joint down the block—it's pricier now, but quality's not too shabby. Folks are cool, they're mostly students or strapped, as the digs aren't expensive. There's a school just around the corner, so it's chock-full of kids. I'm not really chummy with the neighbors, they're into the green stuff, and the management's gone and stuck an air freshener by their door, which is pretty funny. The buildings are vintage, but they've spruced up the insides. Just down the way, there's a new development, but it's cheaply done and the rent's pricey. The school of hard knocks is just around the corner, with a no-star restaurant serving microwaved grub and a gas station that's not so hot to work at. The city's spruced up the street last year, though, with a big sidewalk, green medians, and all. The tree canopy's thick where I live, with a few stumps here and there, but it's nicer than the street behind me. The 43rd is a mess, sidewalks are falling apart, and buildings look run-down. Crime's a thing over there, but it's not just them—the complex across from me's got its share too. The transit's convenient with two stops nearby, and the uni's within stroll. Plus, the rent's affordable, so I'm good.",
            "My hood's a grid of identical duplexes, each with a yellow facade, white porch, and green metal roof, spaced out like individual houses. Most everyone here is pals with their neighbors. We chill at the end of a makeshift driveway some evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's a refreshing throwback to simpler times, with fields and trees, blue skies, and white clouds—until the recent tornado warnings. Last night, an actual siren alerted us, and I found myself in the bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my big dog stayed in the living room, nervous. The hail was massive, and the temperature dropped from 92 to 75. After the storm, the road was steaming, and a double rainbow appeared. I snapped some pics for my Facebook fam. We're a tight-knit community, but we've all got different-sized apartments. I love walking the big field behind my place and listening to the bullfrog sing in the morning. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Every morning is welcomed by rooster crows, and we've even got a donkey braying in the evening. I was fortunate to stumble upon this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I hit the ground running in this hood just as I hit the big leagues of eighth grade. Making pals wasn't easy at first, but I managed to connect with a buddy two doors down and another guy around my block. They're long gone now, but their presence is still etched in my mind. A lot of the folks who've been here since day one are still around. This neighborhood's got that classic American suburban vibe – two-story homes galore. On warmer days, the kids' laughter echoes through the streets. Most days are peaceful, and my neighbors have been nothing but cool. Once in a while, you'll hear about some unsavory incidents elsewhere, but here, we're all about keeping it real. My porch is a safe haven for packages too – never been snatched, touch wood. There's a park just a hop, skip, and a jump away. It's where I made some unforgettable memories playing ball with the locals. A few bruises and a busted nose came from it too, but the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I take the little ones from my cousin's for park visits. seeing them lose their minds on the swings triggers a wave of nostalgia. This neighborhood is a melting pot – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian eats, all within a mile. Food delivery's the new norm, but the classics like pizza and fast food are as ubiquitous as ever. The stores here are stocked with everything under the sun – dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store that's a Midwest staple. Even an Indian store popped up for a change of pace. All in all, I'm stoked to call this place home. Seeing the news and social media, you'd think the world's gone to the dogs, but my neighborhood's still got love to spare.",
            "My little town in South Carolina is nothing extraordinary, but it's got a big claim to fame in the agriculture world. It's the Peach Capital of the World, with farmland stretched out for miles, filled with peach orchards and cattle. The houses here are mostly two-story, with metal or gray shingle roofs, and they're spaced out, with plenty of room for animals and crops. The town center has a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the only shops. There's a small Chinese restaurant, a Mexican place, a burger joint, and a now-closed pizzeria. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a tiny family pharmacy known for its Cherry Coke, and there's an IGA grocery store for the basics, though many folks hit Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for more. Dollar General is the big attraction, packed from dawn till dusk. There's a long-standing furniture store run by a friendly lady, with movers to help deliver your purchase. Next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet grooming and boarding. Both the doctor's and vet's offices are a bit out of town but well-equipped. There's a single elementary school, and students head to the next town for middle and high school. The lack of parks is being addressed, with a new 2.5-acre recreational area in the works. As for entertainment, there's no movie theater or bowling alley, but it's a cozy town where you can pass right through without noticing.",
            "I first stumbled upon the story of my place while listening to a podcast about missing persons. Quite the shocker, considering every apartment in the neighborhood was listed for over a thousand bucks a month. None of my friends or I had even heard about it. Guess it's the struggle, right? A few of my pals even admitted to crying themselves to sleep at night. Expenses are through the roof, but we've gotten good at being frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty aroma of flea market trinkets and vintage clothes. Smells a lot less in adulthood, unless you're into the \"grown-up\" scent. Maybe it's the smoke, maybe it's just the state of things. But the thrift stores always draw me in. The scent of dusty magazines on a closed piano wedges itself into the leather and sticks around, even after a good wash. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but it's a different story inside the stores—silent and serene. A great spot to kill an afternoon. With each passing year, the city's only getting more crowded. Cars and people are flooding the streets, and it's all part of its growing pains. I've been living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's the friendly neighbors that make it feel like I haven't totally botched my life. I've got a knack for cleaning up after myself and leaving food for my neighbors, and they do the same in return. We take care of each other—bringing each other mail, celebrating birthdays, and mourning funerals. The pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs ensure there's always some music in the air. It's a lively place to be. I'm lucky to have a community of friendly neighbors. We treat each other well and make sure to keep our shell, and the city rolls along like waves on the beach. I've got the dusty smell of adulthood, the silent thrift stores, and the friendly neighbors to keep me company in this sprawl.",
            "My locale is a classic cookie-cutter suburbia, with a strong homeowner's association presence. Upon entering, you'll see pristine single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's vigilant maintenance. The front yards are uniform, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, often featuring small trees. Every house has a two-car garage, and the streets are immaculately paved. There are no individual mailboxes; instead, everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox in a large grouping at the end of the street, with two larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is a blend of rural and suburban, with plenty of land for community pools and walking trails. Most residents are retired, with a sprinkling of middle-aged and young professionals. The city is surprisingly populous but has a small-town vibe. Amenities abound, including a mall that caters to organic food lovers and bargain hunters alike. It takes about 15 minutes to reach significant attractions, but once there, you'll find a wide range of stores. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained area with plenty of nice things like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to major shopping, it's easily accessible by car.",
            "I call the small Midwestern town where I dwell my home, but it's a place that's just outside the urban sprawl of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, nestled on the east side of town, is the most economically challenged area. It's a low-value neighborhood, with most homes rented or owned by those on limited incomes. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place to live. The neighbors are quite friendly, offering warm smiles and hellos as I stroll down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher, are still relatively low. We've had our share of violent incidents, like a few shootings and a homicide in the past decade within a few blocks. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family hasn't been directly impacted, aside from the occasional porch theft. Our town has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic, with many lives claimed by fentanyl overdoses. But we've got resources to combat this, including rehab centers and Narcan training for families and friends. Despite these challenges, there are plenty of positives. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with great staff who've ensured he hasn't faced any bullying. We have an active PTO planning annual events, and the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students. The town council has made improvements, but these are mainly in the city center and the west side, where most shopping and traffic are. The east side, where I live, often feels neglected. Yet, we love our home; it's comfortable and adequate. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hub nestled on a hill, surrounded by historic structures. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and just a block away, there's this awesome arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Lines often form, especially on weekends in June and July. A few blocks up, we have our city park, quite large for the area. Concrete walls surround it, with tall steps leading up. During winter, homeless folks set up tents in rows along the sidewalk and steps, huddled together for warmth. Rain, not snow, is our harsh winter visitor, making it tough to stay warm. Their tents are close to the family center for miles around, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my neighborhood isn't the historic buildings or the architecture, but the spirit of its people. Once infamous for gang violence, the Hilltop still bears its past, and stories are passed down generation to generation. People work hard to maintain it, and they care deeply about their community. You're warned not to walk around after dark if you're white, a reminder of old days and social conditioning. I'm dark enough to get by, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, aware of the reminders of racism and fear. No matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who offer help without asking for something in return. It's a place where laundromat owners extend their hours to let me charge my phone when caught in the rain. It's a place where I've felt invisible, huddled against storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop and give me a $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I hail from the heart of rural America, smack dab in the middle of small-town Michigan. From here, you're a stone's throw from miles of farmland and quaint tourist destinations, but you won't find any big city amenities. No sprawling malls, no Wal-mart or Target, not even an Applebee’s nearby. To get anywhere, you've got to hop in the car. Despite the drive, I live in one of the most breathtaking spots on earth, surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every direction you turn, there's a beach waiting for your toes. My 'city' is a quintessential small town. Houses aren't stacked like towers, but rather spaced out. They're unique, not cookie-cutter, and often feature older aluminum siding. Some are updated, others are time-worn, but all have full basements visible from the road. Most homes have yards, with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for the occasional animal. The houses are a snapshot of Middle America - hardworking folks raising families or having raised them. Kids run up and down the streets, people walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors know each other, and you can spot the outsiders. You'll hear grilling outside and pleasant smiles from passersby. The lawns are well-maintained, with no leaves from last fall and green grass under control. This isn't a fancy neighborhood, but it's perfect for families. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While average-looking, it's exceptional for what it represents - a place where people can feel safe and secure. Just around the corner, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department, the city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, and a small airport. You can hear the hum of small planes taking off and landing while playing outside or inside. A leisurely bike ride or walk to the local ice cream shop is no problem, and even the park is just a short distance away. It's a fantastic place to call home, really."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a sprawling city, my neighborhood is a vibrant tapestry of diversity. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, with a wide range of businesses—a mix of offices, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. New eateries and stores are prevalent, from well-known brand names to trendy boutiques, which line the streets near quiet neighborhoods. There are a couple of nearby parks that draw families with young kids.

Just a bit further out, you'll find enclaves of various races and nationalities—Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and more—all within a few miles. However, navigating those distances can be daunting, with traffic often turning a short 10-mile drive into a two-hour journey. Not many folks walk around, but there are plenty of parking woes and massive traffic congestion. Despite recent construction adding new apartment buildings, residents are divided on welcoming more people and cars. Housing options vary from grand apartments to smaller homes and duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood.

It's not the tightest community these days, but it's diverse and ever-changing.",
            "My 'hood is a peculiar one, filled with single-family homes that have been divided into two, still somehow connected. My own crib has a tiny front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It’s a throwback to a time when living in the burbs was the American dream, something that once united us all but now seems to be drifting away. We're still holding onto it, though, with varying degrees of optimism. The upkeep of the yards isn't what it used to be, but the driveways still hold their spots, and the kids are still out there, living in their own world. The old public school, that's been here for nearly a century, still stands, a symbol of the future to the young and a nostalgic reminder to the old. The churches are few, the basketball courts are packed, and each house has its unique charm. There's a supermarket run by a Yemeni family, probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The locals are mostly African American, and the streets are wide enough for the kids to play football, stopping only when a car needs to pass. Generations of families have called this place home, and they've got stories galore from when everyone knew everyone. Once there was a karate school, but Hollywood's lack of karate kid flicks killed that business, so it's now a pharmacy, because, you know, drugs are the answer. There's an old movie theater that screens classic flicks, shunned by the youth but beloved by the old-timers. There's a single expressway cutting through our town, with its exit and entrance in the neighboring town. We once petitioned for our own exit, but the elders shot it down, saying it would ruin the town. Now, they're building a new high school, and we're debating on a mascot. I say a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin. What do you think?",

At least, not anywhere worth visiting. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels that only come to life during summer reunions, you'll discover a thriving community. Nestled among these communities are several apartment complexes, stacked neatly like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and lined up along the road. The first complexes you encounter have been in the news for unsavory reasons, but we won't dwell on them. Instead, focus on the complexes beside those, and the ones beside them.

The center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that churns the thick, warm summer air. Kids run around in the park, cartwheeling and pinwheeling through the prickly grass, while retired folks walk their dogs, scowling at the teens on skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls gossiping about boys and YouTube sensations. A sushi place in the strip mall by the park offers cheap food but isn't usually crowded - next to it is a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat hibachi chicken all at once - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt place where teens often grab cold, sweating cups of yogurt topped with whatever they fancy, using their skateboards and vaping as they do stunts. This neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana, a piece of history in the sleepy south where not much changes, not even time itself.",
            "“Where the heck is everything?” she asked as we zipped past endless cornfields sprawling out as far as the eye could see. “This is it!” I replied, knowing she’d be blown away by the vast openness. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a mere 5-minute stroll from her place—she’d never seen such open space before. Awestruck by the omnipresent cornfields, I regaled her with tales of growing up in rural Ohio, and right then, she understood who I was and whence I came. Cruising down a two-lane country road, you’ll hit a quarry teeming with water. Beyond that, you’ll find the quiet development where I live. The homes are mostly brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in tending to. In springtime, the place bursts with annual flowers and the ever-changing hues of midwestern trees. The driveways are lined with top-notch Mercedes Benzes that gleam in the midday sun post a thorough car wash. As we head to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always out and about, mowing his lawn and singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he’s always genuine and has a fascinating history. He’s gotten older and has lost some of his wit, but he was once a doctor. He blends in with the grass and his mower most days. Continuing down the road, you’ll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are aplenty and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry. You’ll hear bullfrogs, the stream’s gurgle, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to “hunting” animals (which mostly involved chasing them), there was always something to do, and a neighborhood kid to join in. Our winters can be brutal, but there’s nothing more enchanting. The yard transforms from a sea of green to a winter wonderland. The vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers of summer morph into barren tree skeletons. When snow falls, it blankets the landscape overnight. The backyard is a winter wonderland of snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister, and our snowballs were our weapons of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts stocked with branches, like a winter arsenal. In our frozen wonderland, we played pretend, untroubled by the world beyond.",
            "The very first thing you need to grasp about Portland, Oregon is its reputation for being, well, weird. The city's unofficial motto, scrawled on the side of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and barely clings to the law with half its endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a throwback to Portland's past, a time when it was less known and more affordable, fostering unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come visit, where you might be called weird, but in a good way. Despite the influx of rich Californians and the endless construction of condos to house them, Portland remains weird. Weird isn't about acceptance, but it is about accepting what's not typically accepted. Like the rest of the country, we buy a lot from China. There are countless ways to be not like everyone else, and Portland has no shortage of normals. We've got yoga and hipsters and business folks. Maybe weird just means we take all this a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others, you'll find colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes? They're cardboard or plastic containers filled with stuff someone's tossing, and they often contain treasures. Clothes, books, who knows what? The magic of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland's all about. To me, anyway. Portland's all about dreams and dreams about dreams, and maybe a bit too much time at the bar. Portland's not perfect, it's got a drug problem, a homelessness issue, and a climate that can be pretty dreary. The rain and the clouds aren't helping. Portland's homeless are drawn by our social services, but not everyone knows what to do about them. The non-homeless? We're a mix of care and hatred. Here, we're not weird at all.",
            "There's this constant backdrop to my life, these mountains that stand sentinel in the north. They've been there from the start, whether I notice them or not. When I'm stressed out and drowning in work or life, they call out to me, and when I turn to them, they let my anxious heart find some calm. I first moved here for college, and the mountains right outside my campus window were the first things that drew me in. Sure, the campus has its own beauty in its architecture and nature, but it's the mountains that hold the power. The town itself is a mix of charming cafes and the bustle of a downtown area, like a small town that's also got the heart of a city. The change between the two is stark, like a call to explore and find your own rhythm. There are good memories here, like late-night walks with friends or movie nights, but also tough times, like those crying sessions in the middle of the night. Yet, even in those moments, the mountains are there, steady and solid, helping me find my way forward, one step at a time. When I look up at the sunrise, they're always there, painting the sky, a symbol of strength and resilience. They're the silent guardians, the constant reminder that I can press on, no matter what life throws at me.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, finding your way won't be an issue—public transportation is easily accessible and a go-to in NYC. Bensonhurt is packed with Asian stores, a result of the neighborhood's growing Asian population over the past two decades. Every block has at least one Asian-owned business, and supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular. Locals swear by the food quality and cheaper prices at these stores. In fact, four Asian supermarkets are within walking distance of where I live, making grocery shopping a breeze. But Bensonhurt isn't solely Asian—it's diverse with immigrants and their children too. Many local businesses, even popular ones, are Asian-owned, and a recently renovated park nearby offers basketball, soccer/football, and handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain. NYC parks are always diverse, and Bensonhurt is no exception.\n\nBensonhurt doesn't have many corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-ops, condos, and two-family houses. The neighborhood is generally friendly, though it can be noisy, especially with music blasting from passing cars and constant early morning driving. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with potential for trouble from bullies and thieves. I've had my share of experiences here, including physical assault and package theft. Dog waste is a constant issue, despite NYC's fine for not cleaning up. You'll see dog waste daily as you walk to the train or supermarket. My biggest gripe? Dog waste everywhere. Keep your shoes clean and be careful!",
            "I reside in a neighborhood where sidewalks are scarce, and the terrain drops rather sharply, with my house perched at the highest point. The locals dub it the \"work out hill\" due to its popularity among joggers. Given the lack of sidewalks, everyone traverses the street, which can be a bit treacherous due to potholes and the occasional hazardous wire. The weather here is rather damp and stormy, with the trees being a constant target for lightning and debris. The neighborhood is a forest of towering evergreens, but the locals seem to have a love-hate relationship with them. They prefer to hack them down to appreciate the ocean view, resulting in many houses built high up the hill with expansive glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets are stunning when the water catches the glow from below and the sky turns a fiery orange, though it's often cloudy, and the view is often marred by a haze. Moss thrives here, coating roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month and it returned as a green, furry beast, requiring hours to clean. Children are few and far between, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is filled with retirees, and dogs often take the place of children. They're common sights in lawns or dashing down the street, sometimes sneaking into open homes. Rabbits roam freely, causing chaos in gardens, but they're a favorite for the cats. Our skies are often filled with birds, from sparrows to eagles and hawks, though they're usually chased away by the neighborhood crows. The nearest amenities are at the waterfront, where a few restaurants serve fresh seafood. The beach isn't much, but the rocky shore is a delight for throwing stones into the water. The bay is narrow, and the opposite shore is visible even through the mist.",
            "We call home a typical southern suburb nestled between two state highways, which means we get a bit more traffic than we'd prefer. But outside of that, it's a quiet neighborhood that's grown familiar over time. Most folks stick to their daily routines—yard work, chores, the occasional walk or bike ride. In winter, we make the most of the hill on our side street for sledding. Our house sits at the corner of the street, offering a prime view of the comings and goings. We're a family of four—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. We work from home, so our presence is as constant as the lawnmowers that hum day in and day out from March to October.\n\nWe've got a thing for Fall here, with trees aplenty, leaves to rake, and the aroma of burning leaves that signals the season. It's become a long Fall this year, with little winter in sight. Our garage is at the back, so we hardly use the front door unless someone rings the bell. I spend my time there working on my truck or other projects, and with the garage doors open, it feels like I'm connected to the rhythm of the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet, but Thanksgiving and the like bring extra cars and visitors from out of town. All said, I'm fond of our little slice of suburbia. If we weren't on a through street, it'd be ideal.",
            "My 'hood's smack dab in the heart of the high desert, which means dirt, dirt, and more dirt. If you've not lived here, you can't really compreh endorsing the constant brown. The only green you see belongs to those who shell out big bucks on lawn care. When I first landed here in the 90s, homes were spread out, and that's still the case today, albeit with some new additions. It's like a city's creeping in, but I suppose the same transformation's happening everywhere. Locals are generally friendly, though, like any city, there's both good and bad. In my neck of the woods, I'm surrounded by pleasant old folks, making it a cozy neighborhood. The shops here are mostly chains - Food4Less, Smart & Final, that sort. You won't find Whole Foods or similar here. The prominent jobs in town are in construction, as this city's still pretty undeveloped and wide open spaces are abundant. That bothers me; I like things just the way they are now. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and my home's got a unique charm with the different critters. People come here for the stark desert beauty, and the high desert climate creates diverse ecosystems. It's crucial for human residents to understand and respect the non-human residents to co-exist peacefully. My kids are lizard and beetle enthusiasts, and we've adapted well to the wildlife. Attractions? There's Victorville for a desert experience, and the San Bernardino County Fair's a must-visit. Plus, the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood are a winter sports lover's dream. For history buffs, check out the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When quizzed about my 'hood, I'm certain my response is a bit peculiar. While others might be homeowners with their own lives, I'm a resident of a college campus, with my dorm as my community. The surrounding campus is my neighborhood, albeit less so. Yet, my 'hood shares similarities with conventional ones - it's got houses, people, shops, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\". There's apartments (2-4 per room, 4-6 rooms per floor, 20-ish people per building), regular houses for affiliated renters, and dorms housing hundreds. Next, the people: my school's diverse makeup echoes in my 'hood. Staff, freshmen, and upperclassmen live in houses, dorms, and apartments, respectively. Moving on, my 'hood has dining options, school-branded clothing and grocery stores, and a crime-free park where everyone plays.",
            "Well, after living here for nearly a decade, I suppose I can share a bit of what I’ve learned. I must admit, I was quite sad when I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a tough transition, but my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we made the move. Our new neighborhood was considered \"not ghetto\" with better housing and a better high school, but it took time to adjust. I made new friends, but also some enemies at school. I eventually got to know our neighbors Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They've been lovely company, almost like family. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding (he re-married) and having a blast. I caught his wife's bouquet, but unfortunately missed the flowers. We danced the night away, and I enjoyed hanging out with his daughter, Marsharii. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but a GPS makes exploration enjoyable. I've only ventured as far as the park where I enjoy nature, and practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken. I also have a basketball and tennis court nearby, though it's been a while since I last played. My dad and Mr. Graves taught me tennis, and we always had fun. There's plenty of stories and moments of joy in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My hood's in close proximity to my college, which is a major plus. It's mostly apartments, but there are a few eats and pours that hit the spot and don't hit the wallet too hard. Just got a new joint down the block—it's pricier now, but quality's not too shabby. Folks are cool, they're mostly students or strapped, as the digs aren't expensive. There's a school just around the corner, so it's chock-full of kids. I'm not really chummy with the neighbors, they're into the green stuff, and the management's gone and stuck an air freshener by their door, which is pretty funny. The buildings are vintage, but they've spruced up the insides. Just down the way, there's a new development, but it's cheaply done and the rent's pricey. The school of hard knocks is just around the corner, with a no-star restaurant serving microwaved grub and a gas station that's not so hot to work at. The city's spruced up the street last year, though, with a big sidewalk, green medians, and all. The tree canopy's thick where I live, with a few stumps here and there, but it's nicer than the street behind me. The 43rd is a mess, sidewalks are falling apart, and buildings look run-down. Crime's a thing over there, but it's not just them—the complex across from me's got its share too. The transit's convenient with two stops nearby, and the uni's within stroll. Plus, the rent's affordable, so I'm good.",
            "My hood's a grid of identical duplexes, each with a yellow facade, white porch, and green metal roof, spaced out like individual houses. Most everyone here is pals with their neighbors. We chill at the end of a makeshift driveway some evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's a refreshing throwback to simpler times, with fields and trees, blue skies, and white clouds—until the recent tornado warnings. Last night, an actual siren alerted us, and I found myself in the bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my big dog stayed in the living room, nervous. The hail was massive, and the temperature dropped from 92 to 75. After the storm, the road was steaming, and a double rainbow appeared. I snapped some pics for my Facebook fam. We're a tight-knit community, but we've all got different-sized apartments. I love walking the big field behind my place and listening to the bullfrog sing in the morning. It's a fantastic place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. Every morning is welcomed by rooster crows, and we've even got a donkey braying in the evening. I was fortunate to stumble upon this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I hit the ground running in this hood just as I hit the big leagues of eighth grade. Making pals wasn't easy at first, but I managed to connect with a buddy two doors down and another guy around my block. They're long gone now, but their presence is still etched in my mind. A lot of the folks who've been here since day one are still around. This neighborhood's got that classic American suburban vibe – two-story homes galore. On warmer days, the kids' laughter echoes through the streets. Most days are peaceful, and my neighbors have been nothing but cool. Once in a while, you'll hear about some unsavory incidents elsewhere, but here, we're all about keeping it real. My porch is a safe haven for packages too – never been snatched, touch wood. There's a park just a hop, skip, and a jump away. It's where I made some unforgettable memories playing ball with the locals. A few bruises and a busted nose came from it too, but the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I take the little ones from my cousin's for park visits. seeing them lose their minds on the swings triggers a wave of nostalgia. This neighborhood is a melting pot – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian eats, all within a mile. Food delivery's the new norm, but the classics like pizza and fast food are as ubiquitous as ever. The stores here are stocked with everything under the sun – dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store that's a Midwest staple. Even an Indian store popped up for a change of pace. All in all, I'm stoked to call this place home. Seeing the news and social media, you'd think the world's gone to the dogs, but my neighborhood's still got love to spare.",
            "My little town in South Carolina is nothing extraordinary, but it's got a big claim to fame in the agriculture world. It's the Peach Capital of the World, with farmland stretched out for miles, filled with peach orchards and cattle. The houses here are mostly two-story, with metal or gray shingle roofs, and they're spaced out, with plenty of room for animals and crops. The town center has a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the only shops. There's a small Chinese restaurant, a Mexican place, a burger joint, and a now-closed pizzeria. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a tiny family pharmacy known for its Cherry Coke, and there's an IGA grocery store for the basics, though many folks hit Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for more. Dollar General is the big attraction, packed from dawn till dusk. There's a long-standing furniture store run by a friendly lady, with movers to help deliver your purchase. Next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet grooming and boarding. Both the doctor's and vet's offices are a bit out of town but well-equipped. There's a single elementary school, and students head to the next town for middle and high school. The lack of parks is being addressed, with a new 2.5-acre recreational area in the works. As for entertainment, there's no movie theater or bowling alley, but it's a cozy town where you can pass right through without noticing.",
            "I first stumbled upon the story of my place while listening to a podcast about missing persons. Quite the shocker, considering every apartment in the neighborhood was listed for over a thousand bucks a month. None of my friends or I had even heard about it. Guess it's the struggle, right? A few of my pals even admitted to crying themselves to sleep at night. Expenses are through the roof, but we've gotten good at being frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the dusty aroma of flea market trinkets and vintage clothes. Smells a lot less in adulthood, unless you're into the \"grown-up\" scent. Maybe it's the smoke, maybe it's just the state of things. But the thrift stores always draw me in. The scent of dusty magazines on a closed piano wedges itself into the leather and sticks around, even after a good wash. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but it's a different story inside the stores—silent and serene. A great spot to kill an afternoon. With each passing year, the city's only getting more crowded. Cars and people are flooding the streets, and it's all part of its growing pains. I've been living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's the friendly neighbors that make it feel like I haven't totally botched my life. I've got a knack for cleaning up after myself and leaving food for my neighbors, and they do the same in return. We take care of each other—bringing each other mail, celebrating birthdays, and mourning funerals. The pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs ensure there's always some music in the air. It's a lively place to be. I'm lucky to have a community of friendly neighbors. We treat each other well and make sure to keep our shell, and the city rolls along like waves on the beach. I've got the dusty smell of adulthood, the silent thrift stores, and the friendly neighbors to keep me company in this sprawl.",
            "My locale is a classic cookie-cutter suburbia, with a strong homeowner's association presence. Upon entering, you'll see pristine single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's vigilant maintenance. The front yards are uniform, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, often featuring small trees. Every house has a two-car garage, and the streets are immaculately paved. There are no individual mailboxes; instead, everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox in a large grouping at the end of the street, with two larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is a blend of rural and suburban, with plenty of land for community pools and walking trails. Most residents are retired, with a sprinkling of middle-aged and young professionals. The city is surprisingly populous but has a small-town vibe. Amenities abound, including a mall that caters to organic food lovers and bargain hunters alike. It takes about 15 minutes to reach significant attractions, but once there, you'll find a wide range of stores. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained area with plenty of nice things like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to major shopping, it's easily accessible by car.",
            "I call the small Midwestern town where I dwell my home, but it's a place that's just outside the urban sprawl of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, nestled on the east side of town, is the most economically challenged area. It's a low-value neighborhood, with most homes rented or owned by those on limited incomes. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place to live. The neighbors are quite friendly, offering warm smiles and hellos as I stroll down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher, are still relatively low. We've had our share of violent incidents, like a few shootings and a homicide in the past decade within a few blocks. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family hasn't been directly impacted, aside from the occasional porch theft. Our town has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic, with many lives claimed by fentanyl overdoses. But we've got resources to combat this, including rehab centers and Narcan training for families and friends. Despite these challenges, there are plenty of positives. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with great staff who've ensured he hasn't faced any bullying. We have an active PTO planning annual events, and the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students. The town council has made improvements, but these are mainly in the city center and the west side, where most shopping and traffic are. The east side, where I live, often feels neglected. Yet, we love our home; it's comfortable and adequate. We've been here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural hub nestled on a hill, surrounded by historic structures. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and just a block away, there's this awesome arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Lines often form, especially on weekends in June and July. A few blocks up, we have our city park, quite large for the area. Concrete walls surround it, with tall steps leading up. During winter, homeless folks set up tents in rows along the sidewalk and steps, huddled together for warmth. Rain, not snow, is our harsh winter visitor, making it tough to stay warm. Their tents are close to the family center for miles around, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my neighborhood isn't the historic buildings or the architecture, but the spirit of its people. Once infamous for gang violence, the Hilltop still bears its past, and stories are passed down generation to generation. People work hard to maintain it, and they care deeply about their community. You're warned not to walk around after dark if you're white, a reminder of old days and social conditioning. I'm dark enough to get by, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, aware of the reminders of racism and fear. No matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who offer help without asking for something in return. It's a place where laundromat owners extend their hours to let me charge my phone when caught in the rain. It's a place where I've felt invisible, huddled against storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop and give me a $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I hail from the heart of rural America, smack dab in the middle of small-town Michigan. From here, you're a stone's throw from miles of farmland and quaint tourist destinations, but you won't find any big city amenities. No sprawling malls, no Wal-mart or Target, not even an Applebee’s nearby. To get anywhere, you've got to hop in the car. Despite the drive, I live in one of the most breathtaking spots on earth, surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every direction you turn, there's a beach waiting for your toes. My 'city' is a quintessential small town. Houses aren't stacked like towers, but rather spaced out. They're unique, not cookie-cutter, and often feature older aluminum siding. Some are updated, others are time-worn, but all have full basements visible from the road. Most homes have yards, with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for the occasional animal. The houses are a snapshot of Middle America - hardworking folks raising families or having raised them. Kids run up and down the streets, people walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors know each other, and you can spot the outsiders. You'll hear grilling outside and pleasant smiles from passersby. The lawns are well-maintained, with no leaves from last fall and green grass under control. This isn't a fancy neighborhood, but it's perfect for families. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While average-looking, it's exceptional for what it represents - a place where people can feel safe and secure. Just around the corner, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department, the city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, and a small airport. You can hear the hum of small planes taking off and landing while playing outside or inside. A leisurely bike ride or walk to the local ice cream shop is no problem, and even the park is just a short distance away. It's a fantastic place to call home, really."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a major city means my neighborhood is a melting pot of diverse communities. Residential areas are haphazardly interspersed with commercial sections, where a range of businesses operate, from offices to stores and entertainment spots. There's an abundance of new eateries and shops to explore, with both big-name corporations and quaint boutique stores lining the streets. Despite the hustle and bustle, a few parks are nearby where people stroll with their kids. Diversity is abundant, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish enclave, and former Soviet Union refugees and immigrants all within a small radius. Venturing beyond my immediate area reveals pockets of various ethnicities, such as Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia. But driving to these places can be a lengthy affair, even for a short 10-mile journey, thanks to the notorious traffic. Most people in the city prefer to drive, not walk, and parking is a challenge. Ironically, the city has seen a surge in construction, adding more apartment buildings. While it's attractive to new residents, many locals dread the increased population and traffic congestion. Housing options are varied, with single-family homes, duplexes, and apartments of different sizes. Even in my neighborhood, there's a mix of house types. People of all ages live here, and while it's not a tightly-knit community, I have fond childhood memories of playing with nearby neighbors.",
            "My hood's a unique blend of old and new, with single-family homes and a few split units. My crib's got a tiny front yard and a driveway to the left. Reminds me of that not-so-distant past when suburban living was the American dream, but it's losing its shine. My neighbors and I still hold onto the dream, but the optimism's dwindling. Kids play in the streets, footballs at the ready, with cars stopping traffic. The old public school's been here forever, inspiring today's youth while stirring nostalgic memories in the elders. Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always packed. Houses look different but feel the same. There's a Yemeni-owned supermarket, \"Super A,\" and most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids play football, pausing for passing cars. Lots of long-time residents, each with their own stories of the good ol' days. A former karate school turned into a pharmacy, because who needs martial arts when you can have pills? There's an old movie theatre that plays age-old flicks for cheap, attracting the elders but not the kids. We've got a nearby expressway, but we wanted an exit in our town. The youth wanted it, elders didn't. City council denied it, fearing it'd ruin the town. They're building a new high school, and we're deciding on a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect rep for our town.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance - it's behind a run-down shopping strip, not a place you'd guess there are places to live, and certainly not places most people would want to live. But if you walk past the old, abandoned Whole Foods and behind the hotels that only see life during summertime reunions, you'll find a hidden community. Nestled here are a few apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully taken apart and set in a row. The first ones you see have been in the news for some shady dealings, so let's skip them. But the ones beside and behind them are another world that hardly anyone in this area knows about. Across the road is a community college satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 AM. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, much to the annoyance of commuters who shake their fists out the window. The road branches into another residential street, with a park and a rehab center on one side. The center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids run around the park, doing cartwheels and pinwheels, while bees lazily buzz in the flower patches. Older folks walk their dogs, scowling at skateboarders and nodding at the teenage girls by the playground, gossiping about boys and YouTube trends. A strip mall beside the park has a sushi place with cheap food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat hibachi chicken all at once. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt place where teens clutch cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt while doing stunts on their skateboards and vaping. This neighborhood is a slice of old-school America - a piece of history in the slow-paced South where nothing much changes, not even time.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the endless sea of cornfields stretching towards the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing full well she’d be floored by the sheer openness of the landscape. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a mere five-minute walk from her doorstep—she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Blindsided by the omnipresence of cornfields, I filled her in on what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood both my identity and my roots. Cruising down a winding two-lane country road, you’ll eventually reach a sprawling quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the small development I call home. The houses here are predominantly brick and stucco, each with at least a half-acre of land—a pride of ownership that everyone takes to heart. During springtime, the driveways are lined with the highest-end Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, gleaming under the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we continued towards my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor, always with a cheerful smile, was out tending to his lawn. He spends the entire day mowing, his humming overpowering the mower’s noise. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a kick out of him, but he’s always genuine and has a fascinating past. He’s aged, losing some of his spark as the years went by. Underneath his cap, he was once a doctor and blends seamlessly with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you’ll reach my home. The side yard is teeming with geese, chased by our Terrier. Out back, there’s a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear the bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Crossing the handmade wooden bridge leads to an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood—building tree forts, ‘hunting’ animals (mostly chasing them), and always finding a playmate among the neighborhood kids. Winters in my small town can be harsh, but there’s nothing more breathtaking. The green yard transforms into a vast, empty wilderness. Trees, once adorned with vibrant colors, become bare skeletons. Occasionally, a snowfall blankets the landscape, transforming it into a winter wonderland overnight. The backyard is filled with snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister, and during our winter wars, snowballs were our ammunition. We’d build massive igloo-like forts stocked with branches like a weapons arsenal. In our own little winter wonderland, we played pretend, free from the world’s cares. We were just kids, with nothing but laughter and imagination.",
            "Portland, Oregon, is the epitome of \"weirdness\". Its unofficial motto, emblazoned on a building that's part pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club, reads \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nod to Portland's past, a time when it was less known and cheaper, fostering a culture of creativity and uniqueness. For others, it's a call to come to a place where being weird is, dare I say, trendy. Despite an influx of wealthy Californians and the ever-present construction of condos, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean open-armed acceptance, but it does mean embracing the unconventional. Portland, like any other city, imports most of its goods from China and has its share of modern amenities and conflicts. We have yoga, hipsters, and business professionals, but perhaps our weirdness stems from taking all this with a grain of salt. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, houses are vibrant, home gardens are lush, and sidewalks host free boxes. These are cardboard or plastic receptacles filled with treasures for the wandering passerby. Clothes, books—who knows what you'll find? Portland's magic lies in its neighborhoods. That's my take, but Portland is filled with oddities galore. Some might scoff at the idea of browsing discarded clothes for fashion or go to yoga with goats or support the local soccer team, the Timbers. Portland is a hub of passions and aspirations, with some folks spending too much time at the bar dreaming of chasing their dreams. Yes, addiction is an issue. It's often linked to mental health struggles, and the perpetual rain and gloomy skies don't help. Homelessness is another challenge. Portland's social services attract the homeless, but they're insufficient. The non-homeless population is split between concern and resentment. In this, Portland is oddly normal.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel in the north, testifying to the sun's daily dance of dawn and dusk. They're there, unwavering and unperturbed by life's ups and downs, even when I'm too busy to notice them. On those days when I'm at my most frazzled, they demand attention, and when I turn to them, they provide respite for my anxious soul, lending me the strength to trudge on, day by day. I first settled here for my undergrad, and the mountains north of campus were the first to captivate me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights, but it's the mountains that hold the crown. The rest of town is charming in its own right, with countless cafes that have been home to many caffeine-fueled study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where faded brick buildings and bustling restaurants give it a faded charm, echoing the vibrancy of its neighboring urban city. This mix of old and new, bustle and serenity, makes this town a fascinating place to explore and create cherished memories. Whether it's an all-nighter walk past the rusted swings in the park or a last-minute rush through downtown to catch a movie, the town offers a varied canvas for experiences. But it's also home to harsh memories, as all places are. The ponds, in particular, are a fitting place to reflect and even cry through existential crises, as I've done more times than I'd like to admit. Watching the pond's inhabitants go about their lives, I've often pondered my own sense of purpose. One day, as I walked past the pond and the park, towards the main street, the sun broke through the clouds, painting the sky with its rays and casting a golden glow over the palm trees. As I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north, and there they were, the mountains that have always been there. They loomed large against the sky, stirring in me a renewed sense of perseverance.",
            "If you're planning to head to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you've got it made when it comes to getting there—public transportation is a cinch, and it's one of the most popular modes of transit in NYC. Bensonhurst is pretty urban, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Asian stores are dotted throughout the neighborhood, with an influx of Asian inhabitants over the past two decades. You'll find an Asian-owned store on nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being the most prevalent. Locals swear by the quality of food and the reasonable prices at these businesses—they're a godsend. Just around the corner from me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other. But don't think Bensonhurst is all Asian—it's diverse, with immigrants and their offspring living side by side. The majority of big businesses are Asian-owned, and there's even a recently renovated park nearby with ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain. Since it's New York, you know the parks will be diverse and welcoming to everyone. You won't find many corporate buildings here; most are co-op or condo apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and while the neighborhood is generally nice, it can be quite loud—cars blasting music and drivers flooring it can wake you up in the morning. Nighttime visitors should be cautious; while it's generally safe, folks can be unpredictable, and there are occasional incidents of trouble-making, bullying, and theft. I've personally been on the receiving end of physical assault and package theft in the past, although that was a while ago. Dog owners also tend to ignore the rule about cleaning up after their pets; you'll find dog waste on the streets every morning. My biggest peeve is walking through dog waste, so I keep my shoes clean!",
            "My locale lacks sidewalks, and my dwelling sits atop the steepest incline, dubbed \"work out hill\" by nearby joggers. The main thoroughfare is pitted and weathered, with dangling wires and frequent repairs. Our region is damp, with constant rain and storms bringing down branches and power lines, leaving them in a patchwork state. Towering evergreens surround us, much to the displeasure of residents who see them as obstructions to ocean views. Houses are built high with large glass facades to catch the view, particularly at sunset when the water glows and the sky turns orange. But it's often overcast, with a haze obscuring the sun. Moss thrives on rooftops, cars, and railings, and even my car turned green from a month's neglect. Kids are scarce, replaced by dogs that roam, and rabbits that dig up lawns. My cats have taken care of most of the rabbit problem. Birdlife includes sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasional hawks chased by crows. Though there are no shops, a few restaurants serve fresh seafood by the waterfront, where rocks make for decent skipping. The bay is narrow, often visible despite the mist.",
            "I call my humble abode home in a picturesque southern Tennessee suburb. It's nestled at the intersection of two state highways, which means we get more than our fair share of traffic, but other than that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. The folks who live here are an eclectic bunch, and I've grown accustomed to most of them. Yard work and daily chores keep everyone busy, and in the winter, we can be found sledding down the hill on our side street. We're the lucky residents who live at the front corner, so we're always up to speed with the comings and goings of the neighborhood. Whenever we spot a strange vehicle, our antennae go up. Some folks take to the streets for exercise or to walk their dogs, while kids zoom around on their bikes. We're a family of four—myself, my lovely wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen—and we're a regular fixture on the street. We make the most of our outdoor time, sometimes even braving the rain. BBQing on our back deck brings a delightful aroma to the air, and the sound of lawn mowers is a summertime staple. Our neighborhood is a veritable forest, with a plethora of trees and an abundance of leaves in the fall. Leaf-raking and leaf-burning become annual rituals, and the scent is a comforting herald of autumn's arrival. The winters here are mild, making it feel like a long fall. Our garage sits at the back, so we barely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is a rare occurrence. I spend my time working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are usually quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving and other visiting times when extra cars line the streets. All things considered, I'm content living here. If it weren't for the constant traffic, it would be idyllic.",
            "My neighborhood is slap bang in the middle of the high desert, where there's dirt, dirt, and more dirt. If you haven't lived here, you can't truly understand the constant brown, and when you do see a lawn, it's clear that person's dropping serious cash on upkeep. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide out here, but now it's pretty much the same, with plenty of new additions. The place looks more and more like a city every day, but hey, that's the way things are going, right? Most of the neighbors are super friendly, but like any city, there are good parts and bad. In my hood, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so I guess it's a pretty nice neighborhood. The shops around here are mostly chain places like Food For Less and Smart and Final. If you want organic, you'll have to venture out. The most common jobs around here are construction, which makes sense since this city is still largely undeveloped. That's a bit scary for me; I left a big city and don't fancy going back. My full-time gig is as a drywall and T-bar installer, which is where I'm based. What I love about my home are the various critters. People come to the high desert for the stark beauty of the place. The desert's climate and terrain have created unique ecosystems that need protection and are home to all sorts of wildlife. To coexist safely, we humans should get to know our non-human neighbors. My kids and I have adapted well to the wildlife. Right now, my three kids are outside trying to catch lizards and desert bugs while I write. As for attractions, Victorville is a great spot for families to experience the desert. If you can, time your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. It's a great mix of activities and fun. Plus, take a trip to nearby Wrightwood to see snow-capped mountains and enjoy some winter sports. If you're into natural history and culture, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's packed with geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When someone asks about my 'hood, it's not like theirs, that's for sure. I mean, I ain't got no place to call my own like most folks do. My neighborhood's the campus I live on, and the folks in my dorm are my crew. The campus itself is my neighborhood too, but not as much. Still, it's got all the essentials - homes, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the homes first. There's apartments, actual houses, and dorms. Apartments usually house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and most buildings have 2 floors, housing about 20 or so people. Houses are for alumni, but there's not many around. Then there's the dorms, where you'll find 100's of students living in rooms that house two people, with some exceptions. Most newer students and staff live in these, while older students and staff live in apartments.\n\nMoving on to the people, diversity is my neighborhood's trademark. It's a mix of all ages and cultures, with staff in houses and newer students in dorms. The stores? You'll find all sorts of dining options, plus our school's unique clothing and grocery shops. And the park? It's a playground for all, kept clean and safe by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Well, considering I've been here for a decade, I guess I can share what I've experienced. First off, I was pretty bummed when I first moved to this neighborhood. Coming from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a change, and I'm not gonna lie, I missed home and cried. But my folks had their reasons, and we moved for better housing, a better high school, and to leave behind the 'ghetto'. Over the years, I adapted, made new friends, and even enemies in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis for a bit, who lived right next door. They've been great, almost like family. I remember attending Mr. Glen's remarriage, it was a blast. Ms. Veda's little white leg-strap was a horrific entrance, but I caught it! Sadly, I missed the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I enjoyed hanging with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Hope she's doing well now. The neighborhood's a maze, but with GPS, I can explore it now. I've only gone so far, and that's where I hang with Kason and Curtis. We'd play games and live life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd go to the park, enjoy nature, and practice balance with home depot sticks and my bokken. There's a basketball and tennis court too, though I haven't played in ages. My pops raised me and my bestie on tennis with Mr. Graves, and we'd have a blast. There's been plenty of fun times, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My pad is in the vicinity of the uni I attend, which is pretty swell as you can imagine. The housing mostly consists of apartment blocks, but there are a handful of eateries and taverns that are a blast to frequent and aren't breaking the bank. One joint just got a new name, and it's a bit pricier now, but the service and drinks are solid. The locals are a friendly bunch, mainly comprised of students and those with a lower income since the rent is fair. There's an elementary school a stone's throw away, so there are plenty of tykes around. I'm not really close with my neighbors, and that's just fine by me, as they're quite the pot heads. The building management found that out and placed an air freshener unit across from their door, which my partner and I thought was a hoot. The edifices in the area are mostly old but have had some sprucing up inside. Further down the road, there are some newbuilds, but I'm not a fan as I suspect the construction wasn't up to par. They're cheaply made but the rent is steep, which I think is a rip-off but they get away with it due to the campus proximity. There's a budget joint a few minutes' walk, serving up food on paper plates, most microwaved. Across the street is a gas station, not the best place to work, but the city gave it a makeover last summer with a broad sidewalk, lush greenery, and a tidier look. Our apartment block is wrapped in trees, though a few were chopped down, leaving behind a few stumps. Behind us is a tree line and another set of apartments. We're on 42nd Street, but 43rd just behind us isn't as pleasant. The sidewalks are in shambles and the buildings look rough. The trees are probably there to disguise the buildings' state. Crime has been an issue in the area, especially at an apartment complex on that street, but it's not just them. There are places across the street with similar issues. But I dig where I live—I can afford it and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. Plus, the uni is within walking distance and there are two bus stops for easy access to the shops and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a cul-de-sac lined with yellow duplexes, spaced out to look like individual houses with white porches and green metal roofs. Most neighbors are pals, and we often gather at the end of the driveway for a chat while the kids play. It's a throwback to simpler times in this tech-filled world. Surrounded by fields and trees with a blue sky and fluffy clouds, it's a peaceful haven. Tornado warnings have been popping up this season, and last night wasn't an exception. I found myself huddled in my bathtub with my purse and pillows, my little dog in my arms, while my bigger one barked nervously in the living room. The storm brought hail, and the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. After the storm, a double rainbow appeared, which I quickly snapped photos of to share. The neighborhood was quiet afterwards, but eventually, everyone returned from their hiding spots. Dinner was cooking as mothers and kids ventured outside. This place is a charming Southern gem for me, a transplant from NH to NC. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, and although the houses look alike, the interiors vary. I love strolling across the large field to the pond (not for swimming) where I've seen deer and heard the bullfrog sing in the morning. It's forty minutes from Charlotte, and I'm lucky to call this small community village my home. The surrounding farms have a rooster crowing each morning, and sometimes, I hear a donkey braying in the evening.",
            "So, I rolled into this hood just before eighth grade kicked off. It was a rough go at making buddies at first, but I eventually hit it off with a couple of dudes – one lived two doors down, the other on my street. Both moved on, but the memories remain. The originals are still here, for the most part. My 'hood's pretty typical American suburban fare: two-story houses galore, kids playing every warm weekend, weekday silence. No issues with neighbors, no package snatching, and a park 'bout a minute away. Basketball, football, and baseball memories (including a nasty elbow to the nose) are etched in there. Now, it's my cousin’s kids who make the park their playground, filling it with giggles and excitement. The park is pure nostalgia now. This hood's diverse, food-wise – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – all within a mile or so. GrubHub and DoorDash are the norm these days, but there's a heap of pizza joints too. Stores have everything you need, from dry cleaners to CVS and Walgreens, and even an Indian store for those midwestern tastes. I'm a fan of my 'hood, and reading about other folks' horror stories makes me damned grateful for mine.",
            "My town, Johnston, is a sleepy little number nestled in South Carolina. It's not the flashiest or most unique place, but it stands tall in the agribusiness world as the Peach Capital of the World. The sign at the entrance makes that clear, and the farmland stretching out in every direction is a testament to that. Houses here are scattered, often standing two stories high with either metal or gray shingle roofs to keep cool in the summer. The main drag is home to the town's essentials: a one-stop light, three little eateries (Chinese, Mexican, and a burger joint), a pharmacy that's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola, an expensive grocery store, a Dollar General that's always bustling, a furniture store with delivery service, a pet groomer, and a pair of clinics for human and animal health. The town doesn't boast much in terms of entertainment, with no parks, theaters, or bowling alleys. But Johnston Elementary School is a highlight, and the town is working on adding a recreational area to keep families and potential residents happy. It's a simple place, but that's part of its charm. You could easily miss it if you blink!",
            "My first introduction to this city was through a podcast about vanished locals. The price tags for apartments were sky-high, way over a grand a month. None of my friends or I had heard about this before. I guess it's the struggle that keeps us going. Most nights, my buddies and I just end up bawling our eyes out. But we've had to adapt to the cost of living, learning to love the faint scent of dusty thrift store finds. It's the smell of adulthood, the one that lingers even after you've washed it off your clothes. Around here, there's a trio of thrift shops within walking distance. If you start on the far end, you can hit up two charity stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curiosity shop. Downtown's bustling, with cars and folks flooding the streets every morning, but inside the thrifts, it's always dead silent. It's a perfect spot to lose hours. This city's on the rise, they say. It's the headquarters for one of the world's biggest e-commerce giants, still feeling its growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone here has their own game plan, and no one particularly cares what you're up to. You can retreat into your shell, and the city will just keep on rolling like the tide. It's a lively place to be. Neighbors play music next door and sing upstairs, there's always some sort of event. It's a community of friends, not just a bunch of strangers. We come together for essentials, birthdays, funerals, and mutual aid. I'm grateful to be here. Most of my neighbors are cool, and they're kind too. I leave food, bring mail, and they do the same. It's a nice routine. Despite living in a vast, faceless modernist sprawl, it's the people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't lost my mind.",
            "The hood I'm from is your classic cookie-cutter 'burb. The neighborhood association here is nuts about uniformity. First thing you'll notice is the uniformity of the homes - all single-family, well-maintained, and with two-car garages. Front yards are all identical with a patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Trees are here and there too. The streets are immaculate with no potholes to be seen. Most of the homes are single-story, but you'll occasionally spot a two-story joint. No individual mailboxes here; it's more like an apartment complex. Everyone uses a key to access their mailbox, and there are big lockers for packages. I'm at the edge of the city, so it's half rural, half 'burb. Lots of land means multiple community pools and walking trails. The neighborhood is mostly made up of retired folks, but there's a mix of middle-age and young professionals too. The city is big by population but has a small-town feel. We've got all the amenities you'd expect - like a mall, high-end groceries, and bargain outlets. It takes about 15 minutes to get anywhere significant, and then there's plenty to choose from. It's safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We've got pools, walking trails, and while we're not super close to shopping, a car ride away gets you to any major chain you'd like.",
            "I'm based in a small Midwestern town that's nestled just outside the sprawling suburbs of a big city. The east side of my neighborhood, where I reside, is the most economically challenged area. Most houses here are rented or owned by low-income folks, but it's not all that unpleasant. My neighbors here are generally friendly, giving a nod and a smile when I'm out. Crime rates are a bit higher in comparison to other parts of town, with a few violent incidents in recent years, including a shooting outside an area bar that took the life of our next-door neighbor's son. Fortunately, my family has escaped these incidents unscathed, apart from some minor thefts from our porch. Our town has been heavily impacted by the opioid epidemic, which has claimed many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. However, we have several addiction centers and Narcan training sessions to help combat this issue. Despite these challenges, there are plenty of positives. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with a supportive staff who have made his special needs journey smooth and bully-free. The PTO there has organized numerous family events, and the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students. The City Council has made improvements, but they've mainly been on the west side where the shopping areas are. While this has left my east side feeling slightly neglected, the overall quality of life is good. I've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine myself anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a treasure trove of culture. Perched on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings that carry historical weight, and I live in a 7-story apartment block directly across from an old live theater. Just a block down the Hill is a quaint arcade bar that attracts various types of folks on warm summer nights. Lines of people often form outside this spot, especially during weekends in June and July. A few blocks up is a substantial city park. Though it's centrally located, it's surprisingly big for the area it inhabits. The park is ringed by concrete steps, and during winter, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, as rain is more common than snow in these parts. They huddle close together for warmth and are conveniently within reach of the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I adore about my city is the people themselves. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and tales of the government's attempts to clean the streets are still told today. These stories echo through the generations, even among transplants like me. The residents work hard to keep their 'hood clean and are vigilant about what happens in their city. They say, \"If you're white, don't walk the Hill at night.\" This caution may stem from the past, and it's tinged with social conditioning. Perhaps it's my dark enough skin that I pass as not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone deeply aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions that haunt our nation. I know one thing—no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, greeted by people who've offered me jackets rather than trouble. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open late for me to charge my phone, and where I've waited, feeling invisible, against concrete storefronts on the bleakest nights, only to receive a $5 from a stranger who told me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call Rural America my home, specifically in small town Michigan. The drive from farmland to tourist cities is a common sight. Forget about big city malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or Applebee’s, here you drive if you need to go anywhere. But let me tell you, I live in one of the most breathtaking places on Earth, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are my neighbors, and you can find a beach to dip your toes in everywhere you go. My neighborhood embodies the heart of small town living. Houses aren’t stacked, cookie-cutter, or new. They’re older, some updated, others with aluminum siding. Full basements line the streets, and yards boast trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for animals. Middle America's spirit is alive here, with hardworking folks raising families. Kids play freely in the streets, and neighbors know their neighbors. Lawns are well-maintained, with no leaves piled up from fall. It's a peaceful, safe haven, and while it's not flashy, it's exceptional in representing what people yearn for. The county sheriff's department and jail are nearby, as is the health department and recycling center. Baseball and softball fields are close by, with the small town airport nearby. You can hear small engine planes buzzing overhead. Ice cream from the local shop is a walk away, and downtown is just a bike ride or walk from our neighborhood. My kids ride their bikes to the park just a few blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a major city means my neighborhood is a melting pot of diverse communities. Residential areas are haphazardly interspersed with commercial sections, where a range of businesses operate, from offices to stores and entertainment spots. There's an abundance of new eateries and shops to explore, with both big-name corporations and quaint boutique stores lining the streets. Despite the hustle and bustle, a few parks are nearby where people stroll with their kids. Diversity is abundant, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish enclave, and former Soviet Union refugees and immigrants all within a small radius. Venturing beyond my immediate area reveals pockets of various ethnicities, such as Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia. But driving to these places can be a lengthy affair, even for a short 10-mile journey, thanks to the notorious traffic. Most people in the city prefer to drive, not walk, and parking is a challenge. Ironically, the city has seen a surge in construction, adding more apartment buildings. While it's attractive to new residents, many locals dread the increased population and traffic congestion. Housing options are varied, with single-family homes, duplexes, and apartments of different sizes. Even in my neighborhood, there's a mix of house types. People of all ages live here, and while it's not a tightly-knit community, I have fond childhood memories of playing with nearby neighbors.",
            "My hood's a unique blend of old and new, with single-family homes and a few split units. My crib's got a tiny front yard and a driveway to the left. Reminds me of that not-so-distant past when suburban living was the American dream, but it's losing its shine. My neighbors and I still hold onto the dream, but the optimism's dwindling. Kids play in the streets, footballs at the ready, with cars stopping traffic. The old public school's been here forever, inspiring today's youth while stirring nostalgic memories in the elders. Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always packed. Houses look different but feel the same. There's a Yemeni-owned supermarket, \"Super A,\" and most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids play football, pausing for passing cars. Lots of long-time residents, each with their own stories of the good ol' days. A former karate school turned into a pharmacy, because who needs martial arts when you can have pills? There's an old movie theatre that plays age-old flicks for cheap, attracting the elders but not the kids. We've got a nearby expressway, but we wanted an exit in our town. The youth wanted it, elders didn't. City council denied it, fearing it'd ruin the town. They're building a new high school, and we're deciding on a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect rep for our town.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance - it's behind a run-down shopping strip, not a place you'd guess there are places to live, and certainly not places most people would want to live. But if you walk past the old, abandoned Whole Foods and behind the hotels that only see life during summertime reunions, you'll find a hidden community. Nestled here are a few apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully taken apart and set in a row. The first ones you see have been in the news for some shady dealings, so let's skip them. But the ones beside and behind them are another world that hardly anyone in this area knows about. Across the road is a community college satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 AM. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, much to the annoyance of commuters who shake their fists out the window. The road branches into another residential street, with a park and a rehab center on one side. The center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids run around the park, doing cartwheels and pinwheels, while bees lazily buzz in the flower patches. Older folks walk their dogs, scowling at skateboarders and nodding at the teenage girls by the playground, gossiping about boys and YouTube trends. A strip mall beside the park has a sushi place with cheap food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat hibachi chicken all at once. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt place where teens clutch cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt while doing stunts on their skateboards and vaping. This neighborhood is a slice of old-school America - a piece of history in the slow-paced South where nothing much changes, not even time.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the endless sea of cornfields stretching towards the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing full well she’d be floored by the sheer openness of the landscape. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a mere five-minute walk from her doorstep—she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Blindsided by the omnipresence of cornfields, I filled her in on what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood both my identity and my roots. Cruising down a winding two-lane country road, you’ll eventually reach a sprawling quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the small development I call home. The houses here are predominantly brick and stucco, each with at least a half-acre of land—a pride of ownership that everyone takes to heart. During springtime, the driveways are lined with the highest-end Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, gleaming under the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we continued towards my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor, always with a cheerful smile, was out tending to his lawn. He spends the entire day mowing, his humming overpowering the mower’s noise. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a kick out of him, but he’s always genuine and has a fascinating past. He’s aged, losing some of his spark as the years went by. Underneath his cap, he was once a doctor and blends seamlessly with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you’ll reach my home. The side yard is teeming with geese, chased by our Terrier. Out back, there’s a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear the bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Crossing the handmade wooden bridge leads to an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood—building tree forts, ‘hunting’ animals (mostly chasing them), and always finding a playmate among the neighborhood kids. Winters in my small town can be harsh, but there’s nothing more breathtaking. The green yard transforms into a vast, empty wilderness. Trees, once adorned with vibrant colors, become bare skeletons. Occasionally, a snowfall blankets the landscape, transforming it into a winter wonderland overnight. The backyard is filled with snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister, and during our winter wars, snowballs were our ammunition. We’d build massive igloo-like forts stocked with branches like a weapons arsenal. In our own little winter wonderland, we played pretend, free from the world’s cares. We were just kids, with nothing but laughter and imagination.",
            "Portland, Oregon, is the epitome of \"weirdness\". Its unofficial motto, emblazoned on a building that's part pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club, reads \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nod to Portland's past, a time when it was less known and cheaper, fostering a culture of creativity and uniqueness. For others, it's a call to come to a place where being weird is, dare I say, trendy. Despite an influx of wealthy Californians and the ever-present construction of condos, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean open-armed acceptance, but it does mean embracing the unconventional. Portland, like any other city, imports most of its goods from China and has its share of modern amenities and conflicts. We have yoga, hipsters, and business professionals, but perhaps our weirdness stems from taking all this with a grain of salt. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, houses are vibrant, home gardens are lush, and sidewalks host free boxes. These are cardboard or plastic receptacles filled with treasures for the wandering passerby. Clothes, books—who knows what you'll find? Portland's magic lies in its neighborhoods. That's my take, but Portland is filled with oddities galore. Some might scoff at the idea of browsing discarded clothes for fashion or go to yoga with goats or support the local soccer team, the Timbers. Portland is a hub of passions and aspirations, with some folks spending too much time at the bar dreaming of chasing their dreams. Yes, addiction is an issue. It's often linked to mental health struggles, and the perpetual rain and gloomy skies don't help. Homelessness is another challenge. Portland's social services attract the homeless, but they're insufficient. The non-homeless population is split between concern and resentment. In this, Portland is oddly normal.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel in the north, testifying to the sun's daily dance of dawn and dusk. They're there, unwavering and unperturbed by life's ups and downs, even when I'm too busy to notice them. On those days when I'm at my most frazzled, they demand attention, and when I turn to them, they provide respite for my anxious soul, lending me the strength to trudge on, day by day. I first settled here for my undergrad, and the mountains north of campus were the first to captivate me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights, but it's the mountains that hold the crown. The rest of town is charming in its own right, with countless cafes that have been home to many caffeine-fueled study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where faded brick buildings and bustling restaurants give it a faded charm, echoing the vibrancy of its neighboring urban city. This mix of old and new, bustle and serenity, makes this town a fascinating place to explore and create cherished memories. Whether it's an all-nighter walk past the rusted swings in the park or a last-minute rush through downtown to catch a movie, the town offers a varied canvas for experiences. But it's also home to harsh memories, as all places are. The ponds, in particular, are a fitting place to reflect and even cry through existential crises, as I've done more times than I'd like to admit. Watching the pond's inhabitants go about their lives, I've often pondered my own sense of purpose. One day, as I walked past the pond and the park, towards the main street, the sun broke through the clouds, painting the sky with its rays and casting a golden glow over the palm trees. As I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north, and there they were, the mountains that have always been there. They loomed large against the sky, stirring in me a renewed sense of perseverance.",
            "If you're planning to head to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you've got it made when it comes to getting there—public transportation is a cinch, and it's one of the most popular modes of transit in NYC. Bensonhurst is pretty urban, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Asian stores are dotted throughout the neighborhood, with an influx of Asian inhabitants over the past two decades. You'll find an Asian-owned store on nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being the most prevalent. Locals swear by the quality of food and the reasonable prices at these businesses—they're a godsend. Just around the corner from me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other. But don't think Bensonhurst is all Asian—it's diverse, with immigrants and their offspring living side by side. The majority of big businesses are Asian-owned, and there's even a recently renovated park nearby with ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain. Since it's New York, you know the parks will be diverse and welcoming to everyone. You won't find many corporate buildings here; most are co-op or condo apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and while the neighborhood is generally nice, it can be quite loud—cars blasting music and drivers flooring it can wake you up in the morning. Nighttime visitors should be cautious; while it's generally safe, folks can be unpredictable, and there are occasional incidents of trouble-making, bullying, and theft. I've personally been on the receiving end of physical assault and package theft in the past, although that was a while ago. Dog owners also tend to ignore the rule about cleaning up after their pets; you'll find dog waste on the streets every morning. My biggest peeve is walking through dog waste, so I keep my shoes clean!",
            "My locale lacks sidewalks, and my dwelling sits atop the steepest incline, dubbed \"work out hill\" by nearby joggers. The main thoroughfare is pitted and weathered, with dangling wires and frequent repairs. Our region is damp, with constant rain and storms bringing down branches and power lines, leaving them in a patchwork state. Towering evergreens surround us, much to the displeasure of residents who see them as obstructions to ocean views. Houses are built high with large glass facades to catch the view, particularly at sunset when the water glows and the sky turns orange. But it's often overcast, with a haze obscuring the sun. Moss thrives on rooftops, cars, and railings, and even my car turned green from a month's neglect. Kids are scarce, replaced by dogs that roam, and rabbits that dig up lawns. My cats have taken care of most of the rabbit problem. Birdlife includes sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasional hawks chased by crows. Though there are no shops, a few restaurants serve fresh seafood by the waterfront, where rocks make for decent skipping. The bay is narrow, often visible despite the mist.",
            "I call my humble abode home in a picturesque southern Tennessee suburb. It's nestled at the intersection of two state highways, which means we get more than our fair share of traffic, but other than that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. The folks who live here are an eclectic bunch, and I've grown accustomed to most of them. Yard work and daily chores keep everyone busy, and in the winter, we can be found sledding down the hill on our side street. We're the lucky residents who live at the front corner, so we're always up to speed with the comings and goings of the neighborhood. Whenever we spot a strange vehicle, our antennae go up. Some folks take to the streets for exercise or to walk their dogs, while kids zoom around on their bikes. We're a family of four—myself, my lovely wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen—and we're a regular fixture on the street. We make the most of our outdoor time, sometimes even braving the rain. BBQing on our back deck brings a delightful aroma to the air, and the sound of lawn mowers is a summertime staple. Our neighborhood is a veritable forest, with a plethora of trees and an abundance of leaves in the fall. Leaf-raking and leaf-burning become annual rituals, and the scent is a comforting herald of autumn's arrival. The winters here are mild, making it feel like a long fall. Our garage sits at the back, so we barely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is a rare occurrence. I spend my time working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are usually quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving and other visiting times when extra cars line the streets. All things considered, I'm content living here. If it weren't for the constant traffic, it would be idyllic.",
            "My neighborhood is slap bang in the middle of the high desert, where there's dirt, dirt, and more dirt. If you haven't lived here, you can't truly understand the constant brown, and when you do see a lawn, it's clear that person's dropping serious cash on upkeep. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide out here, but now it's pretty much the same, with plenty of new additions. The place looks more and more like a city every day, but hey, that's the way things are going, right? Most of the neighbors are super friendly, but like any city, there are good parts and bad. In my hood, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so I guess it's a pretty nice neighborhood. The shops around here are mostly chain places like Food For Less and Smart and Final. If you want organic, you'll have to venture out. The most common jobs around here are construction, which makes sense since this city is still largely undeveloped. That's a bit scary for me; I left a big city and don't fancy going back. My full-time gig is as a drywall and T-bar installer, which is where I'm based. What I love about my home are the various critters. People come to the high desert for the stark beauty of the place. The desert's climate and terrain have created unique ecosystems that need protection and are home to all sorts of wildlife. To coexist safely, we humans should get to know our non-human neighbors. My kids and I have adapted well to the wildlife. Right now, my three kids are outside trying to catch lizards and desert bugs while I write. As for attractions, Victorville is a great spot for families to experience the desert. If you can, time your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. It's a great mix of activities and fun. Plus, take a trip to nearby Wrightwood to see snow-capped mountains and enjoy some winter sports. If you're into natural history and culture, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's packed with geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When someone asks about my 'hood, it's not like theirs, that's for sure. I mean, I ain't got no place to call my own like most folks do. My neighborhood's the campus I live on, and the folks in my dorm are my crew. The campus itself is my neighborhood too, but not as much. Still, it's got all the essentials - homes, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the homes first. There's apartments, actual houses, and dorms. Apartments usually house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and most buildings have 2 floors, housing about 20 or so people. Houses are for alumni, but there's not many around. Then there's the dorms, where you'll find 100's of students living in rooms that house two people, with some exceptions. Most newer students and staff live in these, while older students and staff live in apartments.\n\nMoving on to the people, diversity is my neighborhood's trademark. It's a mix of all ages and cultures, with staff in houses and newer students in dorms. The stores? You'll find all sorts of dining options, plus our school's unique clothing and grocery shops. And the park? It's a playground for all, kept clean and safe by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Well, considering I've been here for a decade, I guess I can share what I've experienced. First off, I was pretty bummed when I first moved to this neighborhood. Coming from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a change, and I'm not gonna lie, I missed home and cried. But my folks had their reasons, and we moved for better housing, a better high school, and to leave behind the 'ghetto'. Over the years, I adapted, made new friends, and even enemies in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis for a bit, who lived right next door. They've been great, almost like family. I remember attending Mr. Glen's remarriage, it was a blast. Ms. Veda's little white leg-strap was a horrific entrance, but I caught it! Sadly, I missed the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I enjoyed hanging with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Hope she's doing well now. The neighborhood's a maze, but with GPS, I can explore it now. I've only gone so far, and that's where I hang with Kason and Curtis. We'd play games and live life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd go to the park, enjoy nature, and practice balance with home depot sticks and my bokken. There's a basketball and tennis court too, though I haven't played in ages. My pops raised me and my bestie on tennis with Mr. Graves, and we'd have a blast. There's been plenty of fun times, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My pad is in the vicinity of the uni I attend, which is pretty swell as you can imagine. The housing mostly consists of apartment blocks, but there are a handful of eateries and taverns that are a blast to frequent and aren't breaking the bank. One joint just got a new name, and it's a bit pricier now, but the service and drinks are solid. The locals are a friendly bunch, mainly comprised of students and those with a lower income since the rent is fair. There's an elementary school a stone's throw away, so there are plenty of tykes around. I'm not really close with my neighbors, and that's just fine by me, as they're quite the pot heads. The building management found that out and placed an air freshener unit across from their door, which my partner and I thought was a hoot. The edifices in the area are mostly old but have had some sprucing up inside. Further down the road, there are some newbuilds, but I'm not a fan as I suspect the construction wasn't up to par. They're cheaply made but the rent is steep, which I think is a rip-off but they get away with it due to the campus proximity. There's a budget joint a few minutes' walk, serving up food on paper plates, most microwaved. Across the street is a gas station, not the best place to work, but the city gave it a makeover last summer with a broad sidewalk, lush greenery, and a tidier look. Our apartment block is wrapped in trees, though a few were chopped down, leaving behind a few stumps. Behind us is a tree line and another set of apartments. We're on 42nd Street, but 43rd just behind us isn't as pleasant. The sidewalks are in shambles and the buildings look rough. The trees are probably there to disguise the buildings' state. Crime has been an issue in the area, especially at an apartment complex on that street, but it's not just them. There are places across the street with similar issues. But I dig where I live—I can afford it and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. Plus, the uni is within walking distance and there are two bus stops for easy access to the shops and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a cul-de-sac lined with yellow duplexes, spaced out to look like individual houses with white porches and green metal roofs. Most neighbors are pals, and we often gather at the end of the driveway for a chat while the kids play. It's a throwback to simpler times in this tech-filled world. Surrounded by fields and trees with a blue sky and fluffy clouds, it's a peaceful haven. Tornado warnings have been popping up this season, and last night wasn't an exception. I found myself huddled in my bathtub with my purse and pillows, my little dog in my arms, while my bigger one barked nervously in the living room. The storm brought hail, and the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. After the storm, a double rainbow appeared, which I quickly snapped photos of to share. The neighborhood was quiet afterwards, but eventually, everyone returned from their hiding spots. Dinner was cooking as mothers and kids ventured outside. This place is a charming Southern gem for me, a transplant from NH to NC. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, and although the houses look alike, the interiors vary. I love strolling across the large field to the pond (not for swimming) where I've seen deer and heard the bullfrog sing in the morning. It's forty minutes from Charlotte, and I'm lucky to call this small community village my home. The surrounding farms have a rooster crowing each morning, and sometimes, I hear a donkey braying in the evening.",
            "So, I rolled into this hood just before eighth grade kicked off. It was a rough go at making buddies at first, but I eventually hit it off with a couple of dudes – one lived two doors down, the other on my street. Both moved on, but the memories remain. The originals are still here, for the most part. My 'hood's pretty typical American suburban fare: two-story houses galore, kids playing every warm weekend, weekday silence. No issues with neighbors, no package snatching, and a park 'bout a minute away. Basketball, football, and baseball memories (including a nasty elbow to the nose) are etched in there. Now, it's my cousin’s kids who make the park their playground, filling it with giggles and excitement. The park is pure nostalgia now. This hood's diverse, food-wise – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – all within a mile or so. GrubHub and DoorDash are the norm these days, but there's a heap of pizza joints too. Stores have everything you need, from dry cleaners to CVS and Walgreens, and even an Indian store for those midwestern tastes. I'm a fan of my 'hood, and reading about other folks' horror stories makes me damned grateful for mine.",
            "My town, Johnston, is a sleepy little number nestled in South Carolina. It's not the flashiest or most unique place, but it stands tall in the agribusiness world as the Peach Capital of the World. The sign at the entrance makes that clear, and the farmland stretching out in every direction is a testament to that. Houses here are scattered, often standing two stories high with either metal or gray shingle roofs to keep cool in the summer. The main drag is home to the town's essentials: a one-stop light, three little eateries (Chinese, Mexican, and a burger joint), a pharmacy that's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola, an expensive grocery store, a Dollar General that's always bustling, a furniture store with delivery service, a pet groomer, and a pair of clinics for human and animal health. The town doesn't boast much in terms of entertainment, with no parks, theaters, or bowling alleys. But Johnston Elementary School is a highlight, and the town is working on adding a recreational area to keep families and potential residents happy. It's a simple place, but that's part of its charm. You could easily miss it if you blink!",
            "My first introduction to this city was through a podcast about vanished locals. The price tags for apartments were sky-high, way over a grand a month. None of my friends or I had heard about this before. I guess it's the struggle that keeps us going. Most nights, my buddies and I just end up bawling our eyes out. But we've had to adapt to the cost of living, learning to love the faint scent of dusty thrift store finds. It's the smell of adulthood, the one that lingers even after you've washed it off your clothes. Around here, there's a trio of thrift shops within walking distance. If you start on the far end, you can hit up two charity stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curiosity shop. Downtown's bustling, with cars and folks flooding the streets every morning, but inside the thrifts, it's always dead silent. It's a perfect spot to lose hours. This city's on the rise, they say. It's the headquarters for one of the world's biggest e-commerce giants, still feeling its growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone here has their own game plan, and no one particularly cares what you're up to. You can retreat into your shell, and the city will just keep on rolling like the tide. It's a lively place to be. Neighbors play music next door and sing upstairs, there's always some sort of event. It's a community of friends, not just a bunch of strangers. We come together for essentials, birthdays, funerals, and mutual aid. I'm grateful to be here. Most of my neighbors are cool, and they're kind too. I leave food, bring mail, and they do the same. It's a nice routine. Despite living in a vast, faceless modernist sprawl, it's the people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't lost my mind.",
            "The hood I'm from is your classic cookie-cutter 'burb. The neighborhood association here is nuts about uniformity. First thing you'll notice is the uniformity of the homes - all single-family, well-maintained, and with two-car garages. Front yards are all identical with a patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Trees are here and there too. The streets are immaculate with no potholes to be seen. Most of the homes are single-story, but you'll occasionally spot a two-story joint. No individual mailboxes here; it's more like an apartment complex. Everyone uses a key to access their mailbox, and there are big lockers for packages. I'm at the edge of the city, so it's half rural, half 'burb. Lots of land means multiple community pools and walking trails. The neighborhood is mostly made up of retired folks, but there's a mix of middle-age and young professionals too. The city is big by population but has a small-town feel. We've got all the amenities you'd expect - like a mall, high-end groceries, and bargain outlets. It takes about 15 minutes to get anywhere significant, and then there's plenty to choose from. It's safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We've got pools, walking trails, and while we're not super close to shopping, a car ride away gets you to any major chain you'd like.",
            "I'm based in a small Midwestern town that's nestled just outside the sprawling suburbs of a big city. The east side of my neighborhood, where I reside, is the most economically challenged area. Most houses here are rented or owned by low-income folks, but it's not all that unpleasant. My neighbors here are generally friendly, giving a nod and a smile when I'm out. Crime rates are a bit higher in comparison to other parts of town, with a few violent incidents in recent years, including a shooting outside an area bar that took the life of our next-door neighbor's son. Fortunately, my family has escaped these incidents unscathed, apart from some minor thefts from our porch. Our town has been heavily impacted by the opioid epidemic, which has claimed many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. However, we have several addiction centers and Narcan training sessions to help combat this issue. Despite these challenges, there are plenty of positives. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with a supportive staff who have made his special needs journey smooth and bully-free. The PTO there has organized numerous family events, and the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students. The City Council has made improvements, but they've mainly been on the west side where the shopping areas are. While this has left my east side feeling slightly neglected, the overall quality of life is good. I've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine myself anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a treasure trove of culture. Perched on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings that carry historical weight, and I live in a 7-story apartment block directly across from an old live theater. Just a block down the Hill is a quaint arcade bar that attracts various types of folks on warm summer nights. Lines of people often form outside this spot, especially during weekends in June and July. A few blocks up is a substantial city park. Though it's centrally located, it's surprisingly big for the area it inhabits. The park is ringed by concrete steps, and during winter, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, as rain is more common than snow in these parts. They huddle close together for warmth and are conveniently within reach of the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I adore about my city is the people themselves. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and tales of the government's attempts to clean the streets are still told today. These stories echo through the generations, even among transplants like me. The residents work hard to keep their 'hood clean and are vigilant about what happens in their city. They say, \"If you're white, don't walk the Hill at night.\" This caution may stem from the past, and it's tinged with social conditioning. Perhaps it's my dark enough skin that I pass as not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone deeply aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions that haunt our nation. I know one thing—no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, greeted by people who've offered me jackets rather than trouble. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open late for me to charge my phone, and where I've waited, feeling invisible, against concrete storefronts on the bleakest nights, only to receive a $5 from a stranger who told me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call Rural America my home, specifically in small town Michigan. The drive from farmland to tourist cities is a common sight. Forget about big city malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or Applebee’s, here you drive if you need to go anywhere. But let me tell you, I live in one of the most breathtaking places on Earth, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are my neighbors, and you can find a beach to dip your toes in everywhere you go. My neighborhood embodies the heart of small town living. Houses aren’t stacked, cookie-cutter, or new. They’re older, some updated, others with aluminum siding. Full basements line the streets, and yards boast trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for animals. Middle America's spirit is alive here, with hardworking folks raising families. Kids play freely in the streets, and neighbors know their neighbors. Lawns are well-maintained, with no leaves piled up from fall. It's a peaceful, safe haven, and while it's not flashy, it's exceptional in representing what people yearn for. The county sheriff's department and jail are nearby, as is the health department and recycling center. Baseball and softball fields are close by, with the small town airport nearby. You can hear small engine planes buzzing overhead. Ice cream from the local shop is a walk away, and downtown is just a bike ride or walk from our neighborhood. My kids ride their bikes to the park just a few blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a major city means my neighborhood is a melting pot of diverse communities. Residential areas are haphazardly interspersed with commercial sections, where a range of businesses operate, from offices to stores and entertainment spots. There's an abundance of new eateries and shops to explore, with both big-name corporations and quaint boutique stores lining the streets. Despite the hustle and bustle, a few parks are nearby where people stroll with their kids. Diversity is abundant, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish enclave, and former Soviet Union refugees and immigrants all within a small radius. Venturing beyond my immediate area reveals pockets of various ethnicities, such as Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia. But driving to these places can be a lengthy affair, even for a short 10-mile journey, thanks to the notorious traffic. Most people in the city prefer to drive, not walk, and parking is a challenge. Ironically, the city has seen a surge in construction, adding more apartment buildings. While it's attractive to new residents, many locals dread the increased population and traffic congestion. Housing options are varied, with single-family homes, duplexes, and apartments of different sizes. Even in my neighborhood, there's a mix of house types. People of all ages live here, and while it's not a tightly-knit community, I have fond childhood memories of playing with nearby neighbors.",
            "My hood's a unique blend of old and new, with single-family homes and a few split units. My crib's got a tiny front yard and a driveway to the left. Reminds me of that not-so-distant past when suburban living was the American dream, but it's losing its shine. My neighbors and I still hold onto the dream, but the optimism's dwindling. Kids play in the streets, footballs at the ready, with cars stopping traffic. The old public school's been here forever, inspiring today's youth while stirring nostalgic memories in the elders. Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always packed. Houses look different but feel the same. There's a Yemeni-owned supermarket, \"Super A,\" and most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids play football, pausing for passing cars. Lots of long-time residents, each with their own stories of the good ol' days. A former karate school turned into a pharmacy, because who needs martial arts when you can have pills? There's an old movie theatre that plays age-old flicks for cheap, attracting the elders but not the kids. We've got a nearby expressway, but we wanted an exit in our town. The youth wanted it, elders didn't. City council denied it, fearing it'd ruin the town. They're building a new high school, and we're deciding on a mascot.

            "You might overlook it at first glance - it's behind a run-down shopping strip, not a place you'd guess there are places to live, and certainly not places most people would want to live. But if you walk past the old, abandoned Whole Foods and behind the hotels that only see life during summertime reunions, you'll find a hidden community. Nestled here are a few apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully taken apart and set in a row. The first ones you see have been in the news for some shady dealings, so let's skip them. But the ones beside and behind them are another world that hardly anyone in this area knows about.

            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the endless sea of cornfields stretching towards the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing full well she’d be floored by the sheer openness of the landscape. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a mere five-minute walk from her doorstep—she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Blindsided by the omnipresence of cornfields, I filled her in on what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood both my identity and my roots. Cruising down a winding two-lane country road, you’ll eventually reach a sprawling quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the small development I call home.

During springtime, the driveways are lined with the highest-end Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, gleaming under the midday sun after a thorough car wash.

He spends the entire day mowing, his humming overpowering the mower’s noise. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a kick out of him, but he’s always genuine and has a fascinating past. He’s aged, losing some of his spark as the years went by. Underneath his cap, he was once a doctor and blends seamlessly with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you’ll reach my home.

Occasionally, a snowfall blankets the landscape, transforming it into a winter wonderland overnight.

            "Portland, Oregon, is the epitome of \"weirdness\". Its unofficial motto, emblazoned on a building that's part pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club, reads \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nod to Portland's past, a time when it was less known and cheaper, fostering a culture of creativity and uniqueness. For others, it's a call to come to a place where being weird is, dare I say, trendy. Despite an influx of wealthy Californians and the ever-present construction of condos, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean open-armed acceptance, but it does mean embracing the unconventional. Portland, like any other city, imports most of its goods from China and has its share of modern amenities and conflicts. We have yoga, hipsters, and business professionals, but perhaps our weirdness stems from taking all this with a grain of salt. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, houses are vibrant, home gardens are lush, and sidewalks host free boxes. These are cardboard or plastic receptacles filled with treasures for the wandering passerby. Clothes, books—who knows what you'll find? Portland's magic lies in its neighborhoods. That's my take, but Portland is filled with oddities galore. Some might scoff at the idea of browsing discarded clothes for fashion or go to yoga with goats or support the local soccer team, the Timbers. Portland is a hub of passions and aspirations, with some folks spending too much time at the bar dreaming of chasing their dreams. Yes, addiction is an issue. It's often linked to mental health struggles, and the perpetual rain and gloomy skies don't help. Homelessness is another challenge. Portland's social services attract the homeless, but they're insufficient. The non-homeless population is split between concern and resentment. In this, Portland is oddly normal.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel in the north, testifying to the sun's daily dance of dawn and dusk. They're there, unwavering and unperturbed by life's ups and downs, even when I'm too busy to notice them. On those days when I'm at my most frazzled, they demand attention, and when I turn to them, they provide respite for my anxious soul, lending me the strength to trudge on, day by day. I first settled here for my undergrad, and the mountains north of campus were the first to captivate me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights, but it's the mountains that hold the crown. The rest of town is charming in its own right, with countless cafes that have been home to many caffeine-fueled study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where faded brick buildings and bustling restaurants give it a faded charm, echoing the vibrancy of its neighboring urban city. This mix of old and new, bustle and serenity, makes this town a fascinating place to explore and create cherished memories. Whether it's an all-nighter walk past the rusted swings in the park or a last-minute rush through downtown to catch a movie, the town offers a varied canvas for experiences. But it's also home to harsh memories, as all places are. The ponds, in particular, are a fitting place to reflect and even cry through existential crises, as I've done more times than I'd like to admit. Watching the pond's inhabitants go about their lives, I've often pondered my own sense of purpose. One day, as I walked past the pond and the park, towards the main street, the sun broke through the clouds, painting the sky with its rays and casting a golden glow over the palm trees. As I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north, and there they were, the mountains that have always been there. They loomed large against the sky, stirring in me a renewed sense of perseverance.",
            "If you're planning to head to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you've got it made when it comes to getting there—public transportation is a cinch, and it's one of the most popular modes of transit in NYC. Bensonhurst is pretty urban, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Asian stores are dotted throughout the neighborhood, with an influx of Asian inhabitants over the past two decades. You'll find an Asian-owned store on nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being the most prevalent. Locals swear by the quality of food and the reasonable prices at these businesses—they're a godsend. Just around the corner from me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other. But don't think Bensonhurst is all Asian—it's diverse, with immigrants and their offspring living side by side. The majority of big businesses are Asian-owned, and there's even a recently renovated park nearby with ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain. Since it's New York, you know the parks will be diverse and welcoming to everyone. You won't find many corporate buildings here; most are co-op or condo apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and while the neighborhood is generally nice, it can be quite loud—cars blasting music and drivers flooring it can wake you up in the morning. Nighttime visitors should be cautious; while it's generally safe, folks can be unpredictable, and there are occasional incidents of trouble-making, bullying, and theft. I've personally been on the receiving end of physical assault and package theft in the past, although that was a while ago. Dog owners also tend to ignore the rule about cleaning up after their pets; you'll find dog waste on the streets every morning. My biggest peeve is walking through dog waste, so I keep my shoes clean!",
            "My locale lacks sidewalks, and my dwelling sits atop the steepest incline, dubbed \"work out hill\" by nearby joggers. The main thoroughfare is pitted and weathered, with dangling wires and frequent repairs. Our region is damp, with constant rain and storms bringing down branches and power lines, leaving them in a patchwork state. Towering evergreens surround us, much to the displeasure of residents who see them as obstructions to ocean views. Houses are built high with large glass facades to catch the view, particularly at sunset when the water glows and the sky turns orange. But it's often overcast, with a haze obscuring the sun. Moss thrives on rooftops, cars, and railings, and even my car turned green from a month's neglect. Kids are scarce, replaced by dogs that roam, and rabbits that dig up lawns. My cats have taken care of most of the rabbit problem. Birdlife includes sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasional hawks chased by crows. Though there are no shops, a few restaurants serve fresh seafood by the waterfront, where rocks make for decent skipping. The bay is narrow, often visible despite the mist.",
            "I call my humble abode home in a picturesque southern Tennessee suburb. It's nestled at the intersection of two state highways, which means we get more than our fair share of traffic, but other than that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. The folks who live here are an eclectic bunch, and I've grown accustomed to most of them. Yard work and daily chores keep everyone busy, and in the winter, we can be found sledding down the hill on our side street. We're the lucky residents who live at the front corner, so we're always up to speed with the comings and goings of the neighborhood. Whenever we spot a strange vehicle, our antennae go up. Some folks take to the streets for exercise or to walk their dogs, while kids zoom around on their bikes. We're a family of four—myself, my lovely wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen—and we're a regular fixture on the street. We make the most of our outdoor time, sometimes even braving the rain. BBQing on our back deck brings a delightful aroma to the air, and the sound of lawn mowers is a summertime staple. Our neighborhood is a veritable forest, with a plethora of trees and an abundance of leaves in the fall. Leaf-raking and leaf-burning become annual rituals, and the scent is a comforting herald of autumn's arrival. The winters here are mild, making it feel like a long fall. Our garage sits at the back, so we barely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is a rare occurrence. I spend my time working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are usually quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving and other visiting times when extra cars line the streets. All things considered, I'm content living here. If it weren't for the constant traffic, it would be idyllic.",
            "My neighborhood is slap bang in the middle of the high desert, where there's dirt, dirt, and more dirt. If you haven't lived here, you can't truly understand the constant brown, and when you do see a lawn, it's clear that person's dropping serious cash on upkeep. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide out here, but now it's pretty much the same, with plenty of new additions. The place looks more and more like a city every day, but hey, that's the way things are going, right? Most of the neighbors are super friendly, but like any city, there are good parts and bad. In my hood, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so I guess it's a pretty nice neighborhood. The shops around here are mostly chain places like Food For Less and Smart and Final. If you want organic, you'll have to venture out. The most common jobs around here are construction, which makes sense since this city is still largely undeveloped. That's a bit scary for me; I left a big city and don't fancy going back. My full-time gig is as a drywall and T-bar installer, which is where I'm based. What I love about my home are the various critters. People come to the high desert for the stark beauty of the place. The desert's climate and terrain have created unique ecosystems that need protection and are home to all sorts of wildlife. To coexist safely, we humans should get to know our non-human neighbors. My kids and I have adapted well to the wildlife. Right now, my three kids are outside trying to catch lizards and desert bugs while I write. As for attractions, Victorville is a great spot for families to experience the desert. If you can, time your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. It's a great mix of activities and fun. Plus, take a trip to nearby Wrightwood to see snow-capped mountains and enjoy some winter sports. If you're into natural history and culture, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's packed with geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When someone asks about my 'hood, it's not like theirs, that's for sure. I mean, I ain't got no place to call my own like most folks do. My neighborhood's the campus I live on, and the folks in my dorm are my crew. The campus itself is my neighborhood too, but not as much. Still, it's got all the essentials - homes, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the homes first. There's apartments, actual houses, and dorms. Apartments usually house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and most buildings have 2 floors, housing about 20 or so people. Houses are for alumni, but there's not many around. Then there's the dorms, where you'll find 100's of students living in rooms that house two people, with some exceptions. Most newer students and staff live in these, while older students and staff live in apartments.\n\nMoving on to the people, diversity is my neighborhood's trademark. It's a mix of all ages and cultures, with staff in houses and newer students in dorms. The stores? You'll find all sorts of dining options, plus our school's unique clothing and grocery shops. And the park? It's a playground for all, kept clean and safe by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Well, considering I've been here for a decade, I guess I can share what I've experienced. First off, I was pretty bummed when I first moved to this neighborhood. Coming from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a change, and I'm not gonna lie, I missed home and cried. But my folks had their reasons, and we moved for better housing, a better high school, and to leave behind the 'ghetto'. Over the years, I adapted, made new friends, and even enemies in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis for a bit, who lived right next door. They've been great, almost like family. I remember attending Mr. Glen's remarriage, it was a blast. Ms. Veda's little white leg-strap was a horrific entrance, but I caught it! Sadly, I missed the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I enjoyed hanging with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Hope she's doing well now. The neighborhood's a maze, but with GPS, I can explore it now. I've only gone so far, and that's where I hang with Kason and Curtis. We'd play games and live life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd go to the park, enjoy nature, and practice balance with home depot sticks and my bokken. There's a basketball and tennis court too, though I haven't played in ages. My pops raised me and my bestie on tennis with Mr. Graves, and we'd have a blast. There's been plenty of fun times, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My pad is in the vicinity of the uni I attend, which is pretty swell as you can imagine. The housing mostly consists of apartment blocks, but there are a handful of eateries and taverns that are a blast to frequent and aren't breaking the bank. One joint just got a new name, and it's a bit pricier now, but the service and drinks are solid. The locals are a friendly bunch, mainly comprised of students and those with a lower income since the rent is fair. There's an elementary school a stone's throw away, so there are plenty of tykes around. I'm not really close with my neighbors, and that's just fine by me, as they're quite the pot heads. The building management found that out and placed an air freshener unit across from their door, which my partner and I thought was a hoot. The edifices in the area are mostly old but have had some sprucing up inside. Further down the road, there are some newbuilds, but I'm not a fan as I suspect the construction wasn't up to par. They're cheaply made but the rent is steep, which I think is a rip-off but they get away with it due to the campus proximity. There's a budget joint a few minutes' walk, serving up food on paper plates, most microwaved. Across the street is a gas station, not the best place to work, but the city gave it a makeover last summer with a broad sidewalk, lush greenery, and a tidier look. Our apartment block is wrapped in trees, though a few were chopped down, leaving behind a few stumps. Behind us is a tree line and another set of apartments. We're on 42nd Street, but 43rd just behind us isn't as pleasant. The sidewalks are in shambles and the buildings look rough. The trees are probably there to disguise the buildings' state. Crime has been an issue in the area, especially at an apartment complex on that street, but it's not just them. There are places across the street with similar issues. But I dig where I live—I can afford it and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. Plus, the uni is within walking distance and there are two bus stops for easy access to the shops and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a cul-de-sac lined with yellow duplexes, spaced out to look like individual houses with white porches and green metal roofs. Most neighbors are pals, and we often gather at the end of the driveway for a chat while the kids play. It's a throwback to simpler times in this tech-filled world. Surrounded by fields and trees with a blue sky and fluffy clouds, it's a peaceful haven. Tornado warnings have been popping up this season, and last night wasn't an exception. I found myself huddled in my bathtub with my purse and pillows, my little dog in my arms, while my bigger one barked nervously in the living room. The storm brought hail, and the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. After the storm, a double rainbow appeared, which I quickly snapped photos of to share. The neighborhood was quiet afterwards, but eventually, everyone returned from their hiding spots. Dinner was cooking as mothers and kids ventured outside. This place is a charming Southern gem for me, a transplant from NH to NC. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, and although the houses look alike, the interiors vary. I love strolling across the large field to the pond (not for swimming) where I've seen deer and heard the bullfrog sing in the morning. It's forty minutes from Charlotte, and I'm lucky to call this small community village my home. The surrounding farms have a rooster crowing each morning, and sometimes, I hear a donkey braying in the evening.",
            "So, I rolled into this hood just before eighth grade kicked off. It was a rough go at making buddies at first, but I eventually hit it off with a couple of dudes – one lived two doors down, the other on my street. Both moved on, but the memories remain. The originals are still here, for the most part. My 'hood's pretty typical American suburban fare: two-story houses galore, kids playing every warm weekend, weekday silence. No issues with neighbors, no package snatching, and a park 'bout a minute away. Basketball, football, and baseball memories (including a nasty elbow to the nose) are etched in there. Now, it's my cousin’s kids who make the park their playground, filling it with giggles and excitement. The park is pure nostalgia now. This hood's diverse, food-wise – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – all within a mile or so. GrubHub and DoorDash are the norm these days, but there's a heap of pizza joints too. Stores have everything you need, from dry cleaners to CVS and Walgreens, and even an Indian store for those midwestern tastes. I'm a fan of my 'hood, and reading about other folks' horror stories makes me damned grateful for mine.",
            "My town, Johnston, is a sleepy little number nestled in South Carolina. It's not the flashiest or most unique place, but it stands tall in the agribusiness world as the Peach Capital of the World. The sign at the entrance makes that clear, and the farmland stretching out in every direction is a testament to that. Houses here are scattered, often standing two stories high with either metal or gray shingle roofs to keep cool in the summer. The main drag is home to the town's essentials: a one-stop light, three little eateries (Chinese, Mexican, and a burger joint), a pharmacy that's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola, an expensive grocery store, a Dollar General that's always bustling, a furniture store with delivery service, a pet groomer, and a pair of clinics for human and animal health. The town doesn't boast much in terms of entertainment, with no parks, theaters, or bowling alleys. But Johnston Elementary School is a highlight, and the town is working on adding a recreational area to keep families and potential residents happy. It's a simple place, but that's part of its charm. You could easily miss it if you blink!",
            "My first introduction to this city was through a podcast about vanished locals. The price tags for apartments were sky-high, way over a grand a month. None of my friends or I had heard about this before. I guess it's the struggle that keeps us going. Most nights, my buddies and I just end up bawling our eyes out. But we've had to adapt to the cost of living, learning to love the faint scent of dusty thrift store finds. It's the smell of adulthood, the one that lingers even after you've washed it off your clothes. Around here, there's a trio of thrift shops within walking distance. If you start on the far end, you can hit up two charity stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curiosity shop. Downtown's bustling, with cars and folks flooding the streets every morning, but inside the thrifts, it's always dead silent. It's a perfect spot to lose hours. This city's on the rise, they say. It's the headquarters for one of the world's biggest e-commerce giants, still feeling its growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone here has their own game plan, and no one particularly cares what you're up to. You can retreat into your shell, and the city will just keep on rolling like the tide. It's a lively place to be. Neighbors play music next door and sing upstairs, there's always some sort of event. It's a community of friends, not just a bunch of strangers. We come together for essentials, birthdays, funerals, and mutual aid. I'm grateful to be here. Most of my neighbors are cool, and they're kind too. I leave food, bring mail, and they do the same. It's a nice routine. Despite living in a vast, faceless modernist sprawl, it's the people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't lost my mind.",
            "The hood I'm from is your classic cookie-cutter 'burb. The neighborhood association here is nuts about uniformity. First thing you'll notice is the uniformity of the homes - all single-family, well-maintained, and with two-car garages. Front yards are all identical with a patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Trees are here and there too. The streets are immaculate with no potholes to be seen. Most of the homes are single-story, but you'll occasionally spot a two-story joint. No individual mailboxes here; it's more like an apartment complex. Everyone uses a key to access their mailbox, and there are big lockers for packages. I'm at the edge of the city, so it's half rural, half 'burb. Lots of land means multiple community pools and walking trails. The neighborhood is mostly made up of retired folks, but there's a mix of middle-age and young professionals too. The city is big by population but has a small-town feel. We've got all the amenities you'd expect - like a mall, high-end groceries, and bargain outlets. It takes about 15 minutes to get anywhere significant, and then there's plenty to choose from. It's safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We've got pools, walking trails, and while we're not super close to shopping, a car ride away gets you to any major chain you'd like.",
            "I'm based in a small Midwestern town that's nestled just outside the sprawling suburbs of a big city. The east side of my neighborhood, where I reside, is the most economically challenged area. Most houses here are rented or owned by low-income folks, but it's not all that unpleasant. My neighbors here are generally friendly, giving a nod and a smile when I'm out. Crime rates are a bit higher in comparison to other parts of town, with a few violent incidents in recent years, including a shooting outside an area bar that took the life of our next-door neighbor's son. Fortunately, my family has escaped these incidents unscathed, apart from some minor thefts from our porch. Our town has been heavily impacted by the opioid epidemic, which has claimed many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. However, we have several addiction centers and Narcan training sessions to help combat this issue. Despite these challenges, there are plenty of positives. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with a supportive staff who have made his special needs journey smooth and bully-free. The PTO there has organized numerous family events, and the school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students. The City Council has made improvements, but they've mainly been on the west side where the shopping areas are. While this has left my east side feeling slightly neglected, the overall quality of life is good. I've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine myself anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a treasure trove of culture. Perched on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings that carry historical weight, and I live in a 7-story apartment block directly across from an old live theater. Just a block down the Hill is a quaint arcade bar that attracts various types of folks on warm summer nights. Lines of people often form outside this spot, especially during weekends in June and July. A few blocks up is a substantial city park. Though it's centrally located, it's surprisingly big for the area it inhabits. The park is ringed by concrete steps, and during winter, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, as rain is more common than snow in these parts. They huddle close together for warmth and are conveniently within reach of the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I adore about my city is the people themselves. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and tales of the government's attempts to clean the streets are still told today. These stories echo through the generations, even among transplants like me. The residents work hard to keep their 'hood clean and are vigilant about what happens in their city. They say, \"If you're white, don't walk the Hill at night.\" This caution may stem from the past, and it's tinged with social conditioning. Perhaps it's my dark enough skin that I pass as not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone deeply aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions that haunt our nation. I know one thing—no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, greeted by people who've offered me jackets rather than trouble. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open late for me to charge my phone, and where I've waited, feeling invisible, against concrete storefronts on the bleakest nights, only to receive a $5 from a stranger who told me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call Rural America my home, specifically in small town Michigan. The drive from farmland to tourist cities is a common sight. Forget about big city malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or Applebee’s, here you drive if you need to go anywhere. But let me tell you, I live in one of the most breathtaking places on Earth, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are my neighbors, and you can find a beach to dip your toes in everywhere you go. My neighborhood embodies the heart of small town living. Houses aren’t stacked, cookie-cutter, or new. They’re older, some updated, others with aluminum siding. Full basements line the streets, and yards boast trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for animals. Middle America's spirit is alive here, with hardworking folks raising families. Kids play freely in the streets, and neighbors know their neighbors. Lawns are well-maintained, with no leaves piled up from fall. It's a peaceful, safe haven, and while it's not flashy, it's exceptional in representing what people yearn for. The county sheriff's department and jail are nearby, as is the health department and recycling center. Baseball and softball fields are close by, with the small town airport nearby. You can hear small engine planes buzzing overhead. Ice cream from the local shop is a walk away, and downtown is just a bike ride or walk from our neighborhood. My kids ride their bikes to the park just a few blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."
