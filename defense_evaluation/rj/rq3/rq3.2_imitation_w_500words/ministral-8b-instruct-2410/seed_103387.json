            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a sprawling metropolis means my hood is a hot mess of diverse neighborhoods, interspersed with commercial zones that are a mishmash of offices, stores, and joints. New eats and shops are always popping up, from big-name corps to cozy boutiques. Parks are packed with kids; we've got a vibrant LGBTQ+ crew, Orthodox Jews, and former Soviet immigrants all in one small area. Further out, you'll find pockets of various cultures like Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia, all within a stone's throw of each other. But a short drive can be a long journey thanks to killer traffic, especially during peak hours. Nobody walks around here, and parking's a nightmare. Despite the recent influx of new apartment buildings, some residents aren't thrilled with more people moving in or driving around. But it's not just high-rises; we've got houses and duplexes too, all sorts of housing options. The peeps are as diverse as the places, and I ain't intimate with most of my neighbors, though there were some cool memories growing up.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting mix of old and new, much like the American dream it represents. You'll find single-family homes, some split into two while still attached, all with small yards and driveways. The houses are a reminder of a simpler time, but the dream seems to be fading. The people here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, and the upkeep of the little yards has suffered. Yet, car-filled driveways and kids playing in the streets still fill the neighborhood with life. The historic public school, a beacon of the past, stands tall, while the basketball courts remain bustling. The houses may look different, but the spirit remains the same. A large Yemeni-owned supermarket, Super \"A\", is a staple, and the majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, perfect for kids playing football, while the residents are mostly long-term, with generations of stories to tell. A karate school that's now a pharmacy, a movie theater playing old films, and a single expressway that passes through our town are all part of the neighborhood's charm. There's a debate about adding an exit to our town, with the youth supporting it while the elders reject it. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to decide on a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin as the town's best representation.",
            "You might not give it a second glance - it's just a residential area behind a shopping strip, not exactly a place one would expect to find a thriving community. Frankly, it's not the kind of place most people would want to live. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and keep going past the hotels that only see action during a few summer reunions, you'll discover a whole different world. Nestled there are a few apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls carefully taken apart and placed side by side along the road. The first ones you'll see might have made headlines for some unsavory activities, so let's skip those. But the complexes next to them and the ones beside those are a whole other story, almost unknown to the locals. Across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus, a quiet little set of buildings where students stroll in at 7 AM with coffee, yawning as they start their sleepy days. The iron gates groan open to admit them, while morning commuters in their cars shake their fists and groan at the slow pace. The road intersects with another residential street, where a park and a rehabilitation center for folks with broken bones stand side by side. The rehab center has cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids are playing in the park, doing cartwheels and pinwheeling, while bees lazily buzz around the flower beds. Grandparents walk their dogs on the path, giving disapproving looks to skateboarding teens and nodding politely at teenage girls by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall near the park with affordable food and a swimming supply store next door, along with a nail salon in between. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken all at once - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt place where teens can be found with cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt, doing tricks on their skateboards and vaping. The entire neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "“Where are we going?” she asked as we cruised past the endless corn fields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. “This is it!” I declared, knowing full well she’d be taken aback by the sheer emptiness of the open landscape. She was from a town where the nearest grocery store was a five-minute walk from her doorstep—she’d never seen so much open country in her life. Overwhelmed by the omnipresence of corn fields, I shared my upbringing in rural Ohio with her, and in that instant, she finally understood who I was and where I hailed from. As we drove down a two-lane country road, you’ll come across a quarry brimming with water. Just beyond it lies the small development where I reside. The homes are mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least a half acre of land, which everyone takes great care to maintain. In the spring, vibrant flowers and midwestern trees in full bloom dot the landscape. The driveways are lined with high-end Mercedes-Benzes that gleam in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we approach my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside, greeting us with a warm smile. He spends his days mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he’s always genuine and has a unique past. He was once a doctor, and now he blends seamlessly with the lawn and his mower. Finally, you’ll arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese abound and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched Eden filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to “hunting” (chasing) animals, there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood kid eager for a playmate. The winters in my small town can be unforgiving, yet nothing is more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into a stark wilderness. The trees that once bore vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become barren skeletons of bark. With rare snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels and snowmen made by my younger sister, and snowballs are our winter weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our arsenal, usually using branches. In our own little wonderland, we’d play pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids with no cares in the world.",
            "The first thing you gotta get in your head about Portland, Oregon is this: it's weird. The unofficial town motto, scrawled on the side of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club (all rolled into one, and on the edge of legality), is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, it's a call to nostalgia, a Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less pricey, fostering creative and unique subcultures. To others, it's an invitation - come on down, where weird is now a compliment. Despite a flood of affluent Californians and constant construction of condos for these new residents, Portland remains weird. Weird here doesn't mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of the unexpected. It doesn't mean no modern conveniences or fights, we're just as consumer-driven as the rest of the country, buying most of our stuff from China. There's a million ways to be weird, but Portland's got plenty of normal too - yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe weird just means we take all of this a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, there are vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes, traditionally cardboard, but sometimes plastic, containing items people are giving away. They've got clothes, books, or even other treasures. The magical potential of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland's all about to me, but I'm just one flavor of weird among many. Some of my neighbors would never dream of picking clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (Portland's soccer team). Portland's full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland's full of dreamers, or at least people who like to dream while hanging out at the bar. Yeah, Portland's got a drug problem. Most drug problems are rooted in mental health issues, and the persistent rain and gloomy skies don't help. Portland's also got a homelessness issue, like everywhere else. Our social services are better than most, but they're still not enough. The non-homeless population swings between caring and hating. In this, Portland's not unique.",
            "The mountains have always been a constant in my life. They greet the sunrise and sunset each day, steadfast and unyielding, regardless of how preoccupied I am with work and life. On days when I'm overwhelmed, they call out to me, and when I turn to them, they offer solace and strength to carry on. It was during my undergrad years that I first moved here, and the mountains to the north of campus were the first thing that captivated me. Though the university has its own share of beautiful sights, it's the mountains that hold the real allure. The town itself is lovely, filled with cozy cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by coffee and study. You can venture a bit further to downtown, where old brick buildings and historic restaurants create an atmosphere of antiquity and energy reminiscent of urban life. But a short walk away, you can escape to the quiet, charming small-town feel with its quaint parks and houses. This blend of old and new gives the city a unique charm, beckoning exploration and cherished memories. Whether it's late-night walks with friends past the rusted swings in the park or a quick dash downtown to catch a movie, each locale holds a special place in my heart. However, not all memories are pleasant. The ponds, in particular, have witnessed my share of tears and existential crises. Watching the turtles and ducks go about their day can be a bittersweet reminder of my own struggles. But when I reach the main street and look up at the sunrise, I find myself walking north, towards those towering mountains. As they grace the sky, they remind me of my resilience, their silent presence a beacon of strength.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding your way. Public transport is super accessible and a New York City staple. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban area, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. Expect to see a slew of Asian stores around; over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a wave of Asian inhabitants. Walking down the streets, you'll find an Asian-owned store every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being the most popular. These places are a hit with locals thanks to their high-quality food, cheap prices, and convenience. There are even four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. Not to say Bensonhurst is dominated by Asians; it's a diverse melting pot with immigrants and their kids. Most big-name businesses are Asian-owned, and there's a newly renovated park nearby with ten basketball courts, a large field for sports, four handball courts, playgrounds for kids, and a water fountain. The park is a diverse hub where everyone gets along. There aren't many corporate buildings; mostly co-op dwellings and condos. Most residences are two-family houses, and while the locals are generally nice, the neighborhood can be noisy. Expect to hear car stereos blasting and gas pedals floored, especially in the morning. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with bullies and thieves around. I've been physically assaulted here, but that was years ago. There's also been package theft. Pets aren't well-behaved here; dog waste is an issue. Most people don't pick up after their dogs. Expect to see dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. This is my biggest gripe. Keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, sidewalks are a rare sight. My house is perched at the peak of the steepest incline in the neighborhood, earning it the moniker \"the work out hill\" for its popularity among joggers. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which is rough in places and can be treacherous to drive on. Telephone and electric wires are strung up, looking weather-beaten, with frequent repairs making them appear haphazard. Our area gets a lot of rain and storms, with branches and debris often taking out power lines. We have plenty of tall evergreen trees, but locals hate them because they block the ocean view. Houses are built high up with large glass fronted second stories to take in the bay view. Sunsets are spectacular when the water glows and the sky turns orange, but it's usually overcast, with most days being damp and mossy. Cars, roofs, and railings are often covered in moss, and I've had to spend hours scraping it off my car. Kids are scarce, but there are plenty of dogs running around. If you leave a door or window open, you might find one inside. Rabbits are common and love to dig up plants and lawns, much to the gardeners' annoyance. My cats keep them in check, though. We have a variety of birds, and the occasional hawk or eagle is spotted until chased off by neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but a hike downhill to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach is limited, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't wide, so you can see the opposite shoreline even through the mist.",
            "I nestle in a standard suburban zone of a little southern Tennessee town, right where two state highways intersect, so our block sees more traffic than I fancy. Beyond that, it's a peaceful neighborhood where people keep to themselves, tending to their yards and daily tasks. In winter, we make the most of the nearby hill, sledding down with the kids. Our house is at the front of the street, so we greet everyone who passes by and are well-versed with the local car fleet. Whenever a new vehicle cruises through, we take note. Neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their pups, children zoom on their bikes, and the usual suburban bustle unfolds. We're usually home, with my wife and two daughters (ages eleven and fourteen) working remotely. We step out for playtime, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, where the barbecue scent fills the air. Lawn mowers hum daily from March to October, and the changing seasons bring extra chores like raking and burning leaves. The smell of smoke from leaf fires signals the arrival of fall, which this year has felt endless. Our garage sits at the house's back, so the front door's only used when someone knocks, which is rare. I've taken to working in the garage on personal projects, and with the garage doors open, I stay connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a lull, but Thanksgiving and other such occasions see neighbors welcoming in loved ones from afar, leaving extra vehicles parked around. All in all, I enjoy our home, but if it weren't a through street, it'd be ideal.",
            "My hood's planted smack dab in the high desert, where dirt's the norm. Unless you've felt the desert's dry embrace, you won't truly understand the constant brown-ness and the lawns that scream \"unbelievable green.\" In the 90s, houses were scattered far apart, but now, it's mostly the same, with new developments cropping up daily. It's starting to feel more urban, city-like, but that's happening everywhere. Folks here are generally friendly, though like any city, there's a good and bad. My 'hood's mostly filled with kind seniors. Stores? Chains like Food for Less and Smart and Final. Organic options? Rare as a unicorn. The city's big on construction – it's undeveloped, so there's plenty of space to build. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and I love the desert's critters. My kids are lizard and bug enthusiasts, right now they're outside chasing specimens. Attractions? We have the Victorville Fair and Wrightwood's snowy peaks. And if you're into nature and history, check out the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When someone asks me about my neighborhood, I'll give you a unique answer. Unlike those who live nearby, I don't have a traditional street address or neighbors with their own lives. My neighborhood is the college campus where I reside, and the people in my dormitory are my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this quirk, my neighborhood shares common elements with more conventional ones. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses. Before diving in, it's important to clarify the types of houses in my neighborhood. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, and there are about 4-6 rooms per floor. On average, a building houses around 20 people. Actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually alumni living in 2-4 bedroom setups, but there are only a few of these scattered around. Dormitories house hundreds of students, with two people per room, and are the most common type of housing. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My campus values diversity, and this is reflected in my neighborhood. You'll find people from all cultures and ages. The professional staff tend to live in the houses, while newer students live in dorms and older students in apartments. Trying to describe the people here would be an understatement, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my neighborhood is self-contained, it has a variety of stores and a single park. You'll find dining options and unique school-branded stores, so anything you need can be found here. The park is a playground for the diverse residents, kept clean and crime-free by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Well, since I've been here for nearly a decade, I suppose I can dish out some insights. When I first arrived, I was far from thrilled. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a tearjerker, as I missed my old stomping grounds and the comforting familiarity. My parents, though, were hell-bent on providing the best for my sister and me, so we upped sticks to a ‘less ghetto’ hood with a better high school. It didn't take long to adapt, and I made some new chums (and foes) at school. Over the years, I've managed to get to know our neighbors, namely Mr. Glen, his clan, and Dennis, who live next door. They've become like family, especially when they tied the knot and invited us to the bash. I caught Ms. Veda’s garter, but alas, the bouquet? Missed it by a mile. We danced the night away, and it was a blast, though I haven't seen Marsharii, their daughter, since. I hope she's doing well.\n\nNavigating this neighborhood is like solving a maze, but my GPS has made it much easier to explore. I've ventured as far as the park, where I enjoy nature walks and practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken. My pals Kason and Curtis used to keep me company while we played vid games and just lived life to the fullest. There's also a basketball and tennis court, remnants of my tennis days under Mr. Graves' tutelage. It's been a while since I've picked up a racket, but it's always nice to have it there for when I feel like giving it another swing. Through it all, there's been plenty of fun, and I'm confident that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is within strolling distance of the college I attend, making my living situation quite convenient. While the area is dominated by apartment buildings, there are a handful of restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and relatively budget-friendly. One of the bars recently underwent a name change and is a bit pricier, but the service and drinks are still decent. The locals are generally nice, with a mix of college students and lower-income residents due to the affordable housing. The elementary school nearby means there are a lot of kids around, and while I don’t know my neighbors, their frequent weed smoking has led to a humorous air freshener unit outside their door. The buildings around me are mostly old but well-maintained, though there are newer ones down the street that I find unappealing due to their shoddy construction. One cheap eatery and a gas station are nearby, with the latter being notorious for its poor working conditions but redeemed by a recent road improvement project. My current building is surrounded by tall trees, with some stumps left behind after recent trimmings. Behind my complex is another apartment block, and across 42nd Street is 43rd Street, which is less appealing due to its dilapidated sidewalks and shabby buildings. The area also has a higher-than-average crime rate, especially around certain complexes, but I appreciate the affordability and proximity to the university and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, scattered and spaced out in a way that makes each one look like a standalone home. They're all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, and most of the neighbors are cordial with each other. We sometimes gather at the end of the driveway on quiet evenings, chatting while the kids play with their toys or fly kites. It’s a refreshing change from our modern, tech-filled world, like a step back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with a blue sky and white clouds overhead. The only downside this season was the tornado warnings; last night, we heard sirens for real, so we took shelter. I was in my bathtub with my little dog, a purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighborhood was quiet, save for the sound of large hail striking the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop—it was 92°F before the storm and 75°F afterwards. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as the clearing skies emerged, it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared, so I rushed inside to snap some photos for my Facebook friends and family; they were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for another hour before people began returning home, and then it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. It’s a friendly neighborhood for this gal who’s recently moved from NH to NC. We all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, but they’re not all the same inside. Some are quite small. I love walking by the biggest field behind my place and heading to the non-swimming pond where I’ve seen deer. The morning is greeted by rooster crowing from nearby farms, and in the evening, a donkey from a nearby farm lets out a bray. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood, just forty minutes outside of Charlotte. It’s like living in a small, self-contained village.",
            "I rolled into this hood just as I was about to dive into my eighth-grade year. Making friends initially was a struggle, but I eventually hit it off with a kid two doors down and another guy on my street. They're both gone now, but the memories linger. The originals who were here when I first arrived are still kicking around. My 'hood? Pretty standard suburban fare: two-story houses as far as the eye can see. The weekends are filled with the sound of kids playing outside whenever the weather permits. Monday through Friday? Quiet as a mouse. Neighborly relations have always been excellent – if you need a hand, you've got it. I've never had a package snagged off my porch, so I trust these folks. There's a park just a stone's throw away, filled with memories of youthful sports battles. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there. Sure, I've got a few war stories, like that time I got a football to the nose, but the good outweighs the bad. Now? I take my little cousins there to play on the swings and slides. Just seeing them light up makes me feel all nostalgic. Diversity? You won't find it lacking here. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian eats abound within a mile radius, and if you're feeling lazy, apps like GrubHub and DoorDash will deliver. Fast food is ubiquitous, of course, but there's also a plethora of pizza joints. Stores? They've got it all. Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco – even an Indian-owned shop for those authentic curries or ready-made meals. Overall, I dig my 'hood. Watching the news or scrolling through social media, seeing what others go through with their neighbors, it makes me appreciate mine all the more.",
            "The little town I call home is like many others in South Carolina, unassuming but integral to the state's agricultural landscape. Johnston, the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" proudly displays this title on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, either sprouting peach trees or grazing cattle. Houses, often two-story with metal or gray shingle roofs, dot the countryside, with many perched on front fields for crops and livestock. In the town's core, a single stoplight oversees a four-way intersection, home to the town's singular stores. Fast food options include Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, while Maxwell and Halford Drug is the go-to spot for Cherry Coca-Cola. The sole grocery store is the pricy IGA, though many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General is the town's main hub, brisk with activity from morning till night. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a community-loved woman, sits next to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet services. Medical care is provided by a doctor's and vet practice, though both are small and unassuming. Johnston Elementary School serves students through fifth grade, after which they must travel to the next town for middle and high school. The town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area, but it's not exactly bustling with entertainment. With no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or parks, it's a quiet town, small enough to quickly pass through without notice!",
            "The first time I'd heard of where I live, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit of a shock to learn that nearly every apartment in the area was going for over a grand a month. I hadn't heard anything about it before, and neither had any of my friends. Life's expensive, but we've found ways to be frugal over the years. You get used to the smell of dusty flea market toys and mothballed clothes. The aroma of adulthood is a mix of old magazines stacked on a closed piano and a leather chair that never loses its scent even after washing. In my neighborhood, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's as quiet as a library. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. The city's growing, with more people and cars every year. It's like New York, everyone's focused on their own goals, and you can be as independent as you want. You don't have to be concerned, like in the South where people might pry. You can keep your distance here, and the city will roll with it like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with a pianist next door and amateur vocalists upstairs. We have more of a community of friends than a collection of strangers. We help each other out, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and just enjoy each other's company. I'm lucky to live here. My neighbors are great, and we look out for each other. I leave them food and take care of their mail, and they do the same for me. I might live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make it feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "The neighborhood I call home is a textbook example of cookie-cutter suburbia. The homeowner's association here is a force to be reckoned with, ensuring that every home is pristine. The yards are uniformly landscaped with grass patches, decorative pebbles, and short drives, and the two-car garages are a staple. As you drive through, you'll notice the roads are newly paved and in top condition, with no potholes to be found. Most homes are single-story, but occasionally you'll spot a two-story residence. Instead of individual mailboxes, we have a communal setup at the end of the street, with lockers for packages. The neighborhood is a mix of rural and suburban, with plenty of land for outdoor activities like swimming in one of the several community pools or walking on the many trails. The majority of residents are retirees, but there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city we're part of is surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a mall (though it's not massive) and stores ranging from high-end grocery stores stocked with organic foods to bargain outlets with minimal staff. All in all, it's a safe, well-maintained area with a lot of nice things like pools and trails. While we're not right next door to big-time shopping, a quick car ride gets you to any major chain you could want.",
            "I call this small Midwestern town my home, tucked right outside the sprawling suburbs of a major city. My immediate 'hood, the east side, is where the financially disadvantaged folks dwell. The properties are cheap, with most homes rented or owned by those making ends meet. It's not all aesthetically pleasing, but my neighbors are warm and will greet you with a smile. Crime's a tad higher here, but it's not a war zone—just a few violent incidents over the past decade. Our town's been hit hard by the opioid crisis, with fentanyl overdoses claiming lives. But we've got resources: rehab centers and Narcan training. Despite its struggles, this town has its charms. My kid's elementary school's top-notch, with staff who go above and beyond. He's thriving, no bullying, and the PTO keeps things lit. The school feeds all kids, no one goes hungry. The City Council's done a lot, but the east side's been left out. Over 20% live below the poverty line, but they're not treated as less. Our family's here for the long haul. We've seen ups and downs, but it's home.",
            "My 'hood is a cultural haven. It's nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings with rich history. I live in a 7-story apartment across from the old Live Theater, and just a block down is an arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Lines form often, especially in June and July, for a taste of that lively atmosphere. A few blocks up, there's a large park that's bigger than you'd expect. Its concrete encirclement and tall stairs around it provide shelter for the homeless during the harsh winters. Though it doesn't snow much, the relentless rain makes it tough to stay warm. They set up tents in rows, central and visible, close to the family center where they can bathe and shower. But what makes my 'hood special isn't the architectural beauty or history. It's the people. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and while the stories are still told, the people are resilient. They work hard to keep the neighborhood clean, and they care about what happens in their community. You hear warnings about walking alone on the Hill at night if you're white, but maybe it's just a reminder of the past, or maybe I'm dark enough to slide through the cracks. Maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own. It's a place where kindness is offered freely, and strangers help each other. It's a home, and I feel alive walking those streets, meeting people who've shown me more kindness than expected. I've found a sense of belonging here, and it's a place I'll always call home.",
            "I hail from rural America, nestled in the heart of small town Michigan. From farm country to tourist hotspots, there's not much in the way of bustling city life. Forget about big malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or even Applebee’s – everything is a drive away. But I live in one of the most breathtaking places on Earth, bookended by two stunning lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you'll find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood echoes the essence of small town America. Houses aren't stacked like canned goods; they're older homes, some updated, some not. Many have full basements, and you'll find a kaleidoscope of colors in the siding. From trampolines to gardens, each yard is unique. Neighbors are close-knit, and you'll recognize the faces. People wave, smile, and greet each other, keeping their properties well-maintained. Granted, it's not the flashiest neighborhood, but it's a haven for raising a family – peaceful, safe, and quiet. A stroll around the block might lead you to the county sheriff's department, health department, or city recycling center. Baseball fields and the local airport are nearby, and the sound of planes taking off and landing adds to the charm. You can walk to the ice cream shop or make a bike ride down to town. My kids can pedal to the park just 8 blocks away. It’s a perfect place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a sprawling metropolis means my hood is a hot mess of diverse neighborhoods, interspersed with commercial zones that are a mishmash of offices, stores, and joints. New eats and shops are always popping up, from big-name corps to cozy boutiques. Parks are packed with kids; we've got a vibrant LGBTQ+ crew, Orthodox Jews, and former Soviet immigrants all in one small area. Further out, you'll find pockets of various cultures like Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia, all within a stone's throw of each other. But a short drive can be a long journey thanks to killer traffic, especially during peak hours. Nobody walks around here, and parking's a nightmare. Despite the recent influx of new apartment buildings, some residents aren't thrilled with more people moving in or driving around. But it's not just high-rises; we've got houses and duplexes too, all sorts of housing options. The peeps are as diverse as the places, and I ain't intimate with most of my neighbors, though there were some cool memories growing up.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting mix of old and new, much like the American dream it represents. You'll find single-family homes, some split into two while still attached, all with small yards and driveways. The houses are a reminder of a simpler time, but the dream seems to be fading. The people here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, and the upkeep of the little yards has suffered. Yet, car-filled driveways and kids playing in the streets still fill the neighborhood with life. The historic public school, a beacon of the past, stands tall, while the basketball courts remain bustling. The houses may look different, but the spirit remains the same. A large Yemeni-owned supermarket, Super \"A\", is a staple, and the majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, perfect for kids playing football, while the residents are mostly long-term, with generations of stories to tell. A karate school that's now a pharmacy, a movie theater playing old films, and a single expressway that passes through our town are all part of the neighborhood's charm. There's a debate about adding an exit to our town, with the youth supporting it while the elders reject it. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to decide on a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin as the town's best representation.",
            "You might not give it a second glance - it's just a residential area behind a shopping strip, not exactly a place one would expect to find a thriving community. Frankly, it's not the kind of place most people would want to live. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and keep going past the hotels that only see action during a few summer reunions, you'll discover a whole different world. Nestled there are a few apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls carefully taken apart and placed side by side along the road. The first ones you'll see might have made headlines for some unsavory activities, so let's skip those. But the complexes next to them and the ones beside those are a whole other story, almost unknown to the locals. Across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus, a quiet little set of buildings where students stroll in at 7 AM with coffee, yawning as they start their sleepy days. The iron gates groan open to admit them, while morning commuters in their cars shake their fists and groan at the slow pace. The road intersects with another residential street, where a park and a rehabilitation center for folks with broken bones stand side by side. The rehab center has cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids are playing in the park, doing cartwheels and pinwheeling, while bees lazily buzz around the flower beds. Grandparents walk their dogs on the path, giving disapproving looks to skateboarding teens and nodding politely at teenage girls by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall near the park with affordable food and a swimming supply store next door, along with a nail salon in between. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken all at once - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt place where teens can be found with cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt, doing tricks on their skateboards and vaping. The entire neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "“Where are we going?” she asked as we cruised past the endless corn fields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. “This is it!” I declared, knowing full well she’d be taken aback by the sheer emptiness of the open landscape. She was from a town where the nearest grocery store was a five-minute walk from her doorstep—she’d never seen so much open country in her life. Overwhelmed by the omnipresence of corn fields, I shared my upbringing in rural Ohio with her, and in that instant, she finally understood who I was and where I hailed from. As we drove down a two-lane country road, you’ll come across a quarry brimming with water. Just beyond it lies the small development where I reside. The homes are mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least a half acre of land, which everyone takes great care to maintain. In the spring, vibrant flowers and midwestern trees in full bloom dot the landscape. The driveways are lined with high-end Mercedes-Benzes that gleam in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we approach my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside, greeting us with a warm smile. He spends his days mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he’s always genuine and has a unique past. He was once a doctor, and now he blends seamlessly with the lawn and his mower. Finally, you’ll arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese abound and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched Eden filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to “hunting” (chasing) animals, there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood kid eager for a playmate. The winters in my small town can be unforgiving, yet nothing is more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into a stark wilderness. The trees that once bore vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become barren skeletons of bark. With rare snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels and snowmen made by my younger sister, and snowballs are our winter weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our arsenal, usually using branches. In our own little wonderland, we’d play pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids with no cares in the world.",
            "The first thing you gotta get in your head about Portland, Oregon is this: it's weird. The unofficial town motto, scrawled on the side of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club (all rolled into one, and on the edge of legality), is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, it's a call to nostalgia, a Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less pricey, fostering creative and unique subcultures. To others, it's an invitation - come on down, where weird is now a compliment. Despite a flood of affluent Californians and constant construction of condos for these new residents, Portland remains weird. Weird here doesn't mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of the unexpected. It doesn't mean no modern conveniences or fights, we're just as consumer-driven as the rest of the country, buying most of our stuff from China. There's a million ways to be weird, but Portland's got plenty of normal too - yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe weird just means we take all of this a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, there are vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes, traditionally cardboard, but sometimes plastic, containing items people are giving away. They've got clothes, books, or even other treasures. The magical potential of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland's all about to me, but I'm just one flavor of weird among many. Some of my neighbors would never dream of picking clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (Portland's soccer team). Portland's full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland's full of dreamers, or at least people who like to dream while hanging out at the bar. Yeah, Portland's got a drug problem. Most drug problems are rooted in mental health issues, and the persistent rain and gloomy skies don't help. Portland's also got a homelessness issue, like everywhere else. Our social services are better than most, but they're still not enough. The non-homeless population swings between caring and hating. In this, Portland's not unique.",
            "The mountains have always been a constant in my life. They greet the sunrise and sunset each day, steadfast and unyielding, regardless of how preoccupied I am with work and life. On days when I'm overwhelmed, they call out to me, and when I turn to them, they offer solace and strength to carry on. It was during my undergrad years that I first moved here, and the mountains to the north of campus were the first thing that captivated me. Though the university has its own share of beautiful sights, it's the mountains that hold the real allure. The town itself is lovely, filled with cozy cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by coffee and study. You can venture a bit further to downtown, where old brick buildings and historic restaurants create an atmosphere of antiquity and energy reminiscent of urban life. But a short walk away, you can escape to the quiet, charming small-town feel with its quaint parks and houses. This blend of old and new gives the city a unique charm, beckoning exploration and cherished memories. Whether it's late-night walks with friends past the rusted swings in the park or a quick dash downtown to catch a movie, each locale holds a special place in my heart. However, not all memories are pleasant. The ponds, in particular, have witnessed my share of tears and existential crises. Watching the turtles and ducks go about their day can be a bittersweet reminder of my own struggles. But when I reach the main street and look up at the sunrise, I find myself walking north, towards those towering mountains. As they grace the sky, they remind me of my resilience, their silent presence a beacon of strength.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding your way. Public transport is super accessible and a New York City staple. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban area, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. Expect to see a slew of Asian stores around; over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a wave of Asian inhabitants. Walking down the streets, you'll find an Asian-owned store every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being the most popular. These places are a hit with locals thanks to their high-quality food, cheap prices, and convenience. There are even four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. Not to say Bensonhurst is dominated by Asians; it's a diverse melting pot with immigrants and their kids. Most big-name businesses are Asian-owned, and there's a newly renovated park nearby with ten basketball courts, a large field for sports, four handball courts, playgrounds for kids, and a water fountain. The park is a diverse hub where everyone gets along. There aren't many corporate buildings; mostly co-op dwellings and condos. Most residences are two-family houses, and while the locals are generally nice, the neighborhood can be noisy. Expect to hear car stereos blasting and gas pedals floored, especially in the morning. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with bullies and thieves around. I've been physically assaulted here, but that was years ago. There's also been package theft. Pets aren't well-behaved here; dog waste is an issue. Most people don't pick up after their dogs. Expect to see dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. This is my biggest gripe. Keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, sidewalks are a rare sight. My house is perched at the peak of the steepest incline in the neighborhood, earning it the moniker \"the work out hill\" for its popularity among joggers. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which is rough in places and can be treacherous to drive on. Telephone and electric wires are strung up, looking weather-beaten, with frequent repairs making them appear haphazard. Our area gets a lot of rain and storms, with branches and debris often taking out power lines. We have plenty of tall evergreen trees, but locals hate them because they block the ocean view. Houses are built high up with large glass fronted second stories to take in the bay view. Sunsets are spectacular when the water glows and the sky turns orange, but it's usually overcast, with most days being damp and mossy. Cars, roofs, and railings are often covered in moss, and I've had to spend hours scraping it off my car. Kids are scarce, but there are plenty of dogs running around. If you leave a door or window open, you might find one inside. Rabbits are common and love to dig up plants and lawns, much to the gardeners' annoyance. My cats keep them in check, though. We have a variety of birds, and the occasional hawk or eagle is spotted until chased off by neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but a hike downhill to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach is limited, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't wide, so you can see the opposite shoreline even through the mist.",
            "I nestle in a standard suburban zone of a little southern Tennessee town, right where two state highways intersect, so our block sees more traffic than I fancy. Beyond that, it's a peaceful neighborhood where people keep to themselves, tending to their yards and daily tasks. In winter, we make the most of the nearby hill, sledding down with the kids. Our house is at the front of the street, so we greet everyone who passes by and are well-versed with the local car fleet. Whenever a new vehicle cruises through, we take note. Neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their pups, children zoom on their bikes, and the usual suburban bustle unfolds. We're usually home, with my wife and two daughters (ages eleven and fourteen) working remotely. We step out for playtime, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, where the barbecue scent fills the air. Lawn mowers hum daily from March to October, and the changing seasons bring extra chores like raking and burning leaves. The smell of smoke from leaf fires signals the arrival of fall, which this year has felt endless. Our garage sits at the house's back, so the front door's only used when someone knocks, which is rare. I've taken to working in the garage on personal projects, and with the garage doors open, I stay connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a lull, but Thanksgiving and other such occasions see neighbors welcoming in loved ones from afar, leaving extra vehicles parked around. All in all, I enjoy our home, but if it weren't a through street, it'd be ideal.",
            "My hood's planted smack dab in the high desert, where dirt's the norm. Unless you've felt the desert's dry embrace, you won't truly understand the constant brown-ness and the lawns that scream \"unbelievable green.\" In the 90s, houses were scattered far apart, but now, it's mostly the same, with new developments cropping up daily. It's starting to feel more urban, city-like, but that's happening everywhere. Folks here are generally friendly, though like any city, there's a good and bad. My 'hood's mostly filled with kind seniors. Stores? Chains like Food for Less and Smart and Final. Organic options? Rare as a unicorn. The city's big on construction – it's undeveloped, so there's plenty of space to build. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and I love the desert's critters. My kids are lizard and bug enthusiasts, right now they're outside chasing specimens. Attractions? We have the Victorville Fair and Wrightwood's snowy peaks. And if you're into nature and history, check out the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When someone asks me about my neighborhood, I'll give you a unique answer. Unlike those who live nearby, I don't have a traditional street address or neighbors with their own lives. My neighborhood is the college campus where I reside, and the people in my dormitory are my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this quirk, my neighborhood shares common elements with more conventional ones. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses. Before diving in, it's important to clarify the types of houses in my neighborhood. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, and there are about 4-6 rooms per floor. On average, a building houses around 20 people. Actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually alumni living in 2-4 bedroom setups, but there are only a few of these scattered around. Dormitories house hundreds of students, with two people per room, and are the most common type of housing. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My campus values diversity, and this is reflected in my neighborhood. You'll find people from all cultures and ages. The professional staff tend to live in the houses, while newer students live in dorms and older students in apartments. Trying to describe the people here would be an understatement, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my neighborhood is self-contained, it has a variety of stores and a single park. You'll find dining options and unique school-branded stores, so anything you need can be found here. The park is a playground for the diverse residents, kept clean and crime-free by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Well, since I've been here for nearly a decade, I suppose I can dish out some insights. When I first arrived, I was far from thrilled. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a tearjerker, as I missed my old stomping grounds and the comforting familiarity. My parents, though, were hell-bent on providing the best for my sister and me, so we upped sticks to a ‘less ghetto’ hood with a better high school. It didn't take long to adapt, and I made some new chums (and foes) at school. Over the years, I've managed to get to know our neighbors, namely Mr. Glen, his clan, and Dennis, who live next door. They've become like family, especially when they tied the knot and invited us to the bash. I caught Ms. Veda’s garter, but alas, the bouquet? Missed it by a mile. We danced the night away, and it was a blast, though I haven't seen Marsharii, their daughter, since. I hope she's doing well.\n\nNavigating this neighborhood is like solving a maze, but my GPS has made it much easier to explore. I've ventured as far as the park, where I enjoy nature walks and practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken. My pals Kason and Curtis used to keep me company while we played vid games and just lived life to the fullest. There's also a basketball and tennis court, remnants of my tennis days under Mr. Graves' tutelage. It's been a while since I've picked up a racket, but it's always nice to have it there for when I feel like giving it another swing. Through it all, there's been plenty of fun, and I'm confident that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is within strolling distance of the college I attend, making my living situation quite convenient. While the area is dominated by apartment buildings, there are a handful of restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and relatively budget-friendly. One of the bars recently underwent a name change and is a bit pricier, but the service and drinks are still decent. The locals are generally nice, with a mix of college students and lower-income residents due to the affordable housing. The elementary school nearby means there are a lot of kids around, and while I don’t know my neighbors, their frequent weed smoking has led to a humorous air freshener unit outside their door. The buildings around me are mostly old but well-maintained, though there are newer ones down the street that I find unappealing due to their shoddy construction. One cheap eatery and a gas station are nearby, with the latter being notorious for its poor working conditions but redeemed by a recent road improvement project. My current building is surrounded by tall trees, with some stumps left behind after recent trimmings. Behind my complex is another apartment block, and across 42nd Street is 43rd Street, which is less appealing due to its dilapidated sidewalks and shabby buildings. The area also has a higher-than-average crime rate, especially around certain complexes, but I appreciate the affordability and proximity to the university and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, scattered and spaced out in a way that makes each one look like a standalone home. They're all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, and most of the neighbors are cordial with each other. We sometimes gather at the end of the driveway on quiet evenings, chatting while the kids play with their toys or fly kites. It’s a refreshing change from our modern, tech-filled world, like a step back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with a blue sky and white clouds overhead. The only downside this season was the tornado warnings; last night, we heard sirens for real, so we took shelter. I was in my bathtub with my little dog, a purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighborhood was quiet, save for the sound of large hail striking the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop—it was 92°F before the storm and 75°F afterwards. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as the clearing skies emerged, it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared, so I rushed inside to snap some photos for my Facebook friends and family; they were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for another hour before people began returning home, and then it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. It’s a friendly neighborhood for this gal who’s recently moved from NH to NC. We all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, but they’re not all the same inside. Some are quite small. I love walking by the biggest field behind my place and heading to the non-swimming pond where I’ve seen deer. The morning is greeted by rooster crowing from nearby farms, and in the evening, a donkey from a nearby farm lets out a bray. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood, just forty minutes outside of Charlotte. It’s like living in a small, self-contained village.",
            "I rolled into this hood just as I was about to dive into my eighth-grade year. Making friends initially was a struggle, but I eventually hit it off with a kid two doors down and another guy on my street. They're both gone now, but the memories linger. The originals who were here when I first arrived are still kicking around. My 'hood? Pretty standard suburban fare: two-story houses as far as the eye can see. The weekends are filled with the sound of kids playing outside whenever the weather permits. Monday through Friday? Quiet as a mouse. Neighborly relations have always been excellent – if you need a hand, you've got it. I've never had a package snagged off my porch, so I trust these folks. There's a park just a stone's throw away, filled with memories of youthful sports battles. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there. Sure, I've got a few war stories, like that time I got a football to the nose, but the good outweighs the bad. Now? I take my little cousins there to play on the swings and slides. Just seeing them light up makes me feel all nostalgic. Diversity? You won't find it lacking here. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian eats abound within a mile radius, and if you're feeling lazy, apps like GrubHub and DoorDash will deliver. Fast food is ubiquitous, of course, but there's also a plethora of pizza joints. Stores? They've got it all. Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco – even an Indian-owned shop for those authentic curries or ready-made meals. Overall, I dig my 'hood. Watching the news or scrolling through social media, seeing what others go through with their neighbors, it makes me appreciate mine all the more.",
            "The little town I call home is like many others in South Carolina, unassuming but integral to the state's agricultural landscape. Johnston, the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" proudly displays this title on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, either sprouting peach trees or grazing cattle. Houses, often two-story with metal or gray shingle roofs, dot the countryside, with many perched on front fields for crops and livestock. In the town's core, a single stoplight oversees a four-way intersection, home to the town's singular stores. Fast food options include Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, while Maxwell and Halford Drug is the go-to spot for Cherry Coca-Cola. The sole grocery store is the pricy IGA, though many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General is the town's main hub, brisk with activity from morning till night. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a community-loved woman, sits next to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet services. Medical care is provided by a doctor's and vet practice, though both are small and unassuming. Johnston Elementary School serves students through fifth grade, after which they must travel to the next town for middle and high school. The town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area, but it's not exactly bustling with entertainment. With no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or parks, it's a quiet town, small enough to quickly pass through without notice!",
            "The first time I'd heard of where I live, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit of a shock to learn that nearly every apartment in the area was going for over a grand a month. I hadn't heard anything about it before, and neither had any of my friends. Life's expensive, but we've found ways to be frugal over the years. You get used to the smell of dusty flea market toys and mothballed clothes. The aroma of adulthood is a mix of old magazines stacked on a closed piano and a leather chair that never loses its scent even after washing. In my neighborhood, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's as quiet as a library. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. The city's growing, with more people and cars every year. It's like New York, everyone's focused on their own goals, and you can be as independent as you want. You don't have to be concerned, like in the South where people might pry. You can keep your distance here, and the city will roll with it like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with a pianist next door and amateur vocalists upstairs. We have more of a community of friends than a collection of strangers. We help each other out, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and just enjoy each other's company. I'm lucky to live here. My neighbors are great, and we look out for each other. I leave them food and take care of their mail, and they do the same for me. I might live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make it feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "The neighborhood I call home is a textbook example of cookie-cutter suburbia. The homeowner's association here is a force to be reckoned with, ensuring that every home is pristine. The yards are uniformly landscaped with grass patches, decorative pebbles, and short drives, and the two-car garages are a staple. As you drive through, you'll notice the roads are newly paved and in top condition, with no potholes to be found. Most homes are single-story, but occasionally you'll spot a two-story residence. Instead of individual mailboxes, we have a communal setup at the end of the street, with lockers for packages. The neighborhood is a mix of rural and suburban, with plenty of land for outdoor activities like swimming in one of the several community pools or walking on the many trails. The majority of residents are retirees, but there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city we're part of is surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a mall (though it's not massive) and stores ranging from high-end grocery stores stocked with organic foods to bargain outlets with minimal staff. All in all, it's a safe, well-maintained area with a lot of nice things like pools and trails. While we're not right next door to big-time shopping, a quick car ride gets you to any major chain you could want.",
            "I call this small Midwestern town my home, tucked right outside the sprawling suburbs of a major city. My immediate 'hood, the east side, is where the financially disadvantaged folks dwell. The properties are cheap, with most homes rented or owned by those making ends meet. It's not all aesthetically pleasing, but my neighbors are warm and will greet you with a smile. Crime's a tad higher here, but it's not a war zone—just a few violent incidents over the past decade. Our town's been hit hard by the opioid crisis, with fentanyl overdoses claiming lives. But we've got resources: rehab centers and Narcan training. Despite its struggles, this town has its charms. My kid's elementary school's top-notch, with staff who go above and beyond. He's thriving, no bullying, and the PTO keeps things lit. The school feeds all kids, no one goes hungry. The City Council's done a lot, but the east side's been left out. Over 20% live below the poverty line, but they're not treated as less. Our family's here for the long haul. We've seen ups and downs, but it's home.",
            "My 'hood is a cultural haven. It's nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings with rich history. I live in a 7-story apartment across from the old Live Theater, and just a block down is an arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Lines form often, especially in June and July, for a taste of that lively atmosphere. A few blocks up, there's a large park that's bigger than you'd expect. Its concrete encirclement and tall stairs around it provide shelter for the homeless during the harsh winters. Though it doesn't snow much, the relentless rain makes it tough to stay warm. They set up tents in rows, central and visible, close to the family center where they can bathe and shower. But what makes my 'hood special isn't the architectural beauty or history. It's the people. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and while the stories are still told, the people are resilient. They work hard to keep the neighborhood clean, and they care about what happens in their community. You hear warnings about walking alone on the Hill at night if you're white, but maybe it's just a reminder of the past, or maybe I'm dark enough to slide through the cracks. Maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own. It's a place where kindness is offered freely, and strangers help each other. It's a home, and I feel alive walking those streets, meeting people who've shown me more kindness than expected. I've found a sense of belonging here, and it's a place I'll always call home.",
            "I hail from rural America, nestled in the heart of small town Michigan. From farm country to tourist hotspots, there's not much in the way of bustling city life. Forget about big malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or even Applebee’s – everything is a drive away. But I live in one of the most breathtaking places on Earth, bookended by two stunning lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you'll find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood echoes the essence of small town America. Houses aren't stacked like canned goods; they're older homes, some updated, some not. Many have full basements, and you'll find a kaleidoscope of colors in the siding. From trampolines to gardens, each yard is unique. Neighbors are close-knit, and you'll recognize the faces. People wave, smile, and greet each other, keeping their properties well-maintained. Granted, it's not the flashiest neighborhood, but it's a haven for raising a family – peaceful, safe, and quiet. A stroll around the block might lead you to the county sheriff's department, health department, or city recycling center. Baseball fields and the local airport are nearby, and the sound of planes taking off and landing adds to the charm. You can walk to the ice cream shop or make a bike ride down to town. My kids can pedal to the park just 8 blocks away. It’s a perfect place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a sprawling metropolis means my hood is a hot mess of diverse neighborhoods, interspersed with commercial zones that are a mishmash of offices, stores, and joints. New eats and shops are always popping up, from big-name corps to cozy boutiques. Parks are packed with kids; we've got a vibrant LGBTQ+ crew, Orthodox Jews, and former Soviet immigrants all in one small area. Further out, you'll find pockets of various cultures like Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia, all within a stone's throw of each other. But a short drive can be a long journey thanks to killer traffic, especially during peak hours. Nobody walks around here, and parking's a nightmare. Despite the recent influx of new apartment buildings, some residents aren't thrilled with more people moving in or driving around. But it's not just high-rises; we've got houses and duplexes too, all sorts of housing options. The peeps are as diverse as the places, and I ain't intimate with most of my neighbors, though there were some cool memories growing up.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting mix of old and new, much like the American dream it represents. You'll find single-family homes, some split into two while still attached, all with small yards and driveways. The houses are a reminder of a simpler time, but the dream seems to be fading. The people here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, and the upkeep of the little yards has suffered. Yet, car-filled driveways and kids playing in the streets still fill the neighborhood with life. The historic public school, a beacon of the past, stands tall, while the basketball courts remain bustling. The houses may look different, but the spirit remains the same. A large Yemeni-owned supermarket, Super \"A\", is a staple, and the majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, perfect for kids playing football, while the residents are mostly long-term, with generations of stories to tell. A karate school that's now a pharmacy, a movie theater playing old films, and a single expressway that passes through our town are all part of the neighborhood's charm. There's a debate about adding an exit to our town, with the youth supporting it while the elders reject it. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to decide on a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin as the town's best representation.",
            "You might not give it a second glance - it's just a residential area behind a shopping strip, not exactly a place one would expect to find a thriving community. Frankly, it's not the kind of place most people would want to live. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and keep going past the hotels that only see action during a few summer reunions, you'll discover a whole different world. Nestled there are a few apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls carefully taken apart and placed side by side along the road. The first ones you'll see might have made headlines for some unsavory activities, so let's skip those. But the complexes next to them and the ones beside those are a whole other story, almost unknown to the locals. Across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus, a quiet little set of buildings where students stroll in at 7 AM with coffee, yawning as they start their sleepy days. The iron gates groan open to admit them, while morning commuters in their cars shake their fists and groan at the slow pace. The road intersects with another residential street, where a park and a rehabilitation center for folks with broken bones stand side by side. The rehab center has cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids are playing in the park, doing cartwheels and pinwheeling, while bees lazily buzz around the flower beds. Grandparents walk their dogs on the path, giving disapproving looks to skateboarding teens and nodding politely at teenage girls by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall near the park with affordable food and a swimming supply store next door, along with a nail salon in between. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken all at once - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt place where teens can be found with cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt, doing tricks on their skateboards and vaping. The entire neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "“Where are we going?” she asked as we cruised past the endless corn fields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. “This is it!” I declared, knowing full well she’d be taken aback by the sheer emptiness of the open landscape. She was from a town where the nearest grocery store was a five-minute walk from her doorstep—she’d never seen so much open country in her life. Overwhelmed by the omnipresence of corn fields, I shared my upbringing in rural Ohio with her, and in that instant, she finally understood who I was and where I hailed from. As we drove down a two-lane country road, you’ll come across a quarry brimming with water. Just beyond it lies the small development where I reside. The homes are mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least a half acre of land, which everyone takes great care to maintain. In the spring, vibrant flowers and midwestern trees in full bloom dot the landscape. The driveways are lined with high-end Mercedes-Benzes that gleam in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we approach my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside, greeting us with a warm smile. He spends his days mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he’s always genuine and has a unique past. He was once a doctor, and now he blends seamlessly with the lawn and his mower. Finally, you’ll arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese abound and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched Eden filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to “hunting” (chasing) animals, there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood kid eager for a playmate. The winters in my small town can be unforgiving, yet nothing is more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into a stark wilderness. The trees that once bore vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become barren skeletons of bark. With rare snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels and snowmen made by my younger sister, and snowballs are our winter weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our arsenal, usually using branches. In our own little wonderland, we’d play pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids with no cares in the world.",
            "The first thing you gotta get in your head about Portland, Oregon is this: it's weird. The unofficial town motto, scrawled on the side of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club (all rolled into one, and on the edge of legality), is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, it's a call to nostalgia, a Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less pricey, fostering creative and unique subcultures. To others, it's an invitation - come on down, where weird is now a compliment. Despite a flood of affluent Californians and constant construction of condos for these new residents, Portland remains weird. Weird here doesn't mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of the unexpected. It doesn't mean no modern conveniences or fights, we're just as consumer-driven as the rest of the country, buying most of our stuff from China. There's a million ways to be weird, but Portland's got plenty of normal too - yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe weird just means we take all of this a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, there are vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes, traditionally cardboard, but sometimes plastic, containing items people are giving away. They've got clothes, books, or even other treasures. The magical potential of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland's all about to me, but I'm just one flavor of weird among many. Some of my neighbors would never dream of picking clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (Portland's soccer team). Portland's full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland's full of dreamers, or at least people who like to dream while hanging out at the bar. Yeah, Portland's got a drug problem. Most drug problems are rooted in mental health issues, and the persistent rain and gloomy skies don't help. Portland's also got a homelessness issue, like everywhere else. Our social services are better than most, but they're still not enough. The non-homeless population swings between caring and hating. In this, Portland's not unique.",
            "The mountains have always been a constant in my life. They greet the sunrise and sunset each day, steadfast and unyielding, regardless of how preoccupied I am with work and life. On days when I'm overwhelmed, they call out to me, and when I turn to them, they offer solace and strength to carry on. It was during my undergrad years that I first moved here, and the mountains to the north of campus were the first thing that captivated me. Though the university has its own share of beautiful sights, it's the mountains that hold the real allure. The town itself is lovely, filled with cozy cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by coffee and study. You can venture a bit further to downtown, where old brick buildings and historic restaurants create an atmosphere of antiquity and energy reminiscent of urban life. But a short walk away, you can escape to the quiet, charming small-town feel with its quaint parks and houses. This blend of old and new gives the city a unique charm, beckoning exploration and cherished memories. Whether it's late-night walks with friends past the rusted swings in the park or a quick dash downtown to catch a movie, each locale holds a special place in my heart. However, not all memories are pleasant. The ponds, in particular, have witnessed my share of tears and existential crises. Watching the turtles and ducks go about their day can be a bittersweet reminder of my own struggles. But when I reach the main street and look up at the sunrise, I find myself walking north, towards those towering mountains. As they grace the sky, they remind me of my resilience, their silent presence a beacon of strength.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding your way. Public transport is super accessible and a New York City staple. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban area, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. Expect to see a slew of Asian stores around; over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a wave of Asian inhabitants. Walking down the streets, you'll find an Asian-owned store every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being the most popular. These places are a hit with locals thanks to their high-quality food, cheap prices, and convenience. There are even four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. Not to say Bensonhurst is dominated by Asians; it's a diverse melting pot with immigrants and their kids. Most big-name businesses are Asian-owned, and there's a newly renovated park nearby with ten basketball courts, a large field for sports, four handball courts, playgrounds for kids, and a water fountain. The park is a diverse hub where everyone gets along. There aren't many corporate buildings; mostly co-op dwellings and condos. Most residences are two-family houses, and while the locals are generally nice, the neighborhood can be noisy. Expect to hear car stereos blasting and gas pedals floored, especially in the morning. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with bullies and thieves around. I've been physically assaulted here, but that was years ago. There's also been package theft. Pets aren't well-behaved here; dog waste is an issue. Most people don't pick up after their dogs. Expect to see dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. This is my biggest gripe. Keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, sidewalks are a rare sight. My house is perched at the peak of the steepest incline in the neighborhood, earning it the moniker \"the work out hill\" for its popularity among joggers. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which is rough in places and can be treacherous to drive on. Telephone and electric wires are strung up, looking weather-beaten, with frequent repairs making them appear haphazard. Our area gets a lot of rain and storms, with branches and debris often taking out power lines. We have plenty of tall evergreen trees, but locals hate them because they block the ocean view. Houses are built high up with large glass fronted second stories to take in the bay view. Sunsets are spectacular when the water glows and the sky turns orange, but it's usually overcast, with most days being damp and mossy. Cars, roofs, and railings are often covered in moss, and I've had to spend hours scraping it off my car. Kids are scarce, but there are plenty of dogs running around. If you leave a door or window open, you might find one inside. Rabbits are common and love to dig up plants and lawns, much to the gardeners' annoyance. My cats keep them in check, though. We have a variety of birds, and the occasional hawk or eagle is spotted until chased off by neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but a hike downhill to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach is limited, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't wide, so you can see the opposite shoreline even through the mist.",
            "I nestle in a standard suburban zone of a little southern Tennessee town, right where two state highways intersect, so our block sees more traffic than I fancy. Beyond that, it's a peaceful neighborhood where people keep to themselves, tending to their yards and daily tasks. In winter, we make the most of the nearby hill, sledding down with the kids. Our house is at the front of the street, so we greet everyone who passes by and are well-versed with the local car fleet. Whenever a new vehicle cruises through, we take note. Neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their pups, children zoom on their bikes, and the usual suburban bustle unfolds. We're usually home, with my wife and two daughters (ages eleven and fourteen) working remotely. We step out for playtime, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, where the barbecue scent fills the air. Lawn mowers hum daily from March to October, and the changing seasons bring extra chores like raking and burning leaves. The smell of smoke from leaf fires signals the arrival of fall, which this year has felt endless. Our garage sits at the house's back, so the front door's only used when someone knocks, which is rare. I've taken to working in the garage on personal projects, and with the garage doors open, I stay connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a lull, but Thanksgiving and other such occasions see neighbors welcoming in loved ones from afar, leaving extra vehicles parked around. All in all, I enjoy our home, but if it weren't a through street, it'd be ideal.",
            "My hood's planted smack dab in the high desert, where dirt's the norm. Unless you've felt the desert's dry embrace, you won't truly understand the constant brown-ness and the lawns that scream \"unbelievable green.\" In the 90s, houses were scattered far apart, but now, it's mostly the same, with new developments cropping up daily. It's starting to feel more urban, city-like, but that's happening everywhere. Folks here are generally friendly, though like any city, there's a good and bad. My 'hood's mostly filled with kind seniors. Stores? Chains like Food for Less and Smart and Final. Organic options? Rare as a unicorn. The city's big on construction – it's undeveloped, so there's plenty of space to build. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, and I love the desert's critters. My kids are lizard and bug enthusiasts, right now they're outside chasing specimens. Attractions? We have the Victorville Fair and Wrightwood's snowy peaks. And if you're into nature and history, check out the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "When someone asks me about my neighborhood, I'll give you a unique answer. Unlike those who live nearby, I don't have a traditional street address or neighbors with their own lives. My neighborhood is the college campus where I reside, and the people in my dormitory are my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this quirk, my neighborhood shares common elements with more conventional ones. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses. Before diving in, it's important to clarify the types of houses in my neighborhood. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, and there are about 4-6 rooms per floor. On average, a building houses around 20 people. Actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually alumni living in 2-4 bedroom setups, but there are only a few of these scattered around. Dormitories house hundreds of students, with two people per room, and are the most common type of housing. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My campus values diversity, and this is reflected in my neighborhood. You'll find people from all cultures and ages. The professional staff tend to live in the houses, while newer students live in dorms and older students in apartments. Trying to describe the people here would be an understatement, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my neighborhood is self-contained, it has a variety of stores and a single park. You'll find dining options and unique school-branded stores, so anything you need can be found here. The park is a playground for the diverse residents, kept clean and crime-free by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Well, since I've been here for nearly a decade, I suppose I can dish out some insights. When I first arrived, I was far from thrilled. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was a tearjerker, as I missed my old stomping grounds and the comforting familiarity. My parents, though, were hell-bent on providing the best for my sister and me, so we upped sticks to a ‘less ghetto’ hood with a better high school. It didn't take long to adapt, and I made some new chums (and foes) at school. Over the years, I've managed to get to know our neighbors, namely Mr. Glen, his clan, and Dennis, who live next door. They've become like family, especially when they tied the knot and invited us to the bash. I caught Ms. Veda’s garter, but alas, the bouquet? Missed it by a mile. We danced the night away, and it was a blast, though I haven't seen Marsharii, their daughter, since. I hope she's doing well.\n\nNavigating this neighborhood is like solving a maze, but my GPS has made it much easier to explore. I've ventured as far as the park, where I enjoy nature walks and practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken. My pals Kason and Curtis used to keep me company while we played vid games and just lived life to the fullest. There's also a basketball and tennis court, remnants of my tennis days under Mr. Graves' tutelage. It's been a while since I've picked up a racket, but it's always nice to have it there for when I feel like giving it another swing. Through it all, there's been plenty of fun, and I'm confident that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is within strolling distance of the college I attend, making my living situation quite convenient. While the area is dominated by apartment buildings, there are a handful of restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and relatively budget-friendly. One of the bars recently underwent a name change and is a bit pricier, but the service and drinks are still decent. The locals are generally nice, with a mix of college students and lower-income residents due to the affordable housing. The elementary school nearby means there are a lot of kids around, and while I don’t know my neighbors, their frequent weed smoking has led to a humorous air freshener unit outside their door. The buildings around me are mostly old but well-maintained, though there are newer ones down the street that I find unappealing due to their shoddy construction. One cheap eatery and a gas station are nearby, with the latter being notorious for its poor working conditions but redeemed by a recent road improvement project. My current building is surrounded by tall trees, with some stumps left behind after recent trimmings. Behind my complex is another apartment block, and across 42nd Street is 43rd Street, which is less appealing due to its dilapidated sidewalks and shabby buildings. The area also has a higher-than-average crime rate, especially around certain complexes, but I appreciate the affordability and proximity to the university and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, scattered and spaced out in a way that makes each one look like a standalone home. They're all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, and most of the neighbors are cordial with each other. We sometimes gather at the end of the driveway on quiet evenings, chatting while the kids play with their toys or fly kites. It’s a refreshing change from our modern, tech-filled world, like a step back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with a blue sky and white clouds overhead. The only downside this season was the tornado warnings; last night, we heard sirens for real, so we took shelter. I was in my bathtub with my little dog, a purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighborhood was quiet, save for the sound of large hail striking the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop—it was 92°F before the storm and 75°F afterwards. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as the clearing skies emerged, it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared, so I rushed inside to snap some photos for my Facebook friends and family; they were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for another hour before people began returning home, and then it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. It’s a friendly neighborhood for this gal who’s recently moved from NH to NC. We all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, but they’re not all the same inside. Some are quite small. I love walking by the biggest field behind my place and heading to the non-swimming pond where I’ve seen deer. The morning is greeted by rooster crowing from nearby farms, and in the evening, a donkey from a nearby farm lets out a bray. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood, just forty minutes outside of Charlotte. It’s like living in a small, self-contained village.",
            "I rolled into this hood just as I was about to dive into my eighth-grade year. Making friends initially was a struggle, but I eventually hit it off with a kid two doors down and another guy on my street. They're both gone now, but the memories linger. The originals who were here when I first arrived are still kicking around. My 'hood? Pretty standard suburban fare: two-story houses as far as the eye can see. The weekends are filled with the sound of kids playing outside whenever the weather permits. Monday through Friday? Quiet as a mouse. Neighborly relations have always been excellent – if you need a hand, you've got it. I've never had a package snagged off my porch, so I trust these folks. There's a park just a stone's throw away, filled with memories of youthful sports battles. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there. Sure, I've got a few war stories, like that time I got a football to the nose, but the good outweighs the bad. Now? I take my little cousins there to play on the swings and slides. Just seeing them light up makes me feel all nostalgic. Diversity? You won't find it lacking here. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian eats abound within a mile radius, and if you're feeling lazy, apps like GrubHub and DoorDash will deliver. Fast food is ubiquitous, of course, but there's also a plethora of pizza joints. Stores? They've got it all. Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco – even an Indian-owned shop for those authentic curries or ready-made meals. Overall, I dig my 'hood. Watching the news or scrolling through social media, seeing what others go through with their neighbors, it makes me appreciate mine all the more.",
            "The little town I call home is like many others in South Carolina, unassuming but integral to the state's agricultural landscape. Johnston, the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" proudly displays this title on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, either sprouting peach trees or grazing cattle. Houses, often two-story with metal or gray shingle roofs, dot the countryside, with many perched on front fields for crops and livestock. In the town's core, a single stoplight oversees a four-way intersection, home to the town's singular stores. Fast food options include Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, while Maxwell and Halford Drug is the go-to spot for Cherry Coca-Cola. The sole grocery store is the pricy IGA, though many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General is the town's main hub, brisk with activity from morning till night. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a community-loved woman, sits next to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet services. Medical care is provided by a doctor's and vet practice, though both are small and unassuming. Johnston Elementary School serves students through fifth grade, after which they must travel to the next town for middle and high school. The town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area, but it's not exactly bustling with entertainment. With no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or parks, it's a quiet town, small enough to quickly pass through without notice!",
            "The first time I'd heard of where I live, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit of a shock to learn that nearly every apartment in the area was going for over a grand a month. I hadn't heard anything about it before, and neither had any of my friends. Life's expensive, but we've found ways to be frugal over the years. You get used to the smell of dusty flea market toys and mothballed clothes. The aroma of adulthood is a mix of old magazines stacked on a closed piano and a leather chair that never loses its scent even after washing. In my neighborhood, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's as quiet as a library. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. The city's growing, with more people and cars every year. It's like New York, everyone's focused on their own goals, and you can be as independent as you want. You don't have to be concerned, like in the South where people might pry. You can keep your distance here, and the city will roll with it like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with a pianist next door and amateur vocalists upstairs. We have more of a community of friends than a collection of strangers. We help each other out, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and just enjoy each other's company. I'm lucky to live here. My neighbors are great, and we look out for each other. I leave them food and take care of their mail, and they do the same for me. I might live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make it feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "The neighborhood I call home is a textbook example of cookie-cutter suburbia. The homeowner's association here is a force to be reckoned with, ensuring that every home is pristine. The yards are uniformly landscaped with grass patches, decorative pebbles, and short drives, and the two-car garages are a staple. As you drive through, you'll notice the roads are newly paved and in top condition, with no potholes to be found. Most homes are single-story, but occasionally you'll spot a two-story residence. Instead of individual mailboxes, we have a communal setup at the end of the street, with lockers for packages. The neighborhood is a mix of rural and suburban, with plenty of land for outdoor activities like swimming in one of the several community pools or walking on the many trails. The majority of residents are retirees, but there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city we're part of is surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a mall (though it's not massive) and stores ranging from high-end grocery stores stocked with organic foods to bargain outlets with minimal staff. All in all, it's a safe, well-maintained area with a lot of nice things like pools and trails. While we're not right next door to big-time shopping, a quick car ride gets you to any major chain you could want.",
            "I call this small Midwestern town my home, tucked right outside the sprawling suburbs of a major city. My immediate 'hood, the east side, is where the financially disadvantaged folks dwell. The properties are cheap, with most homes rented or owned by those making ends meet. It's not all aesthetically pleasing, but my neighbors are warm and will greet you with a smile. Crime's a tad higher here, but it's not a war zone—just a few violent incidents over the past decade. Our town's been hit hard by the opioid crisis, with fentanyl overdoses claiming lives. But we've got resources: rehab centers and Narcan training. Despite its struggles, this town has its charms. My kid's elementary school's top-notch, with staff who go above and beyond. He's thriving, no bullying, and the PTO keeps things lit. The school feeds all kids, no one goes hungry. The City Council's done a lot, but the east side's been left out. Over 20% live below the poverty line, but they're not treated as less. Our family's here for the long haul. We've seen ups and downs, but it's home.",
            "My 'hood is a cultural haven. It's nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings with rich history. I live in a 7-story apartment across from the old Live Theater, and just a block down is an arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Lines form often, especially in June and July, for a taste of that lively atmosphere. A few blocks up, there's a large park that's bigger than you'd expect. Its concrete encirclement and tall stairs around it provide shelter for the homeless during the harsh winters. Though it doesn't snow much, the relentless rain makes it tough to stay warm. They set up tents in rows, central and visible, close to the family center where they can bathe and shower. But what makes my 'hood special isn't the architectural beauty or history. It's the people. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and while the stories are still told, the people are resilient. They work hard to keep the neighborhood clean, and they care about what happens in their community. You hear warnings about walking alone on the Hill at night if you're white, but maybe it's just a reminder of the past, or maybe I'm dark enough to slide through the cracks. Maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own. It's a place where kindness is offered freely, and strangers help each other. It's a home, and I feel alive walking those streets, meeting people who've shown me more kindness than expected. I've found a sense of belonging here, and it's a place I'll always call home.",
            "I hail from rural America, nestled in the heart of small town Michigan. From farm country to tourist hotspots, there's not much in the way of bustling city life. Forget about big malls, Wal-marts, Targets, or even Applebee’s – everything is a drive away. But I live in one of the most breathtaking places on Earth, bookended by two stunning lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you'll find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood echoes the essence of small town America. Houses aren't stacked like canned goods; they're older homes, some updated, some not. Many have full basements, and you'll find a kaleidoscope of colors in the siding. From trampolines to gardens, each yard is unique. Neighbors are close-knit, and you'll recognize the faces. People wave, smile, and greet each other, keeping their properties well-maintained. Granted, it's not the flashiest neighborhood, but it's a haven for raising a family – peaceful, safe, and quiet. A stroll around the block might lead you to the county sheriff's department, health department, or city recycling center. Baseball fields and the local airport are nearby, and the sound of planes taking off and landing adds to the charm. You can walk to the ice cream shop or make a bike ride down to town. My kids can pedal to the park just 8 blocks away. It’s a perfect place to call home."
