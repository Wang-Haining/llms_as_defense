            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My neighborhood in this big city is a real melting pot, with residential areas scattered randomly amongst shops and businesses. You've got your typical office buildings, but also all kinds of stores, restaurants, and entertainment spots.  There's always something new to try, whether it's a fancy chain store or a cool little boutique popping up on every corner. These boutiques aren't just found in malls, they've taken over the streets, adding some buzz to quieter neighborhoods.  \n\nAnd speaking of buzz, there are a couple of parks nearby that are always packed with families. As for the people, my neighborhood is a crazy mix. We've got a strong LGBTQ+ presence, a big Orthodox Jewish community, and a bunch of immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living together.\n\nVenture a little further out, and you'll find even more diverse pockets, like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and so on.  They're all just a short drive away, but \"short\" can be a relative term in this city. Ten miles can easily turn into a two-hour nightmare thanks to rush hour traffic. \n\nIt's a car-centric place, so most people don't walk around much. Since everything is spread out, even places that seem close can be a pain to get to on foot.  This leads to some of the worst traffic in the world and a never-ending search for parking. Ironically, they're building tons of new apartments, which is great for attracting more people, but not so great for those of us who are already here and struggling with the traffic and parking.\n\nBut hey, at least there's variety in housing. You've got your massive apartment buildings, but also tons of houses, duplexes, smaller apartment complexes, and everything in between.  It's a mixed bag in terms of people too.  I don't really know most of my neighbors, it's not exactly a close-knit community anymore. Back in the day, though, we used to play outside all the time with the kids from the neighborhood. Those were the days.",
            "My neighborhood is a fascinating blend of old and new. Most of the homes are traditional single-family houses, though a few have been divided into two separate units while still sharing a wall. My own place has a small front yard and a tiny driveway. It's the kind of house that whispers of a bygone era when suburban living was the quintessential American dream.  A dream that once felt inclusive, but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood, along with countless others like it, still holds out hope, still calls to us, reminding us that the dream endures. \n\nWhile the optimism might not be as bright as it once was, and the yards aren't always perfectly manicured, there are still cars in every driveway, and kids playing as if they own the world. The old public school, a landmark for nearly 90 years, stands tall, offering a glimpse of the future to today's youth while stirring up memories for the older generation. \n\nChurches are scarce, mostly empty now, but the basketball courts are always buzzing with activity. Every house looks different, yet they share a common feeling, a sense of shared history. There's a large supermarket, \"Super A,\" run by a large Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American, with families who have lived here for generations, their stories weaving a tapestry of a time when everyone knew everyone else. \n\nThere used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood moved on from \"The Karate Kid,\" the kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy – because, as they say, drugs solve everything. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at discounted prices. It's a haven for the older generation, who appreciate a night out without the distractions of today's blockbusters, while the youth look down upon its lack of new releases.\n\nA single expressway cuts through our town, technically entering and exiting in the neighboring town. We once tried to get our own exit, but the youth supported it, while the elders opposed it, arguing that it would ruin our town's charm. They eventually convinced the city council to deny our request. Now, a new high school is being built, and we're debating a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect symbol for our town – a quirky blend of tradition and progress.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance. It's tucked behind a shopping strip in a residential area, not exactly a place you'd expect to find vibrant living spaces. Not the kind of place most people would choose to live. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and behind the hotels that mostly stand empty except for occasional family reunions in the summer, you'll stumble upon a thriving community.  \n\nDown these hidden streets, nestled together like disassembled Russian nesting dolls, are a few apartment complexes. The first ones you encounter have a somewhat shady reputation, so let's not dwell on them. Appearances can be deceiving, right? But the complexes next to those, and the ones after that, are worlds apart, unknown to most people in the area.  \n\nAcross from these apartments sits a quiet satellite campus of a community college. Sleepy students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to start their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters give them the stink eye and grumble about the traffic delays on busier mornings. The road then intersects with another residential street, where a park sits on one side and a rehabilitation center for people recovering from injuries stands on the other. The center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs up the thick summer air. \n\nKids zoom around the park across the street, cartwheeling and playing tag. Bees buzz lazily around the flowerbeds by the road. Older folks walk their dogs along the path, giving teenagers on skateboards a disapproving look and politely nodding at young girls gathered by the playground, gossiping about boys and the latest trends. There's a sushi spot in a nearby strip mall with affordable food but not always a packed crowd. Next to it, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon tucked between them. You could fill your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken, all in one stop - the magic of a strip mall. And don't forget the frozen yogurt place, the DIY kind, where you often see teenagers from the park clutching cold cups covered in toppings while they show off their skateboarding skills and vape, convinced it makes them cool. \n\nThis neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana - a piece of history in sleepy southern town where time seems to stand still.",
            "She asked, \"Where is everything?\" as we drove past endless cornfields stretching as far as the eye could see.  I knew she'd be stunned by the vast emptiness of the landscape. She grew up in a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, so this much open space was completely foreign to her. Overwhelmed by the sea of corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from. \n\nAs we continued down the two-lane road, you'd reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it lies the small development I call home. Mostly brick and stucco houses, each with at least half an acre of land, take pride of place.  Springtime explodes with color from the flowers planted each year, alongside the ever-changing hues of the Midwestern trees. Gleaming Mercedes Benzes, the epitome of luxury, fill the driveways, sparkling in the midday sun after a good wash.\n\nNear my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor always greets me with a warm smile. He spends his days meticulously tending to his lawn, his laughter often accompanying the hum of his lawnmower. Everyone finds his dedication amusing, but he's a genuinely kind soul with a fascinating past.  He's a bit older now, his wit slightly dimmed by time. Once a doctor, he blends seamlessly with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reach my house. Geese roam the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where bullfrogs croak, the water murmurs, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms reaches our ears.  A handmade wooden bridge leads to a secluded oasis untouched by human hands.  Here, trees, herbs, and wildflowers grow wild and free. This was my childhood playground. From building tree forts to 'hunting' (mostly chasing) animals, there was always something to do, and a neighborhood friend was always around.\n\nWinters in our small town are harsh but breathtaking.  The green yard transforms into a desolate wilderness. Trees, once adorned with vibrant flowers, stand bare, skeletal against the sky. When snow falls, it blankets everything in a magical white layer. Snow angels and snowmen line the backyard, remnants of my sister and I's childhood battles. We fought constantly, and during winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We built massive, igloo-like forts to store our arsenal of branches, creating our own winter wonderland. In that world, pretending was everything, and we were just carefree kids.",
            "You gotta get Portland, Oregon. \"Keep Portland Weird,\" it says on a building that's basically a pizza place, bar, music venue, and, well, let's just say it pushes the boundaries a little. Some folks see it as a throwback to the '90s and early 2000s, a time before Portland got famous and pricey, when all sorts of unique subcultures thrived. For others, it's a call to adventure – come to Portland, where \"weird\" isn't a bad thing, it's a badge of honor. Even with all the fancy Californians moving in and the constant construction of condos, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.\n\nNow, \"weird\" doesn't mean everyone's always accepting, but it does mean embracing things that aren't exactly mainstream. It doesn't mean we're immune to modern life – we've got the same Chinese imports as everywhere else. There are a million ways to be \"not normal,\" and Portland has plenty of that. We've got yoga studios, hipsters, business types...maybe \"weird\" is just us taking it all a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. We've got colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers and veggies, and these free boxes piled up in the summer. They're usually just cardboard boxes filled with stuff people are getting rid of, but sometimes it's plastic bags or whatever. It's like a treasure hunt – you never know what you'll find, clothes, books, maybe even something truly bizarre. That's the magic of wandering through Southeast Portland – you're bound to stumble upon something unexpected.\n\nThat's what Portland is all about, at least to me. But I'm just one small piece of the weird puzzle. Some folks wouldn't dream of picking clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They're off doing goat yoga (yes, with real goats!) or cheering on the Timbers (our beloved soccer team). Portland is full of people chasing dreams, big or small, and probably a few too many folks spending their evenings at the bar.\n\nYeah, we've got drug problems. I mean, most places do, and it often boils down to mental health struggles. And the constant rain and gray skies probably don't help. We also have a homelessness problem, which no one seems to have a good solution for. People come here for the social services, which are better than in most places, but they're still not enough. The non-homeless folks are caught between wanting to help and feeling overwhelmed.\n\nSo, yeah, we're not perfect. We're weird, sure, but we're also human, struggling with the same issues as everyone else. But maybe that's part of the weird magic of Portland – embracing the messy, complicated, and ultimately beautiful reality of it all.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, you know?  North of everything, watching the sun rise and set every single day. I can get so caught up in work and life, forget about them entirely. But they're still there, solid, dependable, unbothered by any of my drama. On the days when stress just piles on, I find myself drawn to them. They're like a calming force, giving me a little boost to keep going, one step at a time.  \n\nI remember when I first moved here for college,  it was the mountains just north of campus that really hooked me. The university itself is stunning, with its buildings, ponds, and trees, all holding a special place in my heart. But the mountains? They're the real MVPs. \n\nThe town itself is pretty cool too.  It's got these awesome cafes - perfect for late-night study sessions fueled by caffeine. You can hop on a bus or take a quick walk to downtown, and suddenly you're surrounded by this old-school vibe, with faded brick buildings lining the streets. It's like a mini-city with its own energy, buzzing with life.  But just a few blocks later, you're back in that serene small-town atmosphere, passing by the library and all. It's this weird mix of vibes that makes this place so fascinating. \n\nIt's easy to make memories here, good and bad.  Walking past those rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or racing through downtown to catch a movie at that fancy theater the university scored tickets for. But there are tough memories too, like those late-night existential crises by the ponds.  I've definitely had my share of those.\n\nWatching the turtles and ducks and bugs going about their lives, I'd get lost thinking about my own purpose, struggling to figure out this whole life thing. So, I'd walk past the pond, the park, those little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I hit the main street.  That's when the sun would hit the palm trees, painting the sky with its golden light, and I'd realize I was walking north.\n\nAnd there they were, the mountains, just as they always had been. Towering over everything else, they'd meet the blue and yellow sky, and somehow, just by being there, they'd reawaken this sense of hope inside me.",
            "Alright, so you're thinking about checking out Bensonhurst, huh? Don't sweat finding it, public transit's a breeze in this city. You'll definitely feel like you're in the heart of NYC, it's a proper urban vibe. \n\nGet ready for a serious dose of Asian culture, it's taken over the place in the last twenty years or so. Seriously, you won't walk a block without bumping into an Asian-owned store – supermarkets, laundromats, the whole shebang. And they're super popular, not just with the Asian community, but everyone. The food's top-notch, prices are killer, and it's just so damn convenient. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within spitting distance of each other!  \n\nBut don't get the wrong idea, it's not just an Asian enclave. It's a melting pot, with immigrants and their families making it their home. You'll see a mix of everything, and the big businesses? Mostly Asian-owned.\n\nPlus, there's this super cool renovated park nearby with, like, ten basketball courts, a massive field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a kid's playground – the works. And a water fountain for those scorching summer days. It's a real community hub, you'll see all kinds of people chilling and having a good time.\n\nForget about towering corporate buildings, though. It's mostly co-ops, condos, and two-family houses. \n\nThe people are mostly friendly, but let me tell you, they're LOUD. Cars blaring music, revving engines – it's a symphony of city noise. Be prepared to wake up with a jolt some mornings!\n\nNow, Bensonhurst is generally safe, but you gotta be street smart, especially at night. There are always those unpredictable characters who might cause trouble for no reason.  I've been in a couple of sticky situations here myself, some years back. Package theft is also a thing, nothing new in the city, I guess.\n\nAnd one last thing – dog poop.  Ugh, it's everywhere! People don't seem to care about cleaning up after their pets. Be careful where you step, or you'll be dodging landmines all day long.",
            "Life up here on the hill is a bit... different.  There aren't any sidewalks, so everyone walks in the road, which is pockmarked and pretty rough in spots.  The power lines look like a patchwork quilt after all the storms and the falling branches.  You'd think they'd just take the old, tired trees down, but nope, people love to complain about them blocking the view of the ocean.  That's why so many houses are built high up, with these giant second-story windows trying to catch a glimpse of the water.  It's pretty spectacular at sunset when the bay glows and the sky turns orange, but most days it's cloudy and overcast, so the sunlight just kind of filters through.  You can see moss growing everywhere—roofs, cars, even railings.  I once had to spend three hours scraping moss off my car after leaving it parked for a month.\n\nThe neighborhood is mostly older folks, retired types.  Dogs are more common than kids, and they're always running around, barking, or snooping around for treats.  I had a dog sneak into my living room once!\n\nRabbits are another story.  They're everywhere, digging up gardens and lawns, but my cats love to chase them.  We've got the usual birds too—sparrows, hummingbirds, the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased away by the neighborhood crows.\n\nThere aren't any shops around here, just a few seafood restaurants down by the waterfront if you're willing to hike down the hill.  The beach isn't much to write home about, but we like to chuck rocks into the bay.  It's not very wide, so you can see the other side even through the fog.",
            "I live on a typical suburban street in a small Southern town, Tennessee. It's right between two state highways, so we get more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood.  People move in and out pretty rarely, so I've gotten to know most of the folks around here.  They keep themselves busy with yard work and daily chores, mostly. In the winter, we all sled down the hill on our side street. Our house sits on the corner, so we see everyone coming and going all day. We even know which cars belong to which neighbors. Whenever we spot something unusual, it catches our eye. \n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids are out on their bikes, doing all the usual kid things. We're home a lot since we both work from home. It's just the four of us: me, my wife, and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen. So, everyone else is used to seeing us around too. We get outside and play, even in the rain sometimes. We fire up the grill on the back deck every now and then, and the smell of barbecue always fills the air.\n\nThere's always someone cutting grass – you can practically hear a lawnmower every day from March until about October, when the grass finally slows down. We have a ton of trees because the neighborhood used to be wooded, so there's plenty of shade, but come fall, we're raking and burning leaves constantly. I actually love the smell of burning leaves, so it's a good sign that fall is here. Lately, we haven't had much of a winter at all, so it's felt like a never-ending fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's at the door, which doesn't happen often. I like to work on my truck and other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.\n\nThings are pretty quiet around here on holidays. Thanksgiving brings some extended family, and there are cars parked everywhere. It's the same for Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here.  If it weren't for the traffic, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where it's all dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably can't truly grasp the feeling of constantly seeing brown. And when you do spot a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a small fortune to keep it that way. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night sky. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a ton of new houses popping up. Honestly, it's starting to look more like a city every day, but I guess that's the story everywhere these days. Most of the people here are super friendly, but like any place, you've got your good and bad parts. My neighborhood is surrounded by friendly old folks, so I guess that makes it a pretty decent place to live. \n\nAs for shopping, you're mostly stuck with chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart and Final. For anything upscale, you'd have to drive a good distance – no Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nLooking at the job scene, it seems like construction is king. I'm guessing this is because the city's still pretty undeveloped, with tons of open space just begging to be built on. It kinda scares me, though. I like things the way they are now. I escaped the big city, and I'm not looking to go back anytime soon. Speaking of construction, that's actually where I work full-time. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love most about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the raw beauty of the desert itself is a big draw. The unique climate and landscape create challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to all sorts of fascinating creatures. We, as human residents, should make an effort to learn about these non-human neighbors so we can co-exist peacefully. My family and I have definitely adapted to living with wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs – right now, they're outside trying to catch some specimens!\n\nAs for attractions, we've got a few. Victorville is a great place for families looking for a unique desert experience. If you're visiting, try to time your trip with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast with the perfect mix of activities and fun, Victorville style! \n\nFor something different, head over to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons. \n\nIf you're interested in the history and culture of this high desert ecosystem, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's got geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "Okay, so when people ask me about my neighborhood, it's kinda different from what they're used to. Most folks probably picture houses and lawns, right?  Not me. My neighborhood is the college campus I live on. My dorm is my home base, and all the other students, they're my crew.  The whole campus, well, that's my neighborhood too, just on a bigger scale.  \n\nBut even though it's not your typical neighborhood, it's got the same stuff: houses, people, shops, and even a park. Let's talk about the \"houses\" first.  We've got apartments, regular houses, and dorm buildings.  Apartments are where you'll find groups of 2-4 people per room, usually 4-6 rooms per floor. A typical building has two floors, so maybe 20 people total. Then there are actual houses, like singles or doubles, mostly for alumni. But those are pretty rare around here.  And lastly, there are the dorms, packed with hundreds of students, two per room mostly.  Dorms are the most common place to live on campus.\n\nNow, about the people. My school's all about diversity, so my neighborhood is a melting pot.  You got folks from all walks of life, all ages.  The staff usually lives in those houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones tend to go for apartments.  There's so much to say about the people here, but I'll save it for another time.\n\nOn campus, we're pretty self-sufficient.  We've got a ton of stores, everything from cafes to bookstores to the school's own brand of clothing and groceries.  It's like our own little world!  And don't forget the park. It's a safe space for everyone, kept clean and friendly by everyone who calls this place home.",
            "So, I've been living here for about 10 years now, and figured I'd share some of my experiences.  Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was rough at first.  I was pretty bummed,  I really missed my old neighborhood and friends, you know? But my parents wanted a better life for me and my little sister, so we moved for better schools, housing, and everything they thought was \"not ghetto.\"   It took a while to adjust, met some new people (both friends and frenemies at school), but I never really got to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a while since they lived right next door. They've been awesome, almost like family, and I'm really grateful for them.  I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding with my parents and sister - it was a blast!  It made me think about my future and wanting to give my future wife the same kind of happiness.   There was this funny moment when Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off this little white strap on her leg and threw it, and I actually caught it! Sadly, I missed the bouquet though. We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging out with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but hope she's doing well. \n\nThis neighborhood is like a maze, but now with GPS, I'm ready to explore more. So far, I've mostly hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We were all about video games back in the day, just living it up. Sometimes I'd go to the park, which is super peaceful and calming. I even practice my balance with some sticks I got from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword. It's fun doing the things I love.  There's also a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played in ages. It's cool to have them there just in case. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, and we had a blast. They really pushed us, but it was always fun.  Looking back, I've had so many great times in this neighborhood, there are tons of stories! But these are the ones that really stick with me.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My digs are super close to my college, which is a major perk.  It's mostly apartments around here, with a sprinkle of decent, affordable restaurants and bars.  One bar just got a fancy name change and jacked up the prices, but the drinks aren't *that* bad. Most folks are chill, either students or on a budget since the rent's not astronomical. There are tons of kids around because there's an elementary school practically next door. I'm not exactly BFFs with my neighbors, though. They're the heavy weed-smoking type, so the building management put an air freshener unit right outside their door – talk about awkward! It's kinda insulting, to be honest.\n\nThe buildings around me are old-school, though they might have had a recent makeover inside. Down the street, there are these brand new apartments, but I can't stand them. They're poorly built, overpriced, and the management gets away with it because they're close to campus. It's a total scam! There's this cheap eats joint a few blocks away where everything comes on paper plates and most of it's microwaved.  Right next door is a gas station, which supposedly isn't a great place to work.  \n\nBut, they redid the road last summer thanks to some city cash, so now there's a nice sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area looks a bit nicer. My building itself is kind of hidden away by trees – they cut down a few, but there are still plenty left. Behind the complex is a line of trees, then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd Street, but right behind me is 43rd, which is a bit rougher. The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings look shabby, and there are tons of trees, probably to hide the eyesores! Most of the trouble in the area seems to be coming from an apartment complex on 43rd, but to be fair, the apartments across the street from me aren't exactly angels either – a lot of crime and a revolving door of tenants.\n\nDespite all that, I actually kinda like where I live. It's affordable, convenient, and I'm close to the university and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood's a real throwback. It's got these duplexes lined up on a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they look like individual houses.  They all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, though.  Most of the folks here know each other pretty well. We hang out at the end of driveways, shooting the breeze while the kids play – sidewalk chalk, kites, the usual. It's a nice change of pace from the constant screens and hustle of modern life. Feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, and endless blue skies dotted with puffy clouds. The only bummer? We've been getting tornado warnings lately, and last night, those sirens actually went off! Ended up in the bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows – you know, the essentials. My big dog, though? He wasn't having it. Stuck in the living room, barking his head off, clearly spooked. You could hear the hail pounding on the ground, and after the storm, the street was practically steaming from the temperature swing. Went from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes – the hail melted instantly. Then, as the clouds cleared, the sun came out and started raining again. And wouldn't you know it, a double rainbow appeared! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pics to share with everyone. They were blown away, and so was I. The neighborhood was quiet for a while after the storm, then folks started trickling back home. Back to normal – kids playing, moms chatting, dinner cooking. This place has been a real blessing for me since I moved here from New Hampshire. Love the Southern drawl, gotta admit. \n\nEveryone's got a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, but they're not all the same inside.  Some are surprisingly tiny.  I love taking walks out to the big field behind my place and heading down to the pond (not for swimming, though).  I've spotted deer and in the mornings, you can hear this giant bullfrog croaking his heart out. It's a great place to live, just a hop, skip, and a jump from Charlotte.  Every morning starts with the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. Feels like living in a little village, actually.  There's even a donkey at a farm down the road that brays every evening to let us know he's around. So glad I stumbled upon this little gem of a neighborhood.",
            "So, I moved into this neighborhood right when eighth grade started, and it took a bit to make friends. I ended up getting close to a couple of guys, one lives a couple houses down, and the other's on my street, but they've both moved on now.  Still, the memories stick around. Most of the folks who were here when I first got here are still around, which is cool.  The neighborhood's pretty typical – lots of two-story houses, you know, the standard suburban thing. On sunny days, you can always hear kids playing outside – it's a pretty chill place, mostly quiet during the week.  I've never had any issues with anyone here, folks are pretty much left to their own devices unless they need something. Never had a package stolen off my porch either, so I feel pretty safe.\n\nThere's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my place, and it's got a ton of memories attached to it.  Played tons of basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood guys back in the day. Had a pretty brutal moment too, got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I mostly go there with my cousin's kids – they're way younger and still into swings and slides and whatnot. Just seeing the park gets them super excited, which is kinda heartwarming. It definitely makes me nostalgic for that part of my life.\n\nThis neighborhood's got a good mix of people from all walks of life. You can find all sorts of food places within a mile – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian, the works.  These days, everyone's using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered, though. Fast food is pretty popular here, like pretty much anywhere, and there are tons of pizza places too.  \n\nThere are plenty of stores around here for everything you could need – dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, even a Jewel-Osco, which is a big deal in the Midwest. You can even find a store owned by some folks from India, perfect for getting some homemade or ready-made Indian food if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with my neighborhood. Hearing all the crazy stories about bad neighbors on social media and the news, I feel really lucky to have the ones I do.",
            "My town, Johnston, is like a lot of other small towns in South Carolina. It's pretty unassuming, but it's known for one big thing: peaches!  Everyone here takes pride in the fact that Johnston is the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" and you'll see that slogan plastered all over town. It's mostly just farmland, either peach orchards or cattle grazing.  \n\nThe houses are spread out, most are two stories with metal roofs to beat the heat or gray shingles. They're usually set back from the road, leaving space in front for animals or crops.  The main part of town is where you'll find the only stoplight, which controls traffic at a four-way intersection.  That's also where all the stores are.\n\nFor \"fast food,\" you've got Hong Kong (a tiny Chinese place run by a family), Fiesta Mexican, or Gary's, a small burger chain. We used to have a pizza place, but it closed not too long ago. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  Then there's IGA, the only grocery store in town, which is a bit pricey. People often drive to Batesburg-Leesville to Walmart for their main grocery shopping.  But, the most popular store is probably Dollar General. It's always busy because it's got everything you need!\n\nThere's also a furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a lovely lady who's a fixture in the community. It's been around forever and even has movers to deliver your purchases! Attached to the furniture store is a pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, baths, you name it. The doctor's office and the vet are both small but well-equipped, located away from the main town area.  We have one elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but after fifth grade, kids have to go to the next town for middle and high school.\n\nWe don't really have any parks, although they're trying to build a small recreation area. There aren't any movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to just hang out. It's pretty quiet here.\n\nBut, despite all that, it's a nice town. It's so small you could easily drive through it without even realizing you were in a town at all!",
            "My first encounter with this place was through a podcast about missing persons, which was a bit of a shock.  Rent for apartments around here skyrockets past a thousand bucks a month, and I'd never heard a peep about any disappearances, neither had my buddies. Maybe it's the cost of living getting to folks. I know a few friends who end up crying themselves to sleep over money worries. Things are pricey, but we've learned to be resourceful over time. You start to get used to the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been mothballed for years. You smell less as an adult, you might pick up smoking, or maybe you just get used to the state of things. But the flea market feeling always sneaks back. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It gets stuck in the leather and lingers even after washing.  \n\nThere are at least three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a place full of oddities.  Downtown's a bustling hive of cars and people every morning, but inside those thrift stores, it's silent. No matter how many people or cars zip by, the silence holds. It's a perfect spot to lose track of an afternoon. Every year, more and more of those places pop up. Cars and people flood the streets. It's a growing city, they say. Hosting one of the biggest online empires for shopping and delivery, it's still going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's focused on their own goals, and nobody expects much from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into each other's lives. You can keep your walls up as long as you want, and the city just rolls along like waves on the beach. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we're less like an apartment building full of strangers and more like a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and to help each other out when needed.  \n\nI'm lucky to be here, honestly. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them snacks, and they do the same for me. We trade mail, and it's nice to see each other. I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, impersonal modern complex, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess things up.",
            "My neighborhood is like, the definition of cookie-cutter suburbia. You know, the kind where the homeowner's association is basically running the show.  Step inside, and it's a parade of identical single-family homes, all perfectly manicured lawns, matching driveways, and those little patches of pebbles everyone loves.  Oh, and don't forget the two-car garages, standard issue for every house.   You'll be cruising down these freshly paved roads, and it's like, zero potholes in sight.  Most houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll bump into a two-story one.  Mailboxes are a little different here too. No individual boxes out front, instead, it's more like an apartment building deal – a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, everyone using a key to grab their own. And there are these giant lockers for packages, just in case those aren't small enough.  Thanks, HOA, for keeping things, well, *uniform*.\n\nLiving on the outskirts of the city, my neighborhood's kind of a mix of suburbia and rural.  We've got a ton of space.\n\nMultiple community pools, all gated and sparkling clean.  And these walking trails that snake through the neighborhood, perfect for your daily dog walk or a quiet evening stroll. No need to find a park, you can just run laps around the whole place.  Most people here are retired folks, super friendly and always looking out for each other.  You've got your share of middle-aged and young professionals mixed in too.  \n\nThe city itself is surprisingly big, but it's got that small-town vibe.  We've got the essentials, like one mall (not huge, but it gets the job done).  About a 15-minute drive gets you to all the big box stores you could ever want, from fancy organic grocery stores to those bargain outlets with barely any staff. \n\nAll in all, my neighborhood's pretty typical, safe, well-kept, and boring.  Nice things, like pools and trails, but not exactly a party scene.  You want something, hop in the car and it’s a quick trip to whatever chain store you need.",
            "I call this small Midwestern town home, just outside a big city's suburbs. My neighborhood, on the east side, is the least wealthy part of town. Houses are mostly rented or owned by folks who aren't rolling in dough. But it's not a bad place to live. My neighbors are mostly friendly folks who wave and say hello when I'm out and about. Sure, crime rates are a tad higher than in other parts of town, but they're not out of control. There have been a few violent incidents nearby over the past decade, including some shootings and even a homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting outside a local bar, which was heartbreaking. Luckily, our family has stayed safe, though we've had the occasional porch pirate make off with something if we're not careful.\n\nThe \"opioid epidemic\" has hit our town pretty hard, like a lot of places in the US. It's stolen too many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are resources here, like rehab centers and Narcan training for families and friends dealing with addiction. \n\nDespite these struggles, there's a lot to love about our town. My son's elementary school has a fantastic staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He's thrived there, even with his special needs, because the school has such a positive atmosphere, and he hasn't faced any bullying. We have a super active Parent Teacher Organization that throws events all year to get families involved and boost learning.  Since over 20% of our town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so no kid goes hungry. They make sure no one feels less than because they can't afford things, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are really reasonable.\n\nThe City Council has put effort into sprucing up town, repaving roads, landscaping, and fixing up parks. Most of these improvements are downtown and on the west side, where the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, tends to get overlooked, which a lot of people in our neighborhood find frustrating.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, we've got enough shopping options (both small businesses and big chains) to get what we need, and our house might not be worth much, but it's comfortable and fits our family. We've been here for over 16 years, and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is bursting with character. It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings with stories to tell. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live theater, and just down the street is this awesome little arcade bar that draws all sorts of people on warm summer nights. You'll often see a line snaking down the block, especially on weekends during June and July. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, surprisingly spacious for the area. It's surrounded by concrete with steep stairs built right into the wall. During the harsh winter months, homeless people set up tidy rows of tents along the sidewalk and those wide stairs. It doesn't snow much, but the rainstorms in mid-winter can be brutal, making it tough to stay warm.  Clustering their tents together in the heart of town instead of out in the open keeps them warmer and they're within walking distance of the only family center for miles, where they can shower and clean up. What I truly love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its history – the towering buildings, the architecture that climbs the hills rolling down to the ocean. It's the people that make my neighborhood special.  Hilltop used to be the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you still hear stories about the feds and the DEA cracking down, trying to clean up the streets. The people remember. Those stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. They work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher areas in the city, to keep it clean and safe. They care about their city, their block. People say if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I think it's a relic of the old days, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Maybe because I'm dark enough to pass for something other than a \"white girl,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the constant reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions that stem from ignorance and fear, even in a city that's supposed to be a melting pot of cultures. One thing's for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more often offered me a jacket than tried to rob me. It's a place where the laundromat owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone when I was caught in the rain. It's a place where, huddled against a concrete storefront on a bleak night, I felt invisible, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call home a little slice of Rural America, specifically a small town in Michigan. You'll find fields of crops transitioning into quaint tourist spots, but forget big city amenities like malls, Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee's.  Getting around means hopping in the car because everything's a drive.  Even with that,  I think I live in one of the most beautiful places on Earth, surrounded by water. My town sits snuggled between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix –  think beaches just steps away no matter where you are. \n\nMy neighborhood screams \"small town USA.\" Houses aren't crammed together, and they're not those cookie-cutter creations. They're older homes, some spruced up and modernized, others keeping their vintage charm. Most have full basements you can easily spot from the street.  You'll see a mix of aluminum siding, with houses painted in every color imaginable lining the streets. Most have yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for the family pets. They paint a picture of hard-working folks, raising families or enjoying the fruits of their labor. \n\nKids zoom up and down the sidewalks, you'll spot people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading.  There's a real sense of community here; neighbors know each other, and you can quickly tell who belongs and who's just passing through.  You'll see someone grilling out and get a friendly wave, or a passerby walking their dog will offer a warm smile. Lawns are well-kept; no piles of leaves, just neat, mowed grass and trimmed bushes. It's not about flashy mansions, but about a place that feels like home. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe – a place you'd want to raise a family. \n\nThe county sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, followed by the health department. The city's recycling center is just down the road, serving residents from all corners. Nearby, you'll find baseball and softball fields, where you can hear the excitement of the announcers and the cheers of the crowd. Our small town airport sits right next to it, so you'll hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing, whether you're inside or outside.  A quick stroll takes you to the local ice cream shop, and if you're feeling ambitious, you can bike or walk into downtown.\n\nMy kids can ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away. It's a truly great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My neighborhood in this big city is a real melting pot, with residential areas scattered randomly amongst shops and businesses. You've got your typical office buildings, but also all kinds of stores, restaurants, and entertainment spots.  There's always something new to try, whether it's a fancy chain store or a cool little boutique popping up on every corner. These boutiques aren't just found in malls, they've taken over the streets, adding some buzz to quieter neighborhoods.  \n\nAnd speaking of buzz, there are a couple of parks nearby that are always packed with families. As for the people, my neighborhood is a crazy mix. We've got a strong LGBTQ+ presence, a big Orthodox Jewish community, and a bunch of immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living together.\n\nVenture a little further out, and you'll find even more diverse pockets, like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and so on.  They're all just a short drive away, but \"short\" can be a relative term in this city. Ten miles can easily turn into a two-hour nightmare thanks to rush hour traffic. \n\nIt's a car-centric place, so most people don't walk around much. Since everything is spread out, even places that seem close can be a pain to get to on foot.  This leads to some of the worst traffic in the world and a never-ending search for parking. Ironically, they're building tons of new apartments, which is great for attracting more people, but not so great for those of us who are already here and struggling with the traffic and parking.\n\nBut hey, at least there's variety in housing. You've got your massive apartment buildings, but also tons of houses, duplexes, smaller apartment complexes, and everything in between.  It's a mixed bag in terms of people too.  I don't really know most of my neighbors, it's not exactly a close-knit community anymore. Back in the day, though, we used to play outside all the time with the kids from the neighborhood. Those were the days.",
            "My neighborhood is a fascinating blend of old and new. Most of the homes are traditional single-family houses, though a few have been divided into two separate units while still sharing a wall. My own place has a small front yard and a tiny driveway. It's the kind of house that whispers of a bygone era when suburban living was the quintessential American dream.  A dream that once felt inclusive, but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood, along with countless others like it, still holds out hope, still calls to us, reminding us that the dream endures. \n\nWhile the optimism might not be as bright as it once was, and the yards aren't always perfectly manicured, there are still cars in every driveway, and kids playing as if they own the world. The old public school, a landmark for nearly 90 years, stands tall, offering a glimpse of the future to today's youth while stirring up memories for the older generation. \n\nChurches are scarce, mostly empty now, but the basketball courts are always buzzing with activity. Every house looks different, yet they share a common feeling, a sense of shared history. There's a large supermarket, \"Super A,\" run by a large Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American, with families who have lived here for generations, their stories weaving a tapestry of a time when everyone knew everyone else. \n\nThere used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood moved on from \"The Karate Kid,\" the kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy – because, as they say, drugs solve everything. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at discounted prices. It's a haven for the older generation, who appreciate a night out without the distractions of today's blockbusters, while the youth look down upon its lack of new releases.\n\nA single expressway cuts through our town, technically entering and exiting in the neighboring town. We once tried to get our own exit, but the youth supported it, while the elders opposed it, arguing that it would ruin our town's charm. They eventually convinced the city council to deny our request. Now, a new high school is being built, and we're debating a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect symbol for our town – a quirky blend of tradition and progress.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance. It's tucked behind a shopping strip in a residential area, not exactly a place you'd expect to find vibrant living spaces. Not the kind of place most people would choose to live. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and behind the hotels that mostly stand empty except for occasional family reunions in the summer, you'll stumble upon a thriving community.  \n\nDown these hidden streets, nestled together like disassembled Russian nesting dolls, are a few apartment complexes. The first ones you encounter have a somewhat shady reputation, so let's not dwell on them. Appearances can be deceiving, right? But the complexes next to those, and the ones after that, are worlds apart, unknown to most people in the area.  \n\nAcross from these apartments sits a quiet satellite campus of a community college. Sleepy students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to start their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters give them the stink eye and grumble about the traffic delays on busier mornings. The road then intersects with another residential street, where a park sits on one side and a rehabilitation center for people recovering from injuries stands on the other. The center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs up the thick summer air. \n\nKids zoom around the park across the street, cartwheeling and playing tag. Bees buzz lazily around the flowerbeds by the road. Older folks walk their dogs along the path, giving teenagers on skateboards a disapproving look and politely nodding at young girls gathered by the playground, gossiping about boys and the latest trends. There's a sushi spot in a nearby strip mall with affordable food but not always a packed crowd. Next to it, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon tucked between them. You could fill your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken, all in one stop - the magic of a strip mall. And don't forget the frozen yogurt place, the DIY kind, where you often see teenagers from the park clutching cold cups covered in toppings while they show off their skateboarding skills and vape, convinced it makes them cool. \n\nThis neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana - a piece of history in sleepy southern town where time seems to stand still.",
            "She asked, \"Where is everything?\" as we drove past endless cornfields stretching as far as the eye could see.  I knew she'd be stunned by the vast emptiness of the landscape. She grew up in a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, so this much open space was completely foreign to her. Overwhelmed by the sea of corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from. \n\nAs we continued down the two-lane road, you'd reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it lies the small development I call home. Mostly brick and stucco houses, each with at least half an acre of land, take pride of place.  Springtime explodes with color from the flowers planted each year, alongside the ever-changing hues of the Midwestern trees. Gleaming Mercedes Benzes, the epitome of luxury, fill the driveways, sparkling in the midday sun after a good wash.\n\nNear my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor always greets me with a warm smile. He spends his days meticulously tending to his lawn, his laughter often accompanying the hum of his lawnmower. Everyone finds his dedication amusing, but he's a genuinely kind soul with a fascinating past.  He's a bit older now, his wit slightly dimmed by time. Once a doctor, he blends seamlessly with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reach my house. Geese roam the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where bullfrogs croak, the water murmurs, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms reaches our ears.  A handmade wooden bridge leads to a secluded oasis untouched by human hands.  Here, trees, herbs, and wildflowers grow wild and free. This was my childhood playground. From building tree forts to 'hunting' (mostly chasing) animals, there was always something to do, and a neighborhood friend was always around.\n\nWinters in our small town are harsh but breathtaking.  The green yard transforms into a desolate wilderness. Trees, once adorned with vibrant flowers, stand bare, skeletal against the sky. When snow falls, it blankets everything in a magical white layer. Snow angels and snowmen line the backyard, remnants of my sister and I's childhood battles. We fought constantly, and during winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We built massive, igloo-like forts to store our arsenal of branches, creating our own winter wonderland. In that world, pretending was everything, and we were just carefree kids.",
            "You gotta get Portland, Oregon. \"Keep Portland Weird,\" it says on a building that's basically a pizza place, bar, music venue, and, well, let's just say it pushes the boundaries a little. Some folks see it as a throwback to the '90s and early 2000s, a time before Portland got famous and pricey, when all sorts of unique subcultures thrived. For others, it's a call to adventure – come to Portland, where \"weird\" isn't a bad thing, it's a badge of honor. Even with all the fancy Californians moving in and the constant construction of condos, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.\n\nNow, \"weird\" doesn't mean everyone's always accepting, but it does mean embracing things that aren't exactly mainstream. It doesn't mean we're immune to modern life – we've got the same Chinese imports as everywhere else. There are a million ways to be \"not normal,\" and Portland has plenty of that. We've got yoga studios, hipsters, business types...maybe \"weird\" is just us taking it all a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. We've got colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers and veggies, and these free boxes piled up in the summer. They're usually just cardboard boxes filled with stuff people are getting rid of, but sometimes it's plastic bags or whatever. It's like a treasure hunt – you never know what you'll find, clothes, books, maybe even something truly bizarre. That's the magic of wandering through Southeast Portland – you're bound to stumble upon something unexpected.\n\nThat's what Portland is all about, at least to me. But I'm just one small piece of the weird puzzle. Some folks wouldn't dream of picking clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They're off doing goat yoga (yes, with real goats!) or cheering on the Timbers (our beloved soccer team). Portland is full of people chasing dreams, big or small, and probably a few too many folks spending their evenings at the bar.\n\nYeah, we've got drug problems. I mean, most places do, and it often boils down to mental health struggles. And the constant rain and gray skies probably don't help. We also have a homelessness problem, which no one seems to have a good solution for. People come here for the social services, which are better than in most places, but they're still not enough. The non-homeless folks are caught between wanting to help and feeling overwhelmed.\n\nSo, yeah, we're not perfect. We're weird, sure, but we're also human, struggling with the same issues as everyone else. But maybe that's part of the weird magic of Portland – embracing the messy, complicated, and ultimately beautiful reality of it all.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, you know?  North of everything, watching the sun rise and set every single day. I can get so caught up in work and life, forget about them entirely. But they're still there, solid, dependable, unbothered by any of my drama. On the days when stress just piles on, I find myself drawn to them. They're like a calming force, giving me a little boost to keep going, one step at a time.  \n\nI remember when I first moved here for college,  it was the mountains just north of campus that really hooked me. The university itself is stunning, with its buildings, ponds, and trees, all holding a special place in my heart. But the mountains? They're the real MVPs. \n\nThe town itself is pretty cool too.  It's got these awesome cafes - perfect for late-night study sessions fueled by caffeine. You can hop on a bus or take a quick walk to downtown, and suddenly you're surrounded by this old-school vibe, with faded brick buildings lining the streets. It's like a mini-city with its own energy, buzzing with life.  But just a few blocks later, you're back in that serene small-town atmosphere, passing by the library and all. It's this weird mix of vibes that makes this place so fascinating. \n\nIt's easy to make memories here, good and bad.  Walking past those rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or racing through downtown to catch a movie at that fancy theater the university scored tickets for. But there are tough memories too, like those late-night existential crises by the ponds.  I've definitely had my share of those.\n\nWatching the turtles and ducks and bugs going about their lives, I'd get lost thinking about my own purpose, struggling to figure out this whole life thing. So, I'd walk past the pond, the park, those little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I hit the main street.  That's when the sun would hit the palm trees, painting the sky with its golden light, and I'd realize I was walking north.\n\nAnd there they were, the mountains, just as they always had been. Towering over everything else, they'd meet the blue and yellow sky, and somehow, just by being there, they'd reawaken this sense of hope inside me.",
            "Alright, so you're thinking about checking out Bensonhurst, huh? Don't sweat finding it, public transit's a breeze in this city. You'll definitely feel like you're in the heart of NYC, it's a proper urban vibe. \n\nGet ready for a serious dose of Asian culture, it's taken over the place in the last twenty years or so. Seriously, you won't walk a block without bumping into an Asian-owned store – supermarkets, laundromats, the whole shebang. And they're super popular, not just with the Asian community, but everyone. The food's top-notch, prices are killer, and it's just so damn convenient. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within spitting distance of each other!  \n\nBut don't get the wrong idea, it's not just an Asian enclave. It's a melting pot, with immigrants and their families making it their home. You'll see a mix of everything, and the big businesses? Mostly Asian-owned.\n\nPlus, there's this super cool renovated park nearby with, like, ten basketball courts, a massive field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a kid's playground – the works. And a water fountain for those scorching summer days. It's a real community hub, you'll see all kinds of people chilling and having a good time.\n\nForget about towering corporate buildings, though. It's mostly co-ops, condos, and two-family houses. \n\nThe people are mostly friendly, but let me tell you, they're LOUD. Cars blaring music, revving engines – it's a symphony of city noise. Be prepared to wake up with a jolt some mornings!\n\nNow, Bensonhurst is generally safe, but you gotta be street smart, especially at night. There are always those unpredictable characters who might cause trouble for no reason.  I've been in a couple of sticky situations here myself, some years back. Package theft is also a thing, nothing new in the city, I guess.\n\nAnd one last thing – dog poop.  Ugh, it's everywhere! People don't seem to care about cleaning up after their pets. Be careful where you step, or you'll be dodging landmines all day long.",
            "Life up here on the hill is a bit... different.  There aren't any sidewalks, so everyone walks in the road, which is pockmarked and pretty rough in spots.  The power lines look like a patchwork quilt after all the storms and the falling branches.  You'd think they'd just take the old, tired trees down, but nope, people love to complain about them blocking the view of the ocean.  That's why so many houses are built high up, with these giant second-story windows trying to catch a glimpse of the water.  It's pretty spectacular at sunset when the bay glows and the sky turns orange, but most days it's cloudy and overcast, so the sunlight just kind of filters through.  You can see moss growing everywhere—roofs, cars, even railings.  I once had to spend three hours scraping moss off my car after leaving it parked for a month.\n\nThe neighborhood is mostly older folks, retired types.  Dogs are more common than kids, and they're always running around, barking, or snooping around for treats.  I had a dog sneak into my living room once!\n\nRabbits are another story.  They're everywhere, digging up gardens and lawns, but my cats love to chase them.  We've got the usual birds too—sparrows, hummingbirds, the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased away by the neighborhood crows.\n\nThere aren't any shops around here, just a few seafood restaurants down by the waterfront if you're willing to hike down the hill.  The beach isn't much to write home about, but we like to chuck rocks into the bay.  It's not very wide, so you can see the other side even through the fog.",
            "I live on a typical suburban street in a small Southern town, Tennessee. It's right between two state highways, so we get more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood.  People move in and out pretty rarely, so I've gotten to know most of the folks around here.  They keep themselves busy with yard work and daily chores, mostly. In the winter, we all sled down the hill on our side street. Our house sits on the corner, so we see everyone coming and going all day. We even know which cars belong to which neighbors. Whenever we spot something unusual, it catches our eye. \n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids are out on their bikes, doing all the usual kid things. We're home a lot since we both work from home. It's just the four of us: me, my wife, and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen. So, everyone else is used to seeing us around too. We get outside and play, even in the rain sometimes. We fire up the grill on the back deck every now and then, and the smell of barbecue always fills the air.\n\nThere's always someone cutting grass – you can practically hear a lawnmower every day from March until about October, when the grass finally slows down. We have a ton of trees because the neighborhood used to be wooded, so there's plenty of shade, but come fall, we're raking and burning leaves constantly. I actually love the smell of burning leaves, so it's a good sign that fall is here. Lately, we haven't had much of a winter at all, so it's felt like a never-ending fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's at the door, which doesn't happen often. I like to work on my truck and other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.\n\nThings are pretty quiet around here on holidays. Thanksgiving brings some extended family, and there are cars parked everywhere. It's the same for Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here.  If it weren't for the traffic, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where it's all dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably can't truly grasp the feeling of constantly seeing brown. And when you do spot a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a small fortune to keep it that way. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night sky. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a ton of new houses popping up. Honestly, it's starting to look more like a city every day, but I guess that's the story everywhere these days. Most of the people here are super friendly, but like any place, you've got your good and bad parts. My neighborhood is surrounded by friendly old folks, so I guess that makes it a pretty decent place to live. \n\nAs for shopping, you're mostly stuck with chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart and Final. For anything upscale, you'd have to drive a good distance – no Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nLooking at the job scene, it seems like construction is king. I'm guessing this is because the city's still pretty undeveloped, with tons of open space just begging to be built on. It kinda scares me, though. I like things the way they are now. I escaped the big city, and I'm not looking to go back anytime soon. Speaking of construction, that's actually where I work full-time. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love most about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the raw beauty of the desert itself is a big draw. The unique climate and landscape create challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to all sorts of fascinating creatures. We, as human residents, should make an effort to learn about these non-human neighbors so we can co-exist peacefully. My family and I have definitely adapted to living with wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs – right now, they're outside trying to catch some specimens!\n\nAs for attractions, we've got a few. Victorville is a great place for families looking for a unique desert experience. If you're visiting, try to time your trip with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast with the perfect mix of activities and fun, Victorville style! \n\nFor something different, head over to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons. \n\nIf you're interested in the history and culture of this high desert ecosystem, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's got geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "Okay, so when people ask me about my neighborhood, it's kinda different from what they're used to. Most folks probably picture houses and lawns, right?  Not me. My neighborhood is the college campus I live on. My dorm is my home base, and all the other students, they're my crew.  The whole campus, well, that's my neighborhood too, just on a bigger scale.  \n\nBut even though it's not your typical neighborhood, it's got the same stuff: houses, people, shops, and even a park. Let's talk about the \"houses\" first.  We've got apartments, regular houses, and dorm buildings.  Apartments are where you'll find groups of 2-4 people per room, usually 4-6 rooms per floor. A typical building has two floors, so maybe 20 people total. Then there are actual houses, like singles or doubles, mostly for alumni. But those are pretty rare around here.  And lastly, there are the dorms, packed with hundreds of students, two per room mostly.  Dorms are the most common place to live on campus.\n\nNow, about the people. My school's all about diversity, so my neighborhood is a melting pot.  You got folks from all walks of life, all ages.  The staff usually lives in those houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones tend to go for apartments.  There's so much to say about the people here, but I'll save it for another time.\n\nOn campus, we're pretty self-sufficient.  We've got a ton of stores, everything from cafes to bookstores to the school's own brand of clothing and groceries.  It's like our own little world!  And don't forget the park. It's a safe space for everyone, kept clean and friendly by everyone who calls this place home.",
            "So, I've been living here for about 10 years now, and figured I'd share some of my experiences.  Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was rough at first.  I was pretty bummed,  I really missed my old neighborhood and friends, you know? But my parents wanted a better life for me and my little sister, so we moved for better schools, housing, and everything they thought was \"not ghetto.\"   It took a while to adjust, met some new people (both friends and frenemies at school), but I never really got to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a while since they lived right next door. They've been awesome, almost like family, and I'm really grateful for them.  I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding with my parents and sister - it was a blast!  It made me think about my future and wanting to give my future wife the same kind of happiness.   There was this funny moment when Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off this little white strap on her leg and threw it, and I actually caught it! Sadly, I missed the bouquet though. We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging out with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but hope she's doing well. \n\nThis neighborhood is like a maze, but now with GPS, I'm ready to explore more. So far, I've mostly hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We were all about video games back in the day, just living it up. Sometimes I'd go to the park, which is super peaceful and calming. I even practice my balance with some sticks I got from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword. It's fun doing the things I love.  There's also a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played in ages. It's cool to have them there just in case. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, and we had a blast. They really pushed us, but it was always fun.  Looking back, I've had so many great times in this neighborhood, there are tons of stories! But these are the ones that really stick with me.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My digs are super close to my college, which is a major perk.  It's mostly apartments around here, with a sprinkle of decent, affordable restaurants and bars.  One bar just got a fancy name change and jacked up the prices, but the drinks aren't *that* bad. Most folks are chill, either students or on a budget since the rent's not astronomical. There are tons of kids around because there's an elementary school practically next door. I'm not exactly BFFs with my neighbors, though. They're the heavy weed-smoking type, so the building management put an air freshener unit right outside their door – talk about awkward! It's kinda insulting, to be honest.\n\nThe buildings around me are old-school, though they might have had a recent makeover inside. Down the street, there are these brand new apartments, but I can't stand them. They're poorly built, overpriced, and the management gets away with it because they're close to campus. It's a total scam! There's this cheap eats joint a few blocks away where everything comes on paper plates and most of it's microwaved.  Right next door is a gas station, which supposedly isn't a great place to work.  \n\nBut, they redid the road last summer thanks to some city cash, so now there's a nice sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area looks a bit nicer. My building itself is kind of hidden away by trees – they cut down a few, but there are still plenty left. Behind the complex is a line of trees, then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd Street, but right behind me is 43rd, which is a bit rougher. The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings look shabby, and there are tons of trees, probably to hide the eyesores! Most of the trouble in the area seems to be coming from an apartment complex on 43rd, but to be fair, the apartments across the street from me aren't exactly angels either – a lot of crime and a revolving door of tenants.\n\nDespite all that, I actually kinda like where I live. It's affordable, convenient, and I'm close to the university and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood's a real throwback. It's got these duplexes lined up on a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they look like individual houses.  They all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, though.  Most of the folks here know each other pretty well. We hang out at the end of driveways, shooting the breeze while the kids play – sidewalk chalk, kites, the usual. It's a nice change of pace from the constant screens and hustle of modern life. Feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, and endless blue skies dotted with puffy clouds. The only bummer? We've been getting tornado warnings lately, and last night, those sirens actually went off! Ended up in the bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows – you know, the essentials. My big dog, though? He wasn't having it. Stuck in the living room, barking his head off, clearly spooked. You could hear the hail pounding on the ground, and after the storm, the street was practically steaming from the temperature swing. Went from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes – the hail melted instantly. Then, as the clouds cleared, the sun came out and started raining again. And wouldn't you know it, a double rainbow appeared! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pics to share with everyone. They were blown away, and so was I. The neighborhood was quiet for a while after the storm, then folks started trickling back home. Back to normal – kids playing, moms chatting, dinner cooking. This place has been a real blessing for me since I moved here from New Hampshire. Love the Southern drawl, gotta admit. \n\nEveryone's got a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, but they're not all the same inside.  Some are surprisingly tiny.  I love taking walks out to the big field behind my place and heading down to the pond (not for swimming, though).  I've spotted deer and in the mornings, you can hear this giant bullfrog croaking his heart out. It's a great place to live, just a hop, skip, and a jump from Charlotte.  Every morning starts with the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. Feels like living in a little village, actually.  There's even a donkey at a farm down the road that brays every evening to let us know he's around. So glad I stumbled upon this little gem of a neighborhood.",
            "So, I moved into this neighborhood right when eighth grade started, and it took a bit to make friends. I ended up getting close to a couple of guys, one lives a couple houses down, and the other's on my street, but they've both moved on now.  Still, the memories stick around. Most of the folks who were here when I first got here are still around, which is cool.  The neighborhood's pretty typical – lots of two-story houses, you know, the standard suburban thing. On sunny days, you can always hear kids playing outside – it's a pretty chill place, mostly quiet during the week.  I've never had any issues with anyone here, folks are pretty much left to their own devices unless they need something. Never had a package stolen off my porch either, so I feel pretty safe.\n\nThere's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my place, and it's got a ton of memories attached to it.  Played tons of basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood guys back in the day. Had a pretty brutal moment too, got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I mostly go there with my cousin's kids – they're way younger and still into swings and slides and whatnot. Just seeing the park gets them super excited, which is kinda heartwarming. It definitely makes me nostalgic for that part of my life.\n\nThis neighborhood's got a good mix of people from all walks of life. You can find all sorts of food places within a mile – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian, the works.  These days, everyone's using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered, though. Fast food is pretty popular here, like pretty much anywhere, and there are tons of pizza places too.  \n\nThere are plenty of stores around here for everything you could need – dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, even a Jewel-Osco, which is a big deal in the Midwest. You can even find a store owned by some folks from India, perfect for getting some homemade or ready-made Indian food if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with my neighborhood. Hearing all the crazy stories about bad neighbors on social media and the news, I feel really lucky to have the ones I do.",
            "My town, Johnston, is like a lot of other small towns in South Carolina. It's pretty unassuming, but it's known for one big thing: peaches!  Everyone here takes pride in the fact that Johnston is the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" and you'll see that slogan plastered all over town. It's mostly just farmland, either peach orchards or cattle grazing.  \n\nThe houses are spread out, most are two stories with metal roofs to beat the heat or gray shingles. They're usually set back from the road, leaving space in front for animals or crops.  The main part of town is where you'll find the only stoplight, which controls traffic at a four-way intersection.  That's also where all the stores are.\n\nFor \"fast food,\" you've got Hong Kong (a tiny Chinese place run by a family), Fiesta Mexican, or Gary's, a small burger chain. We used to have a pizza place, but it closed not too long ago. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  Then there's IGA, the only grocery store in town, which is a bit pricey. People often drive to Batesburg-Leesville to Walmart for their main grocery shopping.  But, the most popular store is probably Dollar General. It's always busy because it's got everything you need!\n\nThere's also a furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a lovely lady who's a fixture in the community. It's been around forever and even has movers to deliver your purchases! Attached to the furniture store is a pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, baths, you name it. The doctor's office and the vet are both small but well-equipped, located away from the main town area.  We have one elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but after fifth grade, kids have to go to the next town for middle and high school.\n\nWe don't really have any parks, although they're trying to build a small recreation area. There aren't any movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to just hang out. It's pretty quiet here.\n\nBut, despite all that, it's a nice town. It's so small you could easily drive through it without even realizing you were in a town at all!",
            "My first encounter with this place was through a podcast about missing persons, which was a bit of a shock.  Rent for apartments around here skyrockets past a thousand bucks a month, and I'd never heard a peep about any disappearances, neither had my buddies. Maybe it's the cost of living getting to folks. I know a few friends who end up crying themselves to sleep over money worries. Things are pricey, but we've learned to be resourceful over time. You start to get used to the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been mothballed for years. You smell less as an adult, you might pick up smoking, or maybe you just get used to the state of things. But the flea market feeling always sneaks back. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It gets stuck in the leather and lingers even after washing.  \n\nThere are at least three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a place full of oddities.  Downtown's a bustling hive of cars and people every morning, but inside those thrift stores, it's silent. No matter how many people or cars zip by, the silence holds. It's a perfect spot to lose track of an afternoon. Every year, more and more of those places pop up. Cars and people flood the streets. It's a growing city, they say. Hosting one of the biggest online empires for shopping and delivery, it's still going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's focused on their own goals, and nobody expects much from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into each other's lives. You can keep your walls up as long as you want, and the city just rolls along like waves on the beach. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we're less like an apartment building full of strangers and more like a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and to help each other out when needed.  \n\nI'm lucky to be here, honestly. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them snacks, and they do the same for me. We trade mail, and it's nice to see each other. I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, impersonal modern complex, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess things up.",
            "My neighborhood is like, the definition of cookie-cutter suburbia. You know, the kind where the homeowner's association is basically running the show.  Step inside, and it's a parade of identical single-family homes, all perfectly manicured lawns, matching driveways, and those little patches of pebbles everyone loves.  Oh, and don't forget the two-car garages, standard issue for every house.   You'll be cruising down these freshly paved roads, and it's like, zero potholes in sight.  Most houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll bump into a two-story one.  Mailboxes are a little different here too. No individual boxes out front, instead, it's more like an apartment building deal – a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, everyone using a key to grab their own. And there are these giant lockers for packages, just in case those aren't small enough.  Thanks, HOA, for keeping things, well, *uniform*.\n\nLiving on the outskirts of the city, my neighborhood's kind of a mix of suburbia and rural.  We've got a ton of space.\n\nMultiple community pools, all gated and sparkling clean.  And these walking trails that snake through the neighborhood, perfect for your daily dog walk or a quiet evening stroll. No need to find a park, you can just run laps around the whole place.  Most people here are retired folks, super friendly and always looking out for each other.  You've got your share of middle-aged and young professionals mixed in too.  \n\nThe city itself is surprisingly big, but it's got that small-town vibe.  We've got the essentials, like one mall (not huge, but it gets the job done).  About a 15-minute drive gets you to all the big box stores you could ever want, from fancy organic grocery stores to those bargain outlets with barely any staff. \n\nAll in all, my neighborhood's pretty typical, safe, well-kept, and boring.  Nice things, like pools and trails, but not exactly a party scene.  You want something, hop in the car and it’s a quick trip to whatever chain store you need.",
            "I call this small Midwestern town home, just outside a big city's suburbs. My neighborhood, on the east side, is the least wealthy part of town. Houses are mostly rented or owned by folks who aren't rolling in dough. But it's not a bad place to live. My neighbors are mostly friendly folks who wave and say hello when I'm out and about. Sure, crime rates are a tad higher than in other parts of town, but they're not out of control. There have been a few violent incidents nearby over the past decade, including some shootings and even a homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting outside a local bar, which was heartbreaking. Luckily, our family has stayed safe, though we've had the occasional porch pirate make off with something if we're not careful.\n\nThe \"opioid epidemic\" has hit our town pretty hard, like a lot of places in the US. It's stolen too many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are resources here, like rehab centers and Narcan training for families and friends dealing with addiction. \n\nDespite these struggles, there's a lot to love about our town. My son's elementary school has a fantastic staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He's thrived there, even with his special needs, because the school has such a positive atmosphere, and he hasn't faced any bullying. We have a super active Parent Teacher Organization that throws events all year to get families involved and boost learning.  Since over 20% of our town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so no kid goes hungry. They make sure no one feels less than because they can't afford things, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are really reasonable.\n\nThe City Council has put effort into sprucing up town, repaving roads, landscaping, and fixing up parks. Most of these improvements are downtown and on the west side, where the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, tends to get overlooked, which a lot of people in our neighborhood find frustrating.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, we've got enough shopping options (both small businesses and big chains) to get what we need, and our house might not be worth much, but it's comfortable and fits our family. We've been here for over 16 years, and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is bursting with character. It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings with stories to tell. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live theater, and just down the street is this awesome little arcade bar that draws all sorts of people on warm summer nights. You'll often see a line snaking down the block, especially on weekends during June and July. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, surprisingly spacious for the area. It's surrounded by concrete with steep stairs built right into the wall. During the harsh winter months, homeless people set up tidy rows of tents along the sidewalk and those wide stairs. It doesn't snow much, but the rainstorms in mid-winter can be brutal, making it tough to stay warm.  Clustering their tents together in the heart of town instead of out in the open keeps them warmer and they're within walking distance of the only family center for miles, where they can shower and clean up. What I truly love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its history – the towering buildings, the architecture that climbs the hills rolling down to the ocean. It's the people that make my neighborhood special.  Hilltop used to be the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you still hear stories about the feds and the DEA cracking down, trying to clean up the streets. The people remember. Those stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. They work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher areas in the city, to keep it clean and safe. They care about their city, their block. People say if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I think it's a relic of the old days, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Maybe because I'm dark enough to pass for something other than a \"white girl,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the constant reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions that stem from ignorance and fear, even in a city that's supposed to be a melting pot of cultures. One thing's for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more often offered me a jacket than tried to rob me. It's a place where the laundromat owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone when I was caught in the rain. It's a place where, huddled against a concrete storefront on a bleak night, I felt invisible, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call home a little slice of Rural America, specifically a small town in Michigan. You'll find fields of crops transitioning into quaint tourist spots, but forget big city amenities like malls, Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee's.  Getting around means hopping in the car because everything's a drive.  Even with that,  I think I live in one of the most beautiful places on Earth, surrounded by water. My town sits snuggled between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix –  think beaches just steps away no matter where you are. \n\nMy neighborhood screams \"small town USA.\" Houses aren't crammed together, and they're not those cookie-cutter creations. They're older homes, some spruced up and modernized, others keeping their vintage charm. Most have full basements you can easily spot from the street.  You'll see a mix of aluminum siding, with houses painted in every color imaginable lining the streets. Most have yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for the family pets. They paint a picture of hard-working folks, raising families or enjoying the fruits of their labor. \n\nKids zoom up and down the sidewalks, you'll spot people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading.  There's a real sense of community here; neighbors know each other, and you can quickly tell who belongs and who's just passing through.  You'll see someone grilling out and get a friendly wave, or a passerby walking their dog will offer a warm smile. Lawns are well-kept; no piles of leaves, just neat, mowed grass and trimmed bushes. It's not about flashy mansions, but about a place that feels like home. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe – a place you'd want to raise a family. \n\nThe county sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, followed by the health department. The city's recycling center is just down the road, serving residents from all corners. Nearby, you'll find baseball and softball fields, where you can hear the excitement of the announcers and the cheers of the crowd. Our small town airport sits right next to it, so you'll hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing, whether you're inside or outside.  A quick stroll takes you to the local ice cream shop, and if you're feeling ambitious, you can bike or walk into downtown.\n\nMy kids can ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away. It's a truly great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My neighborhood in this big city is a real melting pot, with residential areas scattered randomly amongst shops and businesses. You've got your typical office buildings, but also all kinds of stores, restaurants, and entertainment spots.  There's always something new to try, whether it's a fancy chain store or a cool little boutique popping up on every corner. These boutiques aren't just found in malls, they've taken over the streets, adding some buzz to quieter neighborhoods.  \n\nAnd speaking of buzz, there are a couple of parks nearby that are always packed with families. As for the people, my neighborhood is a crazy mix. We've got a strong LGBTQ+ presence, a big Orthodox Jewish community, and a bunch of immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living together.\n\nVenture a little further out, and you'll find even more diverse pockets, like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and so on.  They're all just a short drive away, but \"short\" can be a relative term in this city. Ten miles can easily turn into a two-hour nightmare thanks to rush hour traffic. \n\nIt's a car-centric place, so most people don't walk around much. Since everything is spread out, even places that seem close can be a pain to get to on foot.  This leads to some of the worst traffic in the world and a never-ending search for parking. Ironically, they're building tons of new apartments, which is great for attracting more people, but not so great for those of us who are already here and struggling with the traffic and parking.\n\nBut hey, at least there's variety in housing. You've got your massive apartment buildings, but also tons of houses, duplexes, smaller apartment complexes, and everything in between.  It's a mixed bag in terms of people too.  I don't really know most of my neighbors, it's not exactly a close-knit community anymore. Back in the day, though, we used to play outside all the time with the kids from the neighborhood. Those were the days.",
            "My neighborhood is a fascinating blend of old and new. Most of the homes are traditional single-family houses, though a few have been divided into two separate units while still sharing a wall. My own place has a small front yard and a tiny driveway. It's the kind of house that whispers of a bygone era when suburban living was the quintessential American dream.  A dream that once felt inclusive, but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood, along with countless others like it, still holds out hope, still calls to us, reminding us that the dream endures. \n\nWhile the optimism might not be as bright as it once was, and the yards aren't always perfectly manicured, there are still cars in every driveway, and kids playing as if they own the world. The old public school, a landmark for nearly 90 years, stands tall, offering a glimpse of the future to today's youth while stirring up memories for the older generation. \n\nChurches are scarce, mostly empty now, but the basketball courts are always buzzing with activity. Every house looks different, yet they share a common feeling, a sense of shared history. There's a large supermarket, \"Super A,\" run by a large Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American, with families who have lived here for generations, their stories weaving a tapestry of a time when everyone knew everyone else. \n\nThere used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood moved on from \"The Karate Kid,\" the kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy – because, as they say, drugs solve everything. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at discounted prices. It's a haven for the older generation, who appreciate a night out without the distractions of today's blockbusters, while the youth look down upon its lack of new releases.\n\nA single expressway cuts through our town, technically entering and exiting in the neighboring town. We once tried to get our own exit, but the youth supported it, while the elders opposed it, arguing that it would ruin our town's charm. They eventually convinced the city council to deny our request. Now, a new high school is being built, and we're debating a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect symbol for our town – a quirky blend of tradition and progress.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance. It's tucked behind a shopping strip in a residential area, not exactly a place you'd expect to find vibrant living spaces. Not the kind of place most people would choose to live. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and behind the hotels that mostly stand empty except for occasional family reunions in the summer, you'll stumble upon a thriving community.  \n\nDown these hidden streets, nestled together like disassembled Russian nesting dolls, are a few apartment complexes. The first ones you encounter have a somewhat shady reputation, so let's not dwell on them. Appearances can be deceiving, right? But the complexes next to those, and the ones after that, are worlds apart, unknown to most people in the area.  \n\nAcross from these apartments sits a quiet satellite campus of a community college. Sleepy students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to start their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters give them the stink eye and grumble about the traffic delays on busier mornings. The road then intersects with another residential street, where a park sits on one side and a rehabilitation center for people recovering from injuries stands on the other. The center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs up the thick summer air. \n\nKids zoom around the park across the street, cartwheeling and playing tag. Bees buzz lazily around the flowerbeds by the road. Older folks walk their dogs along the path, giving teenagers on skateboards a disapproving look and politely nodding at young girls gathered by the playground, gossiping about boys and the latest trends. There's a sushi spot in a nearby strip mall with affordable food but not always a packed crowd. Next to it, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon tucked between them. You could fill your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken, all in one stop - the magic of a strip mall. And don't forget the frozen yogurt place, the DIY kind, where you often see teenagers from the park clutching cold cups covered in toppings while they show off their skateboarding skills and vape, convinced it makes them cool. \n\nThis neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana - a piece of history in sleepy southern town where time seems to stand still.",
            "She asked, \"Where is everything?\" as we drove past endless cornfields stretching as far as the eye could see.  I knew she'd be stunned by the vast emptiness of the landscape. She grew up in a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, so this much open space was completely foreign to her. Overwhelmed by the sea of corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from. \n\nAs we continued down the two-lane road, you'd reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it lies the small development I call home. Mostly brick and stucco houses, each with at least half an acre of land, take pride of place.  Springtime explodes with color from the flowers planted each year, alongside the ever-changing hues of the Midwestern trees. Gleaming Mercedes Benzes, the epitome of luxury, fill the driveways, sparkling in the midday sun after a good wash.\n\nNear my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor always greets me with a warm smile. He spends his days meticulously tending to his lawn, his laughter often accompanying the hum of his lawnmower. Everyone finds his dedication amusing, but he's a genuinely kind soul with a fascinating past.  He's a bit older now, his wit slightly dimmed by time. Once a doctor, he blends seamlessly with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reach my house. Geese roam the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where bullfrogs croak, the water murmurs, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms reaches our ears.  A handmade wooden bridge leads to a secluded oasis untouched by human hands.  Here, trees, herbs, and wildflowers grow wild and free. This was my childhood playground. From building tree forts to 'hunting' (mostly chasing) animals, there was always something to do, and a neighborhood friend was always around.\n\nWinters in our small town are harsh but breathtaking.  The green yard transforms into a desolate wilderness. Trees, once adorned with vibrant flowers, stand bare, skeletal against the sky. When snow falls, it blankets everything in a magical white layer. Snow angels and snowmen line the backyard, remnants of my sister and I's childhood battles. We fought constantly, and during winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We built massive, igloo-like forts to store our arsenal of branches, creating our own winter wonderland. In that world, pretending was everything, and we were just carefree kids.",
            "You gotta get Portland, Oregon. \"Keep Portland Weird,\" it says on a building that's basically a pizza place, bar, music venue, and, well, let's just say it pushes the boundaries a little. Some folks see it as a throwback to the '90s and early 2000s, a time before Portland got famous and pricey, when all sorts of unique subcultures thrived. For others, it's a call to adventure – come to Portland, where \"weird\" isn't a bad thing, it's a badge of honor. Even with all the fancy Californians moving in and the constant construction of condos, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.\n\nNow, \"weird\" doesn't mean everyone's always accepting, but it does mean embracing things that aren't exactly mainstream. It doesn't mean we're immune to modern life – we've got the same Chinese imports as everywhere else. There are a million ways to be \"not normal,\" and Portland has plenty of that. We've got yoga studios, hipsters, business types...maybe \"weird\" is just us taking it all a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. We've got colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers and veggies, and these free boxes piled up in the summer. They're usually just cardboard boxes filled with stuff people are getting rid of, but sometimes it's plastic bags or whatever. It's like a treasure hunt – you never know what you'll find, clothes, books, maybe even something truly bizarre. That's the magic of wandering through Southeast Portland – you're bound to stumble upon something unexpected.\n\nThat's what Portland is all about, at least to me. But I'm just one small piece of the weird puzzle. Some folks wouldn't dream of picking clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They're off doing goat yoga (yes, with real goats!) or cheering on the Timbers (our beloved soccer team). Portland is full of people chasing dreams, big or small, and probably a few too many folks spending their evenings at the bar.\n\nYeah, we've got drug problems. I mean, most places do, and it often boils down to mental health struggles. And the constant rain and gray skies probably don't help. We also have a homelessness problem, which no one seems to have a good solution for. People come here for the social services, which are better than in most places, but they're still not enough. The non-homeless folks are caught between wanting to help and feeling overwhelmed.\n\nSo, yeah, we're not perfect. We're weird, sure, but we're also human, struggling with the same issues as everyone else. But maybe that's part of the weird magic of Portland – embracing the messy, complicated, and ultimately beautiful reality of it all.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, you know?  North of everything, watching the sun rise and set every single day. I can get so caught up in work and life, forget about them entirely. But they're still there, solid, dependable, unbothered by any of my drama. On the days when stress just piles on, I find myself drawn to them. They're like a calming force, giving me a little boost to keep going, one step at a time.  \n\nI remember when I first moved here for college,  it was the mountains just north of campus that really hooked me. The university itself is stunning, with its buildings, ponds, and trees, all holding a special place in my heart. But the mountains? They're the real MVPs. \n\nThe town itself is pretty cool too.  It's got these awesome cafes - perfect for late-night study sessions fueled by caffeine. You can hop on a bus or take a quick walk to downtown, and suddenly you're surrounded by this old-school vibe, with faded brick buildings lining the streets. It's like a mini-city with its own energy, buzzing with life.  But just a few blocks later, you're back in that serene small-town atmosphere, passing by the library and all. It's this weird mix of vibes that makes this place so fascinating. \n\nIt's easy to make memories here, good and bad.  Walking past those rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or racing through downtown to catch a movie at that fancy theater the university scored tickets for. But there are tough memories too, like those late-night existential crises by the ponds.  I've definitely had my share of those.\n\nWatching the turtles and ducks and bugs going about their lives, I'd get lost thinking about my own purpose, struggling to figure out this whole life thing. So, I'd walk past the pond, the park, those little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I hit the main street.  That's when the sun would hit the palm trees, painting the sky with its golden light, and I'd realize I was walking north.\n\nAnd there they were, the mountains, just as they always had been. Towering over everything else, they'd meet the blue and yellow sky, and somehow, just by being there, they'd reawaken this sense of hope inside me.",
            "Alright, so you're thinking about checking out Bensonhurst, huh? Don't sweat finding it, public transit's a breeze in this city. You'll definitely feel like you're in the heart of NYC, it's a proper urban vibe. \n\nGet ready for a serious dose of Asian culture, it's taken over the place in the last twenty years or so. Seriously, you won't walk a block without bumping into an Asian-owned store – supermarkets, laundromats, the whole shebang. And they're super popular, not just with the Asian community, but everyone. The food's top-notch, prices are killer, and it's just so damn convenient. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within spitting distance of each other!  \n\nBut don't get the wrong idea, it's not just an Asian enclave. It's a melting pot, with immigrants and their families making it their home. You'll see a mix of everything, and the big businesses? Mostly Asian-owned.\n\nPlus, there's this super cool renovated park nearby with, like, ten basketball courts, a massive field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a kid's playground – the works. And a water fountain for those scorching summer days. It's a real community hub, you'll see all kinds of people chilling and having a good time.\n\nForget about towering corporate buildings, though. It's mostly co-ops, condos, and two-family houses. \n\nThe people are mostly friendly, but let me tell you, they're LOUD. Cars blaring music, revving engines – it's a symphony of city noise. Be prepared to wake up with a jolt some mornings!\n\nNow, Bensonhurst is generally safe, but you gotta be street smart, especially at night. There are always those unpredictable characters who might cause trouble for no reason.  I've been in a couple of sticky situations here myself, some years back. Package theft is also a thing, nothing new in the city, I guess.\n\nAnd one last thing – dog poop.  Ugh, it's everywhere! People don't seem to care about cleaning up after their pets. Be careful where you step, or you'll be dodging landmines all day long.",
            "Life up here on the hill is a bit... different.  There aren't any sidewalks, so everyone walks in the road, which is pockmarked and pretty rough in spots.  The power lines look like a patchwork quilt after all the storms and the falling branches.  You'd think they'd just take the old, tired trees down, but nope, people love to complain about them blocking the view of the ocean.  That's why so many houses are built high up, with these giant second-story windows trying to catch a glimpse of the water.  It's pretty spectacular at sunset when the bay glows and the sky turns orange, but most days it's cloudy and overcast, so the sunlight just kind of filters through.  You can see moss growing everywhere—roofs, cars, even railings.  I once had to spend three hours scraping moss off my car after leaving it parked for a month.\n\nThe neighborhood is mostly older folks, retired types.  Dogs are more common than kids, and they're always running around, barking, or snooping around for treats.  I had a dog sneak into my living room once!\n\nRabbits are another story.  They're everywhere, digging up gardens and lawns, but my cats love to chase them.  We've got the usual birds too—sparrows, hummingbirds, the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased away by the neighborhood crows.\n\nThere aren't any shops around here, just a few seafood restaurants down by the waterfront if you're willing to hike down the hill.  The beach isn't much to write home about, but we like to chuck rocks into the bay.  It's not very wide, so you can see the other side even through the fog.",
            "I live on a typical suburban street in a small Southern town, Tennessee. It's right between two state highways, so we get more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood.  People move in and out pretty rarely, so I've gotten to know most of the folks around here.  They keep themselves busy with yard work and daily chores, mostly. In the winter, we all sled down the hill on our side street. Our house sits on the corner, so we see everyone coming and going all day. We even know which cars belong to which neighbors. Whenever we spot something unusual, it catches our eye. \n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids are out on their bikes, doing all the usual kid things. We're home a lot since we both work from home. It's just the four of us: me, my wife, and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen. So, everyone else is used to seeing us around too. We get outside and play, even in the rain sometimes. We fire up the grill on the back deck every now and then, and the smell of barbecue always fills the air.\n\nThere's always someone cutting grass – you can practically hear a lawnmower every day from March until about October, when the grass finally slows down. We have a ton of trees because the neighborhood used to be wooded, so there's plenty of shade, but come fall, we're raking and burning leaves constantly. I actually love the smell of burning leaves, so it's a good sign that fall is here. Lately, we haven't had much of a winter at all, so it's felt like a never-ending fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's at the door, which doesn't happen often. I like to work on my truck and other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.\n\nThings are pretty quiet around here on holidays. Thanksgiving brings some extended family, and there are cars parked everywhere. It's the same for Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here.  If it weren't for the traffic, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where it's all dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably can't truly grasp the feeling of constantly seeing brown. And when you do spot a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a small fortune to keep it that way. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night sky. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a ton of new houses popping up. Honestly, it's starting to look more like a city every day, but I guess that's the story everywhere these days. Most of the people here are super friendly, but like any place, you've got your good and bad parts. My neighborhood is surrounded by friendly old folks, so I guess that makes it a pretty decent place to live. \n\nAs for shopping, you're mostly stuck with chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart and Final. For anything upscale, you'd have to drive a good distance – no Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nLooking at the job scene, it seems like construction is king. I'm guessing this is because the city's still pretty undeveloped, with tons of open space just begging to be built on. It kinda scares me, though. I like things the way they are now. I escaped the big city, and I'm not looking to go back anytime soon. Speaking of construction, that's actually where I work full-time. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love most about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the raw beauty of the desert itself is a big draw. The unique climate and landscape create challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to all sorts of fascinating creatures. We, as human residents, should make an effort to learn about these non-human neighbors so we can co-exist peacefully. My family and I have definitely adapted to living with wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs – right now, they're outside trying to catch some specimens!\n\nAs for attractions, we've got a few. Victorville is a great place for families looking for a unique desert experience. If you're visiting, try to time your trip with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast with the perfect mix of activities and fun, Victorville style! \n\nFor something different, head over to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons. \n\nIf you're interested in the history and culture of this high desert ecosystem, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's got geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "Okay, so when people ask me about my neighborhood, it's kinda different from what they're used to. Most folks probably picture houses and lawns, right?  Not me. My neighborhood is the college campus I live on. My dorm is my home base, and all the other students, they're my crew.  The whole campus, well, that's my neighborhood too, just on a bigger scale.  \n\nBut even though it's not your typical neighborhood, it's got the same stuff: houses, people, shops, and even a park. Let's talk about the \"houses\" first.  We've got apartments, regular houses, and dorm buildings.  Apartments are where you'll find groups of 2-4 people per room, usually 4-6 rooms per floor. A typical building has two floors, so maybe 20 people total. Then there are actual houses, like singles or doubles, mostly for alumni. But those are pretty rare around here.  And lastly, there are the dorms, packed with hundreds of students, two per room mostly.  Dorms are the most common place to live on campus.\n\nNow, about the people. My school's all about diversity, so my neighborhood is a melting pot.  You got folks from all walks of life, all ages.  The staff usually lives in those houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones tend to go for apartments.  There's so much to say about the people here, but I'll save it for another time.\n\nOn campus, we're pretty self-sufficient.  We've got a ton of stores, everything from cafes to bookstores to the school's own brand of clothing and groceries.  It's like our own little world!  And don't forget the park. It's a safe space for everyone, kept clean and friendly by everyone who calls this place home.",
            "So, I've been living here for about 10 years now, and figured I'd share some of my experiences.  Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was rough at first.  I was pretty bummed,  I really missed my old neighborhood and friends, you know? But my parents wanted a better life for me and my little sister, so we moved for better schools, housing, and everything they thought was \"not ghetto.\"   It took a while to adjust, met some new people (both friends and frenemies at school), but I never really got to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a while since they lived right next door. They've been awesome, almost like family, and I'm really grateful for them.  I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding with my parents and sister - it was a blast!  It made me think about my future and wanting to give my future wife the same kind of happiness.   There was this funny moment when Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off this little white strap on her leg and threw it, and I actually caught it! Sadly, I missed the bouquet though. We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging out with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but hope she's doing well. \n\nThis neighborhood is like a maze, but now with GPS, I'm ready to explore more. So far, I've mostly hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We were all about video games back in the day, just living it up. Sometimes I'd go to the park, which is super peaceful and calming. I even practice my balance with some sticks I got from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword. It's fun doing the things I love.  There's also a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played in ages. It's cool to have them there just in case. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, and we had a blast. They really pushed us, but it was always fun.  Looking back, I've had so many great times in this neighborhood, there are tons of stories! But these are the ones that really stick with me.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My digs are super close to my college, which is a major perk.  It's mostly apartments around here, with a sprinkle of decent, affordable restaurants and bars.  One bar just got a fancy name change and jacked up the prices, but the drinks aren't *that* bad. Most folks are chill, either students or on a budget since the rent's not astronomical. There are tons of kids around because there's an elementary school practically next door. I'm not exactly BFFs with my neighbors, though. They're the heavy weed-smoking type, so the building management put an air freshener unit right outside their door – talk about awkward! It's kinda insulting, to be honest.\n\nThe buildings around me are old-school, though they might have had a recent makeover inside. Down the street, there are these brand new apartments, but I can't stand them. They're poorly built, overpriced, and the management gets away with it because they're close to campus. It's a total scam! There's this cheap eats joint a few blocks away where everything comes on paper plates and most of it's microwaved.  Right next door is a gas station, which supposedly isn't a great place to work.  \n\nBut, they redid the road last summer thanks to some city cash, so now there's a nice sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area looks a bit nicer. My building itself is kind of hidden away by trees – they cut down a few, but there are still plenty left. Behind the complex is a line of trees, then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd Street, but right behind me is 43rd, which is a bit rougher. The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings look shabby, and there are tons of trees, probably to hide the eyesores! Most of the trouble in the area seems to be coming from an apartment complex on 43rd, but to be fair, the apartments across the street from me aren't exactly angels either – a lot of crime and a revolving door of tenants.\n\nDespite all that, I actually kinda like where I live. It's affordable, convenient, and I'm close to the university and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood's a real throwback. It's got these duplexes lined up on a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they look like individual houses.  They all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, though.  Most of the folks here know each other pretty well. We hang out at the end of driveways, shooting the breeze while the kids play – sidewalk chalk, kites, the usual. It's a nice change of pace from the constant screens and hustle of modern life. Feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, and endless blue skies dotted with puffy clouds. The only bummer? We've been getting tornado warnings lately, and last night, those sirens actually went off! Ended up in the bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows – you know, the essentials. My big dog, though? He wasn't having it. Stuck in the living room, barking his head off, clearly spooked. You could hear the hail pounding on the ground, and after the storm, the street was practically steaming from the temperature swing. Went from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes – the hail melted instantly. Then, as the clouds cleared, the sun came out and started raining again. And wouldn't you know it, a double rainbow appeared! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pics to share with everyone. They were blown away, and so was I. The neighborhood was quiet for a while after the storm, then folks started trickling back home. Back to normal – kids playing, moms chatting, dinner cooking. This place has been a real blessing for me since I moved here from New Hampshire. Love the Southern drawl, gotta admit. \n\nEveryone's got a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, but they're not all the same inside.  Some are surprisingly tiny.  I love taking walks out to the big field behind my place and heading down to the pond (not for swimming, though).  I've spotted deer and in the mornings, you can hear this giant bullfrog croaking his heart out. It's a great place to live, just a hop, skip, and a jump from Charlotte.  Every morning starts with the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. Feels like living in a little village, actually.  There's even a donkey at a farm down the road that brays every evening to let us know he's around. So glad I stumbled upon this little gem of a neighborhood.",
            "So, I moved into this neighborhood right when eighth grade started, and it took a bit to make friends. I ended up getting close to a couple of guys, one lives a couple houses down, and the other's on my street, but they've both moved on now.  Still, the memories stick around. Most of the folks who were here when I first got here are still around, which is cool.  The neighborhood's pretty typical – lots of two-story houses, you know, the standard suburban thing. On sunny days, you can always hear kids playing outside – it's a pretty chill place, mostly quiet during the week.  I've never had any issues with anyone here, folks are pretty much left to their own devices unless they need something. Never had a package stolen off my porch either, so I feel pretty safe.\n\nThere's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my place, and it's got a ton of memories attached to it.  Played tons of basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood guys back in the day. Had a pretty brutal moment too, got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I mostly go there with my cousin's kids – they're way younger and still into swings and slides and whatnot. Just seeing the park gets them super excited, which is kinda heartwarming. It definitely makes me nostalgic for that part of my life.\n\nThis neighborhood's got a good mix of people from all walks of life. You can find all sorts of food places within a mile – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian, the works.  These days, everyone's using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered, though. Fast food is pretty popular here, like pretty much anywhere, and there are tons of pizza places too.  \n\nThere are plenty of stores around here for everything you could need – dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, even a Jewel-Osco, which is a big deal in the Midwest. You can even find a store owned by some folks from India, perfect for getting some homemade or ready-made Indian food if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with my neighborhood. Hearing all the crazy stories about bad neighbors on social media and the news, I feel really lucky to have the ones I do.",
            "My town, Johnston, is like a lot of other small towns in South Carolina. It's pretty unassuming, but it's known for one big thing: peaches!  Everyone here takes pride in the fact that Johnston is the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" and you'll see that slogan plastered all over town. It's mostly just farmland, either peach orchards or cattle grazing.  \n\nThe houses are spread out, most are two stories with metal roofs to beat the heat or gray shingles. They're usually set back from the road, leaving space in front for animals or crops.  The main part of town is where you'll find the only stoplight, which controls traffic at a four-way intersection.  That's also where all the stores are.\n\nFor \"fast food,\" you've got Hong Kong (a tiny Chinese place run by a family), Fiesta Mexican, or Gary's, a small burger chain. We used to have a pizza place, but it closed not too long ago. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  Then there's IGA, the only grocery store in town, which is a bit pricey. People often drive to Batesburg-Leesville to Walmart for their main grocery shopping.  But, the most popular store is probably Dollar General. It's always busy because it's got everything you need!\n\nThere's also a furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a lovely lady who's a fixture in the community. It's been around forever and even has movers to deliver your purchases! Attached to the furniture store is a pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, baths, you name it. The doctor's office and the vet are both small but well-equipped, located away from the main town area.  We have one elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but after fifth grade, kids have to go to the next town for middle and high school.\n\nWe don't really have any parks, although they're trying to build a small recreation area. There aren't any movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to just hang out. It's pretty quiet here.\n\nBut, despite all that, it's a nice town. It's so small you could easily drive through it without even realizing you were in a town at all!",
            "My first encounter with this place was through a podcast about missing persons, which was a bit of a shock.  Rent for apartments around here skyrockets past a thousand bucks a month, and I'd never heard a peep about any disappearances, neither had my buddies. Maybe it's the cost of living getting to folks. I know a few friends who end up crying themselves to sleep over money worries. Things are pricey, but we've learned to be resourceful over time. You start to get used to the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been mothballed for years. You smell less as an adult, you might pick up smoking, or maybe you just get used to the state of things. But the flea market feeling always sneaks back. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It gets stuck in the leather and lingers even after washing.  \n\nThere are at least three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a place full of oddities.  Downtown's a bustling hive of cars and people every morning, but inside those thrift stores, it's silent. No matter how many people or cars zip by, the silence holds. It's a perfect spot to lose track of an afternoon. Every year, more and more of those places pop up. Cars and people flood the streets. It's a growing city, they say. Hosting one of the biggest online empires for shopping and delivery, it's still going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's focused on their own goals, and nobody expects much from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into each other's lives. You can keep your walls up as long as you want, and the city just rolls along like waves on the beach. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we're less like an apartment building full of strangers and more like a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and to help each other out when needed.  \n\nI'm lucky to be here, honestly. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them snacks, and they do the same for me. We trade mail, and it's nice to see each other. I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, impersonal modern complex, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess things up.",
            "My neighborhood is like, the definition of cookie-cutter suburbia. You know, the kind where the homeowner's association is basically running the show.  Step inside, and it's a parade of identical single-family homes, all perfectly manicured lawns, matching driveways, and those little patches of pebbles everyone loves.  Oh, and don't forget the two-car garages, standard issue for every house.   You'll be cruising down these freshly paved roads, and it's like, zero potholes in sight.  Most houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll bump into a two-story one.  Mailboxes are a little different here too. No individual boxes out front, instead, it's more like an apartment building deal – a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, everyone using a key to grab their own. And there are these giant lockers for packages, just in case those aren't small enough.  Thanks, HOA, for keeping things, well, *uniform*.\n\nLiving on the outskirts of the city, my neighborhood's kind of a mix of suburbia and rural.  We've got a ton of space.\n\nMultiple community pools, all gated and sparkling clean.  And these walking trails that snake through the neighborhood, perfect for your daily dog walk or a quiet evening stroll. No need to find a park, you can just run laps around the whole place.  Most people here are retired folks, super friendly and always looking out for each other.  You've got your share of middle-aged and young professionals mixed in too.  \n\nThe city itself is surprisingly big, but it's got that small-town vibe.  We've got the essentials, like one mall (not huge, but it gets the job done).  About a 15-minute drive gets you to all the big box stores you could ever want, from fancy organic grocery stores to those bargain outlets with barely any staff. \n\nAll in all, my neighborhood's pretty typical, safe, well-kept, and boring.  Nice things, like pools and trails, but not exactly a party scene.  You want something, hop in the car and it’s a quick trip to whatever chain store you need.",
            "I call this small Midwestern town home, just outside a big city's suburbs. My neighborhood, on the east side, is the least wealthy part of town. Houses are mostly rented or owned by folks who aren't rolling in dough. But it's not a bad place to live. My neighbors are mostly friendly folks who wave and say hello when I'm out and about. Sure, crime rates are a tad higher than in other parts of town, but they're not out of control. There have been a few violent incidents nearby over the past decade, including some shootings and even a homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting outside a local bar, which was heartbreaking. Luckily, our family has stayed safe, though we've had the occasional porch pirate make off with something if we're not careful.\n\nThe \"opioid epidemic\" has hit our town pretty hard, like a lot of places in the US. It's stolen too many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are resources here, like rehab centers and Narcan training for families and friends dealing with addiction. \n\nDespite these struggles, there's a lot to love about our town. My son's elementary school has a fantastic staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He's thrived there, even with his special needs, because the school has such a positive atmosphere, and he hasn't faced any bullying. We have a super active Parent Teacher Organization that throws events all year to get families involved and boost learning.  Since over 20% of our town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so no kid goes hungry. They make sure no one feels less than because they can't afford things, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are really reasonable.\n\nThe City Council has put effort into sprucing up town, repaving roads, landscaping, and fixing up parks. Most of these improvements are downtown and on the west side, where the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, tends to get overlooked, which a lot of people in our neighborhood find frustrating.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, we've got enough shopping options (both small businesses and big chains) to get what we need, and our house might not be worth much, but it's comfortable and fits our family. We've been here for over 16 years, and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is bursting with character. It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings with stories to tell. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live theater, and just down the street is this awesome little arcade bar that draws all sorts of people on warm summer nights. You'll often see a line snaking down the block, especially on weekends during June and July. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, surprisingly spacious for the area. It's surrounded by concrete with steep stairs built right into the wall. During the harsh winter months, homeless people set up tidy rows of tents along the sidewalk and those wide stairs. It doesn't snow much, but the rainstorms in mid-winter can be brutal, making it tough to stay warm.  Clustering their tents together in the heart of town instead of out in the open keeps them warmer and they're within walking distance of the only family center for miles, where they can shower and clean up. What I truly love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its history – the towering buildings, the architecture that climbs the hills rolling down to the ocean. It's the people that make my neighborhood special.  Hilltop used to be the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you still hear stories about the feds and the DEA cracking down, trying to clean up the streets. The people remember. Those stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. They work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher areas in the city, to keep it clean and safe. They care about their city, their block. People say if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I think it's a relic of the old days, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Maybe because I'm dark enough to pass for something other than a \"white girl,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the constant reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions that stem from ignorance and fear, even in a city that's supposed to be a melting pot of cultures. One thing's for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more often offered me a jacket than tried to rob me. It's a place where the laundromat owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone when I was caught in the rain. It's a place where, huddled against a concrete storefront on a bleak night, I felt invisible, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call home a little slice of Rural America, specifically a small town in Michigan. You'll find fields of crops transitioning into quaint tourist spots, but forget big city amenities like malls, Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee's.  Getting around means hopping in the car because everything's a drive.  Even with that,  I think I live in one of the most beautiful places on Earth, surrounded by water. My town sits snuggled between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix –  think beaches just steps away no matter where you are. \n\nMy neighborhood screams \"small town USA.\" Houses aren't crammed together, and they're not those cookie-cutter creations. They're older homes, some spruced up and modernized, others keeping their vintage charm. Most have full basements you can easily spot from the street.  You'll see a mix of aluminum siding, with houses painted in every color imaginable lining the streets. Most have yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for the family pets. They paint a picture of hard-working folks, raising families or enjoying the fruits of their labor. \n\nKids zoom up and down the sidewalks, you'll spot people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading.  There's a real sense of community here; neighbors know each other, and you can quickly tell who belongs and who's just passing through.  You'll see someone grilling out and get a friendly wave, or a passerby walking their dog will offer a warm smile. Lawns are well-kept; no piles of leaves, just neat, mowed grass and trimmed bushes. It's not about flashy mansions, but about a place that feels like home. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe – a place you'd want to raise a family. \n\nThe county sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, followed by the health department. The city's recycling center is just down the road, serving residents from all corners. Nearby, you'll find baseball and softball fields, where you can hear the excitement of the announcers and the cheers of the crowd. Our small town airport sits right next to it, so you'll hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing, whether you're inside or outside.  A quick stroll takes you to the local ice cream shop, and if you're feeling ambitious, you can bike or walk into downtown.\n\nMy kids can ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away. It's a truly great place to live."
